I replaced my old one with this without a hitch.
This may help InSinkErator Model BADGER-1: Badger 1 1/3 HP Garbage Disposal PRODUCT DETAILS - Bellacor Number:309641 / UPC:050375000419 Brand SKU:500181
Plumbing connections will vary with different models. Usually the larger higher amp draw wil not affect the wiring, the disposals are designed to a basic standard setup common to all brands. They want you to buy their brand or version or model. As long as the disposal is UL listed, United Laboratories, they will setup and bolt up the same.
It does not come with a power cord. It does come with the dishwasher hookup.
Check if you dropped something inside.Usually my wife put lemons inside make a lot of noise and I will have to get them out using my hands or mechanical fingers .
on the bottom
If your garbage disposal is leaking out the bottom near the reset button, you most likely have a leak in the metal plate that is located directly under the blades. This plate is designed to protect the electrically powered parts of the motor (the rotor, the shaft, etc.) from moisture, but it is rather thin and is only made of galvanized steel. After a year or two, especially if you use highly acidic cleaners which you rinse down your sink, the zinc layer will corrode and expose the steel, which will then also start to corrode, until something hard eventually pokes some kind of hole through the plate somewhere (could be somewhere very small), signaling the end of the machine's service life. The plate is not meant to be repaired, only replaced along with the rest of the unit. That water is getting through to your rotor is an electrical hazard, and should be dealt with immediately (by removing the damaged unit). The manufacturer has figured out that the blades need to me made of stainless steel, but has chosen to skimp on making other interior parts of this more-expensive metal. Good luck!
I ttok mine off of the broken unit and installed it on the new one.
I replaced my a couple of months ago, I'm semi-handy fixing a lot of small stuff around the house. I'm small and in my late seventies, the only problem was holding the unit up in place while turning the locking ring. I no longer have the upper body strength to do it so I used a stack of books. Made sure all the connections were tight and have had so problems since. It clean and in good shape so I left the old badger mount in the sink. Took about forty min, but a lot of that was getting the books.
It fit the same as the one we replaced
Yes it will. The sink connector is even the same
yes, I did it with mine.
Not difficult as long as you have a helper or something to prop up the replacement as you screw it into place.
If I understand your present disposal 3 bolts the twist type should be no problem. When you order it is a bit confusing as to what comes with the disposal. When they show people often order some things when the get the disposal. You don't need any of those it all come with it the only thing you might need would be some different drain pipe but most likely you won't. I hope I was some help. Bill
If you mean the rubber collar that is visible when looking at the drain, with the rubber flaps, then yes it does.
yes.
I'm looking for the same item because I have a small espresso machine that has a footprint much smaller than the smallest burner. Is there anything that's on the market for such an issue? Glass tops are a pain.
I use the Nordic on all size electric burners. It instructs to turn the heat to medium after achieving full heat. This is important to prevent warping. Only one per pkg. Beware - treated with something that smells terrible until it burns off.
yes it can.i use it on my grills side burner to slow boil leftover marinades and veggies.
This is purportedly for all heat sources. Heat is heat and the heat WILL distort this sooner or later. My stove was electric and the first time I used it, it warped. If you want to hammer it out after using it, give it a shot. Heat diffusers are a good thing for cooking, particularly on an electric stove which is notorious for hot spots. It's warped but I still use it.
I don't see how it could be used that way, no. I ordered one for that same purpose assuming it was a solid plate, but this is a stamped steel disc with a raised rim for it to slip over a conventional burner. The only way I could see it working on an induction cooktop would be to place it upside down and then use a pan or pot that is smaller than the raised rim.
this is a flat diffuser for a burner. it distributes heat evenly and prevents thinner steel pans from scorching. can be used for toasting tortillas, not for other direct food applicatioms. pots and pans only.
Yes, I think it should be fine. I've been using mine on a gas stove with no problems.
maybe a single electric burner?
It is my understanding that these were made for standard electric and gas burners. As they are metal I do not think they would work for induction cooktops. My suggestion would be to contact the induction top manufacturer for an expert answer. Sincerely, C. Dalzell
Probably, and maybe too much. I use mine to prepare small batches of sauce (experimental stuff) and it's hot enough, even with the gas on low on my middle size burner, to get a slow boil. I would not recommend a glass carafe, personal preference, but a metal type.

just once. there are several types of test in the box but they're each designed to only be used once.
The kit contains ONE strip per test. So if you want to test 12 water sources you could pool them. A better plan might be to buy two kits and test a pool of 6 water sources for each. That way if one set is positive, you only need to buy 6 more, for a total of 8 kits, rather than 12.
no, there is only one test kit for each substance. You could only test two if you mixed them together and did it as a pooled sample.
We used it to test for lead and we have no reason to believe the result was inaccurate. All of its other tests gave results that made me feel like the test was genuine.
The state doesn't have any protocols for rapid screening tests
All the tests are based on color . For the lead test, it's a line indicator.
You would need to go through a lab to get the exact amount. With this kit you follow a color chart and compare to the EPA standard
YES. On the back side of the plastic packaging which houses the contents including the instructions and different package envelopes which contain the chemicals for the variety of tests. There are no dates on the individual test envelopes that I can see. BUT there is definitely an expiration date on the back outside of the clear plastic packaging right next to the words "Watersafe City Water Test Kit." I hope this is a clear explanation and that it helps.
It has a test for bacteria for example E.Coli, however the bacteria test does not specify what kind you have in there.
Yes it does.
Filter for vicks3 is NOT a question. What are you asking?
The outer shell will fall apart in about a year of use, but the filter itself can survive much longer. Mine split at the seam, so it's no longer round, but it still fits in the humidifier, and does its job. Cleaning the filter every week (especially if you have hard water) will degrade the material over time. I've used one in this manner for 3 years so far.
The only humidifiers that this will fit are Sunbeam SCM866, SCM1895, and SCM1896 and Holmes HM1865 and HM1895 according to the filter box. So I think the answer to your question is "No". Sorry.
Its generic and does not work in a Holmes humidifier!!!
Hi: yes, we would bundle all 5 filters and charge one shipping price.
its for the hwf65. I see other vendors do have the filter with the black mesh like the picture shows.
All I know is that I have an older model of the Holmes room humidifier. it doesn't have any code on it. anyway, the filter was too tall, but it did fit. so I cut it in half (very hard to do with chic hands. but I did it) and now I have 2 filters for the price of one! other than all that, I'm happy w/it.
Works with Holmes and Sunbeam humidifier model #s HM1100, HM1118, HM1119, HM1120, HM1300, HM1700, HM1701, HM1740, HM2025, HM2030, HM1230, HM1275, HM1280, HM1281, HM1285, HM1295, HM1296, HM1297, HM1740, HM1450, HM2408, HM2409, HM1760, HM1761, SCM1100, SCM1701, SCM1702, SCM1762, SCM2409, SCM4100 Package Quantity: 1 Filter Size: 5.3x2x9.5 Features: Antimicrobial Protection Compatible With: Holmes & Sunbeam humidifiers
I'm not an expert. Let me start to answer your question with a question. Is there an outer core in any other color that is made of a different material than the inner core? The inner core (white in the picture) is softer to the touch; the outer core, I suspect is what helps it stand up. I don't think the color matters. The outer core feels like plastic. The inner core is definitely not plastic. I suspect the color does not matter. If this doesn't completely answer your question, ask away. I enjoy doing this.
I just googled it and it says this filter works for it.
Yes it does.
No. That is part of the filter and provides support.
yes
Don't have an issue with the filter rotting or smelling bad after usage. If you don't plan on using it much, the water container should be emptied and the filter dried out.
Your water may have a high mineral content. Please be sure to always have water in the unit to prevent the filter from drying. Also, we recommend changing the wick filter every 4 weeks.
I suppose so if you keep it clean I get a new filter each year
6" H x 1" W (diameter of filter is 7")

i have no idea
I have the GF 300 and I use a EUV-13B bulb and this bulb is specifically rated for the GF 220. You can get it right here at Amazon and it costs only $9.00.
Sorry, don't really know the differences!?!?
I do not know the answer............Not sure
It fit my Tappan stove.
The bushings that you see are made to fit many different size shafts, but I am not sure how many millimeters. If I remember they will fit four different sizes.
They are to make the knobs fit,but the knobs kept falling off even with those.
They did not work on my stove,
I am so sorry but at this time i do not. towertree*58
If your buttons need to be pushed down to turn these might not work. We have a kenmore. And they did not work for to that reason
i couldn't use these knobs at all and actually broke one trying to install. they look like they fit, but when you press down to turn, it only works the first time. what a waste of money. i should have return them but
Don't know for sure but they come with adapters that I used.
Hi if your old knobs pull off, then yes these should fit. It comes with different size know adaptors
I think they will fit any electric stove.it comes with various size fittings for the stem.

This vent is used indoor where there is no way to vent outside. As long as you are sure there is always water in the trap - it works fine. You will have some humidity, but no worse than anything else.
No, it is not smooth.
I empty it out every single load. You can probably get two loads, unless it is something that produces a lot of lint.
I would check it after every dryer run. The water evaporates quickly.
No. The way it works is that the tray is about half full of water (there is a line you fill it up to). The air hits the water and that catches MOST of the lint. It isn't 100% effective - a little still flies out. But it is a good bit more effective than you'd think it would be. I think it basically gets the lint wet enough that it is too heavy to escape. Remember this is only catching the lint that the lint screen inside the dryer missed - it isn't anything like the amount per load you pull out of the dryer lint screen.
I don't really know as this didn't work out for us. I guess I didn't read the description well enough to know you needed to keep water in the boxt. It was going to be too difficult for us to constantly do that. However, I don't see why not it wouldn't work as the hose comes out of the dryer and into the little box. Surely if it can't be used for a gas dryer, they would put that in the description. Sorry I could not be of more help.
I believe there's a disclaimer on these units that they should not be used on gas dryers. Gas dryers really need to be vented outdoors because, unlike electric dryers, there's combustion and that results in fumes. The other vent shown with this one... Dundas Jafine TDIDVKZW ProFlex Indoor Dryer Vent Kit... states in the description "Not be used with gas clothes dryers". I would not do it.
Hello, I suggest that you take the aeroators off both kitchen and bathroom faucet, take them AND the adapter to home depot or lowes. In the bathroom section, they sell what is called AERATOR ADAPTERS. Ask one of the staff to help you and your problem will be resolved quickly.
Can you clarify? Is the water not flowing from the *machine* tub into your *shower* tub where you're draining into? Or is water not coming into the Haier tub? Your question is hard to answer as I'm not sure which tub the water isn't going into, but if you can clarify, we can probably help figure this out for you.
hi. i don't know about rpm's, but my (new) washer spins clothes almost dry! it's great in that way and in many others...i just can't seem to get the lint filter out to clean it.
Pull from the side and bend it forward - it should pop out. My washer is not spinning the water out correctly - the pulsator is moving but it is not moving reapidly as it once was and now the clothes are full of water -- the washer drains without problem - it just does not seem to be spinning out correctly - any ideas ? MARY
It comes with one AAA battery.
No, I wish it did! Can't read it when baby's sleeping.
