[ [ I guess, +
I think, ] + {F uh, } I wonder ] if that worked. /
I think it usually does.  /You might try, {F uh, }  /I don't know,  /hold it down a little longer,  /{C and } see if it, {F uh, } -/
Okay  /[ I, +
{D Well, } I ] don't remember.  /It seemed like it did,  /{C but } <laughter> it might not.  /[ I guess + --
-- I guess ] we can start.  {F Uh, } /
No,  /[ I don't, + I don't ] have any kids.  /[ [ I, + {F uh, } my sister has a, ] + she just had a ] baby,  /he's about five months old  /{C and } she was worrying about going back to work and what she was going to do with him and --
-- the different, - /do you have kids? /
{F Oh, } really? /
<Laughter>.
Uh-huh. /
Yeah. /
{F Uh, } yeah  /she lives, - /[ it's a, + it's a ] fairly large community.  /She, {F uh, } got real lucky, though.  /He had a boss who, {F uh, } moved into a larger office -- /
-- {C and } she's able to take her baby to work with her. /
{C And } it's a small office that she works in -- /
-- {C and, } {F uh, } [ it's a, + it's a ] legal [ firm, + office, ]  /{C and } it's just one lawyer -- /
-- {C and so } she's the only one really that takes care of the office.  /There's no one else that works there. /
{C And so } they have an extra room and everything for the baby,  /{C so } it works out pretty good for her. /
<Laughter>.
Yeah. /
Yeah,  /{C so } it's fairly safe. /
Worried that they're not going to get enough attention? /
Yeah. /
Yes. /
Yeah,  /[ {C and } you, + {C and } you ] don't always even know if [ it's, + it's ] going to be the right place or not. /
Anything, I guess, could happen. /
[ {C Because } after, + I guess after ] he, {D you know, } gets to a certain age she's going to have to take him to a day care. /
Yeah. /
[ [ When, + when he's not, ] + when she can't ] keep control of him  /{C and } he starts crawling  /that's, -/
Uh-huh. /
<Laughter>.
Yeah. /
I think she has problems with that, too. /
I don't know -- /
-- that's something I've considered.  {F Uh, } /
I always kind of think it would be neat to be able to watch them and be there for them all the time. /
Is that what you do? /
{F Oh, } {C so } they don't go to school.  /Is it like, {F uh, } - /{F oh, } what's that called,  /it's, {F uh, } correspondence school,  /they do it --
-- at home. /
That's interesting. /
Do you have to have any special training? /
{C So } they haven't been to public schools at all. /
{F Um. } /
{D Well, } {F uh, } does the company you work for test for drugs? /
{F Huh. } /
{F Uh, } no,  /we're not being tested for drugs at all, {F uh, }  /our policies and procedures manual, {F uh, } the furthest it goes about drugs is in [ the, + kind of the ] miscellaneous section, or --
-- it's reasons for immediate dismissal,  /it says, use of narcotics on company premises. /
{C So } that's pretty general,  /{C but, } {F uh, } I work for an environmental management firm -- /
-- {C and } I'm an engineer there,  /{C but } I do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites,  /{C but } I don't operate any machinery. /
{D Now, } people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that --
-- are under [ a, + a ] medical monitoring program,  /{C because } they're at a higher risk of exposure  /{C and } blood screening is part of that  /{C and } [ I, + I ] think that drugs, - /they do test for drugs in that capacity,  /{C but } it's not their exclusive, - /[ it's just part, + it's just something ] that turns up in the other parameters that they test for. /
{C But } I think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field.  /What is the nature of your company's business? /
{F Um. } /
{F Oh, } really? /
Right. /
[ We, + that's ] been [ [ an, + a, ] + an ] issue, {F uh, } in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening.  /((In fact)), they'll <laughter> have these little parties,  /{C and } people will just get, - /{E I mean, } I've, - /my brother lives where I work,  /{C and } I have many a time called him to come get me, {D you know. }  /[ {C And, } + {F uh, } {F uh, } {C but, } ] [ y-, + {D you know, } ] they don't think twice about serving beer by the keg.
{D You know, }  /{C but, } {F uh, } I think drug testing, - /{C and } [ I, + I ] don't know,  /[ [ I guess + I k-, ] + I think ] it's got some relevance,  /{C but } I think its relevance is pretty limited.  /{E I mean, } I think, {D you know, } - /in your case, I don't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing. /
I think that's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident. /
Uh-huh. /
Oh. /
Right. /
Yeah,  /I have some friends of mine who use Quicken  /{C and, } {F uh, } I've considered using it once myself,  /{C but } I decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date. /
{C So } [ I, + I ] kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken, at least for now. /
Uh-huh. /
Yeah,  /{D well, } it's similar problems  /{C but, } {F uh, } we just have the one check book  /{C and } we <inhaling> try to keep it up to date as much as possible  /{C and } occasionally we will get behind like you say  /{C but, } {F uh, } <inhaling> it doesn't really seem to be [ too, + too ] tight if we just remember to keep everything [ up, + up ] to date and balanced. /
{D Well, } how to you handle that, the long range or medium range planning on finances? /
Uh-huh. /
Yeah.  /{D Well } that's pretty good if you can do that.  /I know.  /I have a daughter who's ten  /{C and } we haven't really put much away for her college up to this point  /{C but, } {F uh, } we're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away --
-- for college,  /{C so } we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction --
-- in the fall  /{C and then } the money that I will be making this summer we'll be putting away for the college fund. /
Uh-huh. /
Uh-huh. /
{D Well } our situation is just [ a little bit, + kind of the opposite ] of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently, {F uh, } took on a full time job, {D well } almost full time. /
{C So, } it's only recently that we've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for, {F uh, } long range goals like college and sickness and --
-- travel and that kind of thing. /
{F Oh, } Stockton. /
How about you? /
Uh-huh. /
{F Uh, } a colleague of mine at, {F uh, } work got some information over, {F uh, } the computer network called INTERNET. /
{C And } he just forwarded that on to me  /{C and, } {F uh, } it sounded like it would be an interesting project --
-- to participate in  /{C so } I --
-- sent back (( )) mail. /
Uh-huh. /
Uh-huh. /
{D Well } what other long range goals do you have besides college? /
Uh-huh. /
Uh-huh. /
<Sneezing> [ [ Ou-, + ou-, ] + our ] judicial system is in such total chaos. /
I think what they need to do is, they need to somehow <lipsmack> take the money out of it.  /{E I mean, } when you have a man that's signed [ [ a, + a, ] + a ] statement saying he's guilty, - /we have [ a, + a ] family called All day family.  /They were all murdered. /
All the people signed confessions,  /they went to a trial by jury.  /They been trying these people now for twenty-two years, ever since I was a child. /
{C And } what they've done is they've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they've done,  /has nothing to do with justice whatsoever. -/
{F Uh, } that's true.  /[ [ I, + I, ] + I ] think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself. /
[ I, + I ] hold it in the utmost contempt. /
[ [ The, + {F uh, } d-, ] + my ] favorite is the police department,  /<breathing> they're not aimed at the criminal.  /The judicial system is aimed at the citizens  /{C because } you and I, we have work schedules,  /we can be called at work,  /we have Social Security numbers,  /they can trace us down,  /we have telephones,  /then we have checkbooks.  /Criminals have none of these things.  /They're real difficult to catch,  /{C and } if they do catch them, they don't get any monetary gain out of it, whereas [ us, + we ] write a check. /
{C So } where do you think they target their efforts? /
They target their efforts toward the citizens --
-- not the criminals. /
<Throat_clearing> {D You know, }  that's a, - /I've   nailed the problem down  /{C but } I, -/
<Laughter>.
Yeah,  /I'm going to have to leave those details like, what would you do about, - /I think, to begin with, [ you would h-, + you would have, ] - /{D like, } here in Atlanta area, our crime rate is just astronomical,  /{C yet, } you go out on the streets  /{C and } they're giving speeding tickets. /
I think somehow you have to separate the revenues from, -/
