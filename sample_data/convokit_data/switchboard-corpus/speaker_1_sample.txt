Okay.  /{D So, }
What kind of experience [ do you, + do you ] have, then with child care? /
Does it say something? /
Okay <beep>.  /<<long pause>> {D Well, }
Does it usually make a recording or s-, /
Okay. /
Okay. /
Uh-huh. /
I have three. /
Uh-huh. /
Yeah,  /I do <laughter>.  /Yes, {F uh, }  /I don't work, though,  /{C but } I used to work [ and, + ] when I had two children. /
I work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit,  /{C but } I don't envy anybody who's in that <laughter> situation to find day care. /
{C But, } does your sister live in a big community? /
Uh-huh. /
{F Oh, } really? /
Uh-huh. /
{F Um. } /
Uh-huh. /
Wow. /
How lucky <laughter>.  /[ I, + I ] know a lot of people around here sometimes have, {D like, } mothers or grandmothers --
-- that take care of their kids  /[ {C and, } + {C but, } ] the community I'm in is not a real large one,  /{C so } there are a lot of people who babysit in their homes that, {D you know, } - /you either know them or know somebody who knows them <laughter>, to get to, -/
Yeah,  /to get references and that,  /[ {C so, } + {C but, } ] {F uh, } - /[ I, + I ] [ d-, + don't ] feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center, [ but, + ] simply because there's so many kids and so many <sniffing> <throat_clearing>, -/
Yeah,  /{C and, } {F uh, } {D you know, } colds and things like that <laughter> get --
-- spread real easy and things,  /[ {C but, } + {C and } ] they're expensive  /{C and, } <lipsmack> course, there's a lot of different types of day care available, too, {D you know, } where they teach them academic things.  /
{C Or } they just watch them and let them play and things like that,  /{C but, } - /take a long time to find the right place  /<laughter>.
Uh-huh. /
Uh-huh. /
Uh-huh,  /when he starts toddling around and stuff. /
Yeah. /
Uh-huh.  /It would be hard,  /I think it would be kind of stressful.  /It would be nice to have him around -- /
-- {C but, } {F uh, } seems like, {D you know, } - /goll-, - /what if he cried at the wrong time  /<laughter> {C or } the phone rang [ or, + ]
{D you know, } at the wrong time <laughter>. /
{C But, } -/
Uh-huh.  /{D Well, } when you have kids, will you work?  /Do you --
-- work now? /
Uh-huh. /
Uh-huh. /
{F Uh, } yeah.  /{D Actually, } I teach my kids at home,  /{C so } I'm here all the time. /
Uh-huh. /
Yeah,  /yeah. /
{D So, } -/
Not, - /it depends on the state you live actually.  /Some laws absolutely prohibit it.  /Some states, {F uh, } say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that.  /Our state doesn't yet, <laughter> say that  /{C and } I'm not a certified teacher.  /I went to college,  /[ {C but } I, + {D you know, } {C but } my kids ] are only elementary [ grades, + levels ] right now  /{C and so, } -/
One of them was for a couple of years  /{C and so, } {D you know, } my oldest, he was,  /{C and then } my youngest two have never been. /
{D So } {D anyway, } - /{C but } we don't, -/
{D Actually, } {F uh, } they just recently started a policy of testing drugs, which was kind of interesting,  /{C because } [ w-, + when ] I went to work for them, {F uh, } they didn't do that,  /{C but, } {F uh, } since then [ they've, + they've ] started a drug testing policy, not because of their own, {F uh, } convictions, but because the clients of our company [ are + ] requests that we do that. /
How about you? /
Uh-huh. /
{F Um. } /
<Laughter> Okay. /
Yeah. /
Uh-huh. /
Yeah. /
{D Well, } it's actually, {F uh, } - /we do oil well services.  /{C So, } a lot of our clients are [ oil companies, + big oil companies, ]  /{C and } they go out to, - /<inhaling> we have engineers who, {F uh, } go out [ to the oil well, + <thumping> [ to the, + to the ] client's oil well, ] [ and, + and ] work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff,  /{C so } the clients are very concerned that, {D you know, } the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy, because they're on [ their, + their, ] {D you know, } territory and everything,  /{C but } --
-- the thing that's interesting is that [ I w-, + I'm an ] engineer [ and, + ] a software engineer  /{C and } I work in the software, {F uh, } house,  /{C and } everybody there, {D you know, } are all software engineers.  /[ They've never, + {D you know, } they never ] go out to [ the, + the ] oil rigs or anything,  /{C and } yet, [ we're getting, + we're subjected ] to this policy, {D you know, } the same one that, {F uh, } [ th-, + all the ] engineers have [ to, + to, ] - /{D well, } a little different, actually, - /{C but, } {F uh, } {D you know, } we have to go through the same thing,  /[ [ {C and } it's, + {C but } it's, ] + {F uh, } it's ] a little different, I guess [ than + <noise>, than ] a lot of drug policies.  /In our case, it's like, when you hire on, they'll test you,  /{C and } then if you get injured on the job, if you {D like } trip and fall or something, {F uh, } they give you a drug test right away.  /
Other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that,  /{C but, } a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first.  /Particularly, {D like } <laughter>, {F uh, } we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol,  /{C and } [ tha-, + they ] didn't find any problem with that, {D you know, }  /{C but, } -/
{F Uh, } -/
Yeah <laughter>. /
Yeah. /
Yeah,  /[ it's really, + it's really ] bizarre.  /{F Uh, } particularly, {D like } where we are, {D you know. }  /[ I, + I, ] - /there was a story of a woman last year [ who, + who ] actually did slip on the ice [ and, + and ] {D like } sprained her ankle  /{C and } [ she, + she ] was a personnel secretary  /{C and } she <laughter> had to get tested  /{C and, } I don't know  /I'm ambivalent about the whole thing.  /[ I, + {D you know, } I ] have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand, it's like if, {D you know, } - /[ they're, + they should ] be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense  /{C and, } {D you know, } it's like [ you're, + {E I mean, } employments are ] contractual by nature anyway -- /
-- {C but, } {F uh, } I had an experience when I was interviewing for a job [ that, + ] where I had to, {F uh, } {F uh, } do a drug test  /[ {C and, } + {C and } ] [ it's, + it was ] kind of a long story,  /{C but } [ it was, + it was ] just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through,  /{C and } it amounted to, {F uh, } going in, {F uh, } before any of these interviews,  /I'm not even working for this company,  /I'm going in for, {D like, } interviews  /{C and } they flew me out to Chicago  /[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] {F uh, } before I went into any of the interviews, {F uh, } they took me to the doctor to give me a physical.  /They said it was going to be a physical, {D you know, }  /{C and, } {F uh, } {D actually } [ bec-, + beforehand ] they told me they were going to, {F uh, } do drug screening,  /{C but } I had forgotten about that,  /{C and so, } basically, I'd already peed off ((in)) that morning  /[ {C and, } + {C and } ] when I got in there, [ I didn't, + I wasn't, ] {D like, } able to give a full sample,  /{C and so } --
-- they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes, drink a whole ton of water --
{F Uh, } the question was kind of interesting to me because I was just trying to put together a, {F uh, } long term financial plan and monthly budget.  /The only thing I do now is, {F uh, } put the data into Quicken.  /I don't know if you are familiar with that. /
Uh-huh. /
{F Um. }  I've found it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then, {D well, } {F uh, } {F uh, } not bother to total it -- /
-- {C and then } it comes in to doing all the arithmetic.  /{C So } it really helps with that. /
Uh-huh. /
{D Well, } {D actually } we haven't had to.  {F Uh, } until just recently.  /I guess we've got [ a, + a ] daughter who is eighteen months and another one on the way  /{C so } --
-- we needed to start doing more of that just for, {F uh, } {D you know, } saving for college and things like that.  /We [ tried a way, + try to put ] away two and four thousand a year just for that. /
Uh-huh. /
{F Um. } /
{F Um. }  Sounds good.  /Yeah,  /I guess [ we're, + we're ] just at the point, {F uh, } - /my wife worked until we had a family  /{C and then, } {D you know, } now we're just going on  the one income  /{C so } it's --
-- a lot more interesting trying to, {F uh, } - /find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to, {F uh, } do it.  /{D You know, } kind of enforce the savings. /
{C But, } {F uh, } it will be interesting to see (( )). /
{F Um. } /
{F Um. } /
That sounds good.  /{C But, } {F uh, } {F uh, } I was just curious, what, {F uh, } part of the country. -/
{F Oh, } okay. /
{F Uh, } Cincinnati, actually.  /I was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with, {F uh, } the western accents or something like that.  /I don't know how many people are, {F uh, } getting involved in this  /{C but } --
-- {F uh, } {D well } that's interesting.  /[ I'm, + {F uh, } {F uh, } {D actually, } {F uh, } I ] was kind of interested if you found out about the study by, {F uh, } reading TELECOM DIGEST  /{C or } was there another? /
{F Oh, } okay.  /Yeah,  /that is how I got it as well  /{C but, } {F uh, } -/
Uh-huh. /
Yeah,  /[ it will be interesting to see what, +
It would be interesting to see how ] the data base, - /(( )) {D so, } {D well, } I guess we're talking about the experiment. /
{F Uh, } probably need to try to get back on the topic  /{C but, } {F uh, } it's hard to talk about finances [ without + without ] getting to, {F uh, } dollar figures I guess --
-- {D you know, }  /we could talk about some of the long range goals  /{C and, } -/
{F Uh, } {D well } I think, either my wife or I would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point -- /
-- {F uh, } I guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that.  /It seems like every year my employer just gives back, {D you know, } a little bit your tuition reimbursement. /
Right,  /{F uh, } {D actually } I lived over in Europe for a couple of years,  /I lived in Germany  /{C and } in Germany they don't have the jury system.  /What they do is they have, {F uh, } three judges, basically.  /{C And } you get up there  /{C and } the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence  /{C and } your defense attorney presents their evidence  /{C and } those three guys take the evidence, go off, figure it out and then come back and say whether you're guilty or not. /
<Laughter>. /
Uh-huh. /
Wow. /
<Breathing> {D Well, } {D you know, } [ it's, + it's ] one of those things,  /{E I mean, } {F uh, } {F uh, } I would have to look at it.  /[ I-, + if ] they did it with [ the, + {F uh, } just the ] judges,  the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight  /{C because } the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day, they know all the procedures,  /they know what's good and what isn't,  /they'd be able to say, I'm sorry,  /you can't use this as, {F uh, } evidence, {D you know, } because it was either illegally obtained or whatever  /{C and, } {D you know, } you wouldn't have this, {F uh, } {F uh, } theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it [ to the, + to the ] jury  /{C and then } the judge says, {F oh, } no,  /[ d-, + disregard ] that.  /Come on,  /any jury's not going to  disregard the evidence, {D you know } <laughter>. /
That may very well be. /
{F Uh, } /
Yeah. /
That's true.  /((You d-)), -/
{D Well, }
How would you go about changing it? /
<Laughter>.
Leave the details up to somebody else, {F huh. } /
Yeah. /
