You should look at all of the point on the template not just the last one, the template also says the image belonging to the republic of macedonia is in the public domain if it being used for \"information purposes\". 
Yes, that's good. Revathy's page looked very reliable, that's why we used that as a source. 
I don't think there are many such official reliable sites left yet. The problem is most \"official sites\" are not really official, and often based on Wikipedia itself, and you don't know what to believe and what not. We used Madras Talkies' page, which is dead now. [http:\/\/kavithalayaa.com\/ Kavithalayaa]'s site is there, also AVM Production's site might be useful perhaps, but I can't enter that. Generally official sites of production houses seem to be very reliable ones. 
You closed [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion\/J. Kevin Tumlinson]] after one day without mentioning anything about speedy deletion or giving reasons. Not that I'm objecting ''too'' much, but did you realize it was only one day? --
No, no, I was the nominator! Just wanted to make sure it wasn't done in error. --
Hello Dana, thanks for contribute in this [[Template:Spanish horses|template]], but i need tell you that is about horse, and balearic article is about a language of a people, if you think that im not right please tell me for not fixing the edit at last. Enjoy your day ;)--
Hey, who said so? Frankly, I have absolutely no idea, sorry! 
H  Dana, totally  amiss of me - belated congrats for  your promotion! I  voted for  you  without  any  hesitation. I'm  pleased to  hear from  Pike  that  you  might  be reviewing  the Finnhorse, I  can't  think  of anyone better for  the job. --
Hi. Just writing that you closed out the [[WP:CFD]] as a '''merge and delete''', but category appears open still at this moment. Yours, 
Well, no website is 100% perfect, you got to understand that. Are you saying TOI is an unreliable source? Mention of Shankar as Shankar Mahadevan might have been a mistake, I'll contact them and ask them to correct it. What else do you want me to do? 
Could you restore Category:Second wave synthpop acts (or at least the bands formerly listed therein) to my userspace? I was checking out some of the bands and bookmarked it to check out some others later, but found that it was deleted. Thanks! 
Found them. Thanks for your help! 
Ok! Ty for the info and links. Will create new design asap. 
Well, I have not made much significant contribution but just a couple of sections in one or two articles. If that is not enough, I have removed the template if that bothers you. 
Thanks. I understand that there is a lot of controversy here, even between respected scholars. We need to document that disagreement in our articles, hopefully without attacking editors. --
You must have misunderstood something? I was commenting on your contributions, not on you as a person (please read the Ad Hominem article before you quote it). Also 'insinuations' are statements that cannot be proven, whereas my statements above can be proven by anyone who will take the time to look through your contrib history. have a great day 
You are talking about the distant past. I retracted the unfortunate comments and they were accepted, including by you, at the end of this section http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Talk:Ilinden-Preobrazhenie_Uprising#Search_engines_tests . I do not intend to personally attack you at all, but I will attack your contributions and 'content' every time you try to 'slightly' swing the pendulum to your side - you will be reported. 
That was a misinformed suggestion by another ordinary user, just like you and me. I still maintain that there were no personal attacks in my words, but only good humored jibs. The statement about the exclusivity of your activity on Macedonia related articles stands and is easily verifiable. I suggest if you have something more to say, to do it on my talk page as there is no point continuing this tirade on AnonEMouse's page who seems to have quite enough work without it. -cheers 
Misinformed\/misguided are not insults in the English language. Maybe brush up on your English or use [[Websters]]? :) 
Glad that you got my point. Actually Sreekarakkineni, Niranjaniyengar and this IP seems like the same person. Will file a case soon.--
Hi there Dana, when relisting CFD discussions, please be aware that we don't remove the discussions from one log date to the other; instead, we close the discussion at add the {{tl|Relisted}} template instead. As such, [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion\/Log\/2010_September_26&diff=389785157&oldid=389782135 this] edit should be reverted and the discussions should be closed. This is explained at [[WP:RELIST]], last line. Thanks. \u2014 
And just one other note, Dana\u2014after you relist a CFD, don't forget to change the date on the cfd tag on the category itself so that it goes to the new discussion, like [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Category%3AChristmas_number-one_singles_in_the_United_Kingdom&action=historysubmit&diff=389999136&oldid=387262711 this]. Thanks for you service in working on closing CFDs; we are always looking for more help and attention with these. 
Let me know how that goes.  Being able to format footnotes is a big plus, and like I said it's pretty easy once you've done it a few times.  I suggest that you try doing a few on your user page, or on a sub-page of your user page, for practice.  If you want more help just let me know. <font face=\"cursive\">\u2014 
I dropped notes to half a dozen editors on various articles already in the FARC stage. We'll see if it gets us anywhere. 
My apologies when I come trampling through your pet projects-- further from my mind to annoy you, seriously.  However, I keep seeing (esp. in [[jazz]] related articles) people interchanging sections listed as \"References\", \"Notes\", \"Footnotes\" \"External links\", and I've even seen (whilst editing) a \"Reflist 2\". Frankly, I'm baffled. I've pretty much stuck to the editing of [[musician]]s and generally, the articles are [[biography|biographical]] and I stick to the typical lead per [[WP:MOS]] (which I admit I never really read too deeply). Usually, at the end of an  article, there's the [[discography]] and the <nowiki>references section, followed by External links<\/nowiki> and often the latter is jam-packed with link farms that are longer than the article themselves. Can you explain to me how this works, with the Notes and all? OH, and feel free to revert my edits when they are done improperly. Sorry about messing up articles that I only want to help! --
OK, I'll have a look at it. Partly, one reason why I'm not a first class editor has some to do with [[ADD]] (or laziness, take your pick) which explains my difficulty with [[punctuation]] as well.. anyway, like I said, never feel bad about reverting my work, too. --

As far as the [[Scott Gorham]] article, that's just a classic case of an article that doesn't have enough references.  But it looks like someone has added more references since you posted about it here on my talk page.  I might add a few more myself if I get around to it.  In general, I'd say don't get too hung up about the technical details of naming the sections, or the best way to format references.  The most important things are to expand and improve the text of existing articles, and to add reliable references that you find, either on the internet or offline.  I happen to be interested in a lot of the technical details myself, as I've explained a bit here on my talk page, but if you find it confusing, don't worry about it.  The content is the most important thing, someone can always come along later and fix the formatting.  \"P.S.\" Looks like your buddy made admin, congratulations to him (or her). <font face=\"cursive\">\u2014 
AnonEMouse, when you get a chance could you take a look at the material Jamesd1 has added to the article? My view is that much of it is nothing but original research....for instance, the section comparing Bailey's writing to Theosophical Society literature which is based on nothing but Bailey quotes and links that do not even mention Bailey, all held together by original research of Jamesd1. If you think I am wrong, I will not bother the others editors on this point. (thanks for making the spelling correction) 
How can the FAR notice be removed from [[chess]]?  I commented it out on the talk page, but it stills says \"review\" on the article page.  
It doesn't look like we're getting much feedback on splitting the \"Gun laws in the United States (by state)\" article.  I posted notices on [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Law|WikiProject Law]] and [[Wikipedia:WikiProject United States|WikiProject United States]], to no avail.--
Hi. :) I appreciate all your work in that article and particularly in your diplomatic resolution to the nationality question. Mr. Cage would like us to set the record straight, and he's provided us with a published source so that we can. I've added that his nationality is American. (It's kind an irritable blog entry, but it contains some other biographical information that you might like to incorporate: [http:\/\/www.roadcage.com\/?p=60].) I just wanted to ask you, if you happen to be continuing to maintain the article as you so ably have in the past, to kind of keep an eye out for the return of Canadianism, if it should show up. Mr. Cage vigorously contests its accuracy. --
Dana, [[Wikipedia talk:Featured article review\/World Science Festival\/archive1|this was an incorrect (bad) hack]] that occurred at FAR and only came to my attention because an error was made in the ''Signpost'', indicating the FA had been delisted.[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost\/2010-10-18\/Features_and_admins&diff=prev&oldid=391348494]  When I went to check, I found that 2009 content had simply been deleted,[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=World_Science_Festival,_2008&diff=386458978&oldid=386458738] and the main article (notable) had gone away via a redirect to a [[World Science Festival, 2008|2008 article]].  I have done a partial cleanup, but more work is likely needed-- specifically, I don't know what else may have been deleted during the FAR, and what improvements from the 2008 version need to be restored to the main article.  I will leave a note for {{user|Dank}} and direct him to this conversation. The main article will need review to restore any changes made since 2008.  Someone else may want to update the main article to include 2010 and 2011, which are mentioned in the Festival website.  There are also dead links at the 2008 article that should have been picked up on the FAR.  
I dunno-- I may have confused myself between the two versions, but I think it's all up to snuff now!  Thanks!  I was surprised by that FAR :)  
I missed that discussion, but I definitely think it would be very good if the default width of the template was 24.2, so that it would be (I think) the same width as the infobox.  (And as an additional point, I would also favor making \"state=plain\" the default.)  <font face=\"cursive\">\u2014 
I was wondering if the widths of the infobox and the album ratings template would vary by browser and\/or by skin, but I didn't try to figure that out.  It sounds like they do.  But I think that using 24.2em would make them the same width for most readers, so I would still favor that.  As for \"state\", that's explained on the [[:Template:Album ratings]] page.  In my opinion \"state=plain\" would be the best default, because it displays the ratings without the options to hide or show them.  In most cases having the option is an unnecessary complication, in my view. <font face=\"cursive\">\u2014 
Thanks for your edits to this article. The thing is, though, they didn't play the Australia national cricket team; they played the Australians. Apologies if you already knew this, but there's a rigid distinction in operation here: \"Australia\" as such ''only'' play international cricket; all matches against counties, universities and so on are listed as \"Australians\". Ditto with other countries, so that (for example) \"Worcestershire v Pakistanis\" doesn't mean any old Pakistanis, but always the national team playing a non-international match. For that reason I'm inclined to change those edits back, but I'll leave it a day or two in case you want to come back at me. 
Thanks for the explanation Loganberry. I didn't know about that distinction. I'll change it back. 
New photo added by a drive-by to [[Marwari horse]]. Nice image, superficial image check suggests licensing is OK, but it's your article, so may want to peek.  It was in a bad spot, so I moved it, but not sure I improved matters.  
Allright, licensing fixed. All good now - it's a nice image. 
Took a quick peek at this.  May be a good idea to review [[List of horse breeds]] and [[Iberian horse]] to see if we already have articles (under a different spelling) for some of the breeds currently redlinked in the template.  Also not sure if we really need a nav template for this group -- WPEQ is a bit template heavy already... and I'd dread to see separate German, Italian, English and (god fobid!) USA templates, especially if we got fights going over which country claims which breed (like we have at Lipizzan!)...  The Italian, Japanese, and Indonesian horse breed articles just have extensive see also sections that cross-ref the others, or, if the Spanish horse list is too huge for a see also, we could expand [[Iberian horse]] into a list something along the lines of [[stock horse]] or [[gaited horse]].  Just a thought, and should this whole thread go over to WPEQ for more folks to discuss?  
Don't worry about it. I doubt many email harvesters will go digging in page histories, and don't know of any downstream sites that copy our histories, just our pages. Removing it from the page should be sufficient. --
I've responded at Good Olfactory's page to keep this all in one spot. 
I received your 2 emails. I'm not sure I understood the second, but if it's taken care of, that's good too. :-) --
I left a warning on their talk page. Looks like others have already removed the offensive comment. 
I see a similar address made a similar comment. [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Republic_of_Macedonia&diff=157578888&oldid=157499660] If it becomes a regular thing, tell me, and I will semi-protect the article talk page. That will stop all IP addresses without an account from editing there (apparently some do make non-abusive comments[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Republic_of_Macedonia&diff=156689101&oldid=156496906]) but if we have to, we will. --
Hi Smokey! Thanks for the nice note! LOL, I guess I'm more used to FAR closures, where closing notes go at the bottom. Feel free to move the comment if you would like. 
Will do. When I closed Dorset it wasn't exactly 14 days for those. I'll get to them tomorrow morning (it's getting to be bedtime here!) Have you had a chance to check out the two I pinged you about? 
You have the right idea; we certainly want confirmation before accusing someone of being an escort, which is usually a euphemism for being a prostitute. However, in this case, he's apparently a prizewinning escort. (Yes, I didn't know there was a prize for that either, but it seems there is ... live and learn. I'll be making an article for the [[International Escort Awards]] soon; it got coverage from the ''[[Village Voice]]'', ''[[DNA Magazine]]'', and even a bit from the ''[[New York Daily News]]''.) Winning the prize is fairly clear confirmation that he does work as an escort. --
Thanks for your feedback on the above. I wonder if you could give a tip on what is needed in\/which direction could be taken regarding the LEAD. It does seem to present a good synopsisof the what is covered in article w\/o going into details later discussed. Is it the prose? Is it the info? Is it the order? Not sure, and don't wanna go messin' w\/o a focus. Thanks 
Regarding [[:Image:Arpad Miklos cropped.jpg]] on the above article, do you know if there was an OTRS ticket for images from hisxpress.com? I've seen several images from there, supposedly under GFDL, and remember the issue coming up at [[WP:PUI]] quite a while ago. But I can't find the source for the permission, and it's not copyleft on the source so far as I can tell. I'll start asking around with the uploaders if you don't know, but thought I would check with the all-knowing Renaissance Mouse first. If we do have a ticket the images should probably be moved out to the Commons. 
Thanks for finding that. Oh, I remember Chidom. He came in when [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Pornography]] was sadly lacking a dedicated gay pornography editor, and did a very good job for a while. If it's an issue of editor creditability, that should be good enough; but I don't know it it is, we may well need the full email with headers, etc., archived at OTRS. --
Aaah. Hold on a bit, let me dig ... --
OK, I'll try to contact someone at New Millennium Video. If we can't get the permission confimed, the images may need to go. And [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Special:Linksearch&target=%2A.hisxpress.com&namespace=&limit=500&offset=0 there are quite a few of them]. 
Hey guys, what an issue. I do not think that is going to be sufficient since there is not a permission for rights. I ran into this with another image and lost the battle some time ago. 
I'd wait. I'm willing to believe Chidom actually got the permission email he wote he did, partly because of [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith]], but mostly because he really was a dedicated editor. He may have already forwarded it to permissions at wikimedia dot org the same way most of the other emails on that page Videmus Omnia found were forwarded. If he didn't, he may still have it around, and may respond to my email to forward it there now, so we can get an OTRS ticket number that way. If not, HisXPress is likely to confirm giving the permission, and we can forward that to OTRS. Between all those possibilities, I think it most likely the image permission is fine, let's give it a couple of weeks. --
Take a look at [[User:AnonEMouse\/MouSearch]]. I made a [[Google Co-op]] customized [[search engine]] to help searching for sources as opposed to endless image galleries and  forums. Maybe that will help somewhat. It doesn't include as many gay sources as it might, mostly because I don't know as much about that area, but there is no reason that can't be improved. --
You guys are much too good to me! I hope after this experience kills me you guys will be pall barriers! And AnonEMouse can give my eulogy so that it is well referenced! You can do the powerpoint so that the images are well protected LOL 
Wow, the article looks grate, uh, I mean great!  I'll feel free to make any minor (or even not so minor) adjustments, but in general everything looks to be \"just exactly perfect\", as Bobby might say.  Thank you very much for doing this.  I'd encourage you to keep up the good work. <font face=\"cursive\">\u2014 
The track listing for ''Europe '72: The Complete Recordings'' is indeed a daunting prospect.  We'll have to wait and see what happens with that.  I haven't ordered a copy either, by the way.  Anyway, thanks again for your recent (and future) work on Grateful Dead album, and related, articles. <font face=\"cursive\">\u2014 
Allright, thanks for letting me know. I've added it to the list for the bot to empty and delete It should be gone within the next day or two at the latest. 
With all due respect, 4 minutes was probably too long.  There was nothing you could do to resolve the issue of the copyright tag.  It is against copyright laws for Wikipedia to host images that are not properly license, let alone images that bear a different license than the one the copyright holder placed on his image.  Any image that is a violation of copyright law should be immediately deleted from Wikipedia.  It is not a question of letting the uploader fix something, the expectation is that it should be properly licensed at the time of uploading, not a couple years after.  Another fact is that the photo in question ''cannot'' be used on Wikipedia with the license it has.  If it was simply a question of what the proper license is, and the image was free to host on Wikipedia, than of course I wouldn't have deleted the image, I would've just fixed it.  In the future, if you don't want your photos to be deleted, make sure that the photos can be used on Wikipedia, and make sure that you mark said photo with the correct license.

Good find! I don't mind helping to review and tag some of them, though gay porn is not really my thing (as you can probably tell from the images I usually get). And I don't know if I want to have those pics in my Commons upload log. :) 
I looked at {{tl|OTRS ticket}} and it seems to need some sort of ticket id, as well as the ticket number. I asked permissions for that, and for clarification on how we are to determine \"actual copyright holder\" other than HisXPress. Let's see what they have to say. --
OK, I started on the images. (The Miklos image was one that I did.) Before moving out to Commons, the descriptions have to be fixed and the OTRS ticket number added. I'm listing the ones with other copyright holders at [[WP:PUI]] for probable deletion, as they're [[WP:NFCC#1]] vios if they're not under free license. I'll keep working but would appreciate some help. The ticket number should probably be added in a note somewhere at [[WP:P*]] in case someone wants to use other images from that site.

Salamat po. 
There is never any reason to close an AFD before the week has ended, unless the nomination is withdrawn and there is no one that says delete or the nominator was a sockpuppet or someone just being pointy.  The article [[Lady]] will most certainly end in Keep, but there is no reason not to give everyone time to speak their mind, no matter how ridiculous their cases may be.  On the other side of the coin, snow deletes never have any possible justification for being done at all.  I've seen nominations start off with a dozen people spamming delete, only to have more rational minded people, who take at least a brief moment to click on the Google news search at the top of the AFD, state valid reasons to keep and add in references. 
Did you mean unanimously? 
Yeah, I guess I did Tim. Wolfkeeper, that wasn't contested at all. I don't know what you are thinking of but that was clearly going for a keep vote. 
The AfD was re-closed, again under SNOW, by an administrator about an hour later.  '''

I reverted my [[WP:P*]] note, and probably need to add clarification to the Successful requests. In a way, I'm glad Chidom isn't here any more, he would probably be tearing his hair out. :-(. --
OK, I added a note to the permissions page, referencing your post here, and all the images I could find have been nominated for deletion [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Images_and_media_for_deletion\/2007_September_15#Images_from_hisxpress.com here]. 
Jeez. Well, at least I know it was well written if The Horse is stealing it. There are a couple of pieces from the summary of that documentary that I'll probably add in, just little factoids. I wonder if they're going to release it on DVD - might be a good x-mas present to ask for. 
Thank you for comments on [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment\/Epbr123|the RFC]]. I know I can sometimes be rude to other users and I intend to fix this, but do you think the nominations I have been making are inappropriate? I'd like to know so I can adjust my behavior, and your's is the only outside opinion I really trust on this. I do feel the List of big-bust models article is a mess, but I'll stay away from it due to the trouble it causes. 
Anyway, that's the general answer. The specific answer, I guess, is to nominate fewer \"bunches\", when you can, try to improve them rather than delete them, and be nicer to people in general. Sorry for being incoherent, hope that helped a bit. -
I've added sources for the reintro fact and also listed it as an option. Cna't find another that mentions the elk record.

Hey Dana, Congrats on Trait du Nord and just a nudge to add your new GAs to the portal -- I'm sort of distracted by other things right now (Why do wiki-crises alway hit when my work life is also a mess?).  
Sorry if I am snarky today.  Didn't realize what a foul mood I was in until I started editing.  I think my edits\/comments were essentially legit, but my tone was snarky and I didn't intend it as such.  So sorry if I sounded a little mean.  You took a wonderful photo for the Appy article, by the way, and a wonderful-looking horse.  And yeah, nothing like the challenge for the next six months of getting photos of wooly mammoths that whinny... !  
He's got a nice Arab-ish profile, so of course he's beautiful!!! I'd ride my horse, but it's dark now! (Could the overall wiki-malaise I've noticed around here have any correlation to the end of daylight savings time, I wonder?)  The hot chocolate sounds like a yummy idea though...ummmmm.  
That's the first three, if they're representative, I see the pattern. In general the sources are fine. Some can be improved, but it shouldn't be hard, I found the BDM with a basic search. May I suggest working together with him to improve the sources? --
Whoo. Tall order - check all 77 references? I checked three above, the first two were OK, the third could be improved, but wasn't absolutely horrible. Tell you what; ask me about the ones that you feel least certain about, and I'll try to help, but man, 77 is a lot. --

Dana, in case you haven't heard already. i see smallman messaged you above noting that they were almost finished. it looks like they've got all the listings back up and running. here's the featured one by cleanup category count: http:\/\/toolserver.org\/~svick\/CleanupListing\/CleanupListing.php?project=Featured_articles&sort=Count 
bloody hell you're a speed demon! you already dropping notes on the articles needing cleanup, takes the weight off everyone else. from svick's talkpage it looks like they're going to get the bot running again, to post listings on wikipedia pages, which should hopefully allow us to keep track of progress like before. i'll look out for that or give us a shout if you see developments,

They introduced the topic of channeling, not me. It is not necessary to discuss Alice Bailey, but if the subject is introduced, and emphasised, discussion is justified. Why don't they just take out all the mention of how the books were written, and just discuss what was written? It is unnecessary to the article. The analogy to mystics does not apply, because few mystics were channelers. Many religious traditions forbid it, so channeled literature is almost never found in the writing Jewish or Christian mystics.
