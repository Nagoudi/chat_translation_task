Yes I agree. The law permits usage of documents, photographs and other materials for educational and informational purposes. There was a normative act issued by the government of the Republic of Macedonia that even allowed citizens to make photocopies or photograph rare archive materials. 
Nagma'a site, at least that filmography page, looks like taken from Wikipedia itself. I didn't remove it from time being, but I don't think it's true. 
Most of the so called \"official sites\" are maintained by fans or cinema based web companies. Not sure how reliable are they. <span style=\"color:green;font-size:small;;font-family:Segoe Print;\">-<i>B<\/i>iLLa-<\/span>
Well, notability cannot be acquired in 4 days. That was my reasoning behind the early closure. However, if you still believe the closure was out of process, you can still refer to the deletion review. - 
I was a bit surprised because i know you were the nominator ;) No, it wasn't done in error. - 
My apologies, I forgot to include the disambiguator. Please check now - it should be right. Thanks for letting me know. 
Maybe, we should check out who added that, it could be some fanatic IP user. There will have been nominees, since there were nominees in earlier ceremonies and in the Telugu section, too, but how to find out? If there was a video coverage of that ceremony available we would know. Otherwise, I would remove it as it's unsourced. 
Thank you very much! I am going to try to take a look over Finnhorse - actually, I think I'll go start looking at it right now while I have a few minutes. 
Yes, I know. It's on the list at [[Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion\/Working]], and the bot should get to it shortly. 
I don't care. This is not the place to elevate your favourite Star's films. I'm not questioning about the credibility of TOI. There is a consensus not to add budget\/gross figures for any Indian movie, if it's speculated at a higher rate. I think you might be aware of the \"Enthiran issue\". Even official sources were not considered. --
There would be nothing to restore, and categories can't be moved even if there were.  Category pages contain nothing, articles are added to it by an addition of code at the bottom of each article.  When a category is deleted, CFD has an Adminbot that goes through each article and removes the category.  The best you could do would be to find the edits in [[User:Cydebot]]'s contribution record, and then you'd be able to see what was in the category pre-deletion. 
I agree i copied, even he mi8 know it very well. I dont know 2 design and all but some thing inside, i got my own work also. If u dont mind can i copy abit of urs. Even ur page looks good!! 
I don't understand what you are saying. Could you please be more precise? 
If you look at the contrib history of Mr. Neutron you will find plenty of edits like this, and all of his 'contribs' are EXCLUSIVELY on articles dealing with Macedonia, and mostly pushing pro-bulgarian POV in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. I just thought you might want to know for future reference :) 
Capricornis, stop insinuating. And please refrain from various [[Ad hominem]] arguments, as they are falacies. Comment on contributions please. 
You were already warned on your talkpage not to commit any more personal attacks, so dont do it. You have been consistently insinuating against other Wikipedia contributors and this is not at all nice going. 
Oh please! \"Distant past\" was only [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=User_talk:Capricornis&diff=156856515&oldid=156665242 yesterday]. Report whatever you want, with such consistent agenda against other contributors you only bring suspicion on yourself. 
And more personal attacks calling people misinformed... 
Hi. I think your statement of the ip being the sockpuppet of sreekar akkineni is true. Earlier, a user named Niranjaniyengar(who was a sock of sreekar akkineni) wrote on my talk page in a similar manner. If you can trace the ip used by them, it would be possible to block him. I also have a doubt if Mr. Kollyfan, famed for his discussion of the Enthiran gross has something to do with this. It would throw some light on this manner. Thanks! 
So put in a sock puppet investigation to find out. 
Whoops, my apologies. I apparently read the bolded part and completely missed the part in parentheses. Thanks for letting me know - please let me know if there is anything else I'm doing wrong: I'm new at it, but the backlog needs work so I wanted to chip in. I'll go fix that now. 
Hey! Hi -There are a bunch of things I want to learn here in [[Wikipedia]]. Only you, and maybe 3 others could teach me (terribly embarrassing to admit I'm so ignorant with computers, etc.) and so I've decided to send a couple notes and the others for help. Is it OK to email you, to save space on our talk pages? Mine is activated too. This drives me crazy! One burning question has to do with many [[Grateful Dead]]-related articles, so I am here. Nearly all the biography articles about [[musician]]s eventually have a Discography section, followed by References, and then External links. Some of them have a \"see also\" section which is essentially [[trivia]], and it is simple enough to see if it's warranted or not. However, what I don't understand is a \"Notes\" section. What purpose, exactly does it serve, and how do you put info into the text properly to acheive whatever result the editor is trying to accomplish? It's really perplexing. --
I think you should nag MF. He never responds to my nags :P '''
Outofsinc on British Empire is a sock\/meat, quite obviously '''
Thanks for the note.  Yes, I think a lot of editors are a bit confused about Notes, References, and External links sections.  Take a look at what I wrote at [[User talk:Mudwater#Notes and other things]], and at [[Talk:Skip Battin#Place references here]], for some helpful info.  On some articles, most or all of the External links section should really be in the References section.  But it's important not to remove reliable references from articles.  Feel free to reply here if you want to talk about this some more.  <font face=\"cursive\">\u2014 
Can you please see [[Wikipedia talk:Featured article review\/Simon Byrne\/archive1#Breaking_up_other_users'_posts]], and help out with regard to this disruption? Thank you for your time, -- '''

Second, last but not least, There's an '''Rfa''' for [[User:Catfish Jim and the soapdish]], one of the handful of editors who, like you, have consistently been a help and inspiration. I hope you'll take a look: [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship\/Catfish Jim and the soapdish]] Please, vote with your heart. Thanks as always. --
Thanks for the response. OK, then. The editor who just brought [[Thin Lizzy]] to GA status becomes more motivated with the Thin Lizzy related articles (like [[Scott Gorham]]) when I bring in new photos that are good. If there isn't enough text to place the article, it doesn't work, and he's good that way.. like the photo for [[Bo Diddley]] and [[Eric Bell]].. so that must be him. Oh, and as for [[User:Catfish Jim and the soapdish]]'s Rfa, it is good! I was really surprised to hear he jumped into the ring of fire without my knowing he planned to do it.. he said he didn't want to look like he might be fishing for votes, which just goes to show what a decent guy he is.. not to mention all those positive votes, and I think, 2 votes not for his Adminship, which is a really decent outcome! I thought you knew him already. You may benefit from doing so. He's been so helpful to me over the last year or so, and is a good editor as well as good at sniffing out vandalism, which is why he finally asked for the mop-- more tools in which to deal with those problems. I'm glad for him! I'll only vote in an Rfa if I ''really'' know the individual, so it's just been three times altogether. --
As an editing rule here, it's better to add to people's edits, rephrase, rearrange, etc., rather than remove their changes wholesale. That way there is some back and forth, but in general a kind of incremental progress, and the article improves. Just reverting leads to deadlock, and should be avoided. Don't insist on perfection all at once. When you find something wrong, fix it, but don't just delete it unless there really is no other choice. --
The bot will come through and close the review in a while (the schedule tends to be Wednesday and Saturday nights, but this varies sometimes). I'm going to uncomment the tag on the talk page so that it doesn't screw up the bot. 
I agree, not much feedback so far.  Seven editors have commented, including you and me.  And one of the seven also posted about it on [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Firearms|WikiProject Firearms]]. <font face=\"cursive\">\u2014 
Wow, this is great.  And I love Mr. Cage's explanation of his situation, and his views on the Wikipedia process from the perspective of being the subject of an article.  Thanks very much for your help with this!  <font face=\"cursive\">\u2014 
You are correct that the main WSF article should exist and include information from all of the years. However, all of the reviewers (including Malleus!) agreed that the WSF 2008 article met FA standards. Most of the dead link tags were invalid - I've removed those and fixed the couple of valid ones. Easy enough. The 2009 info was the only stuff deleted (AFAIK) during the FAR, but I'm not sure what you mean by the \"improvements from the 2008 version need to be restored to the main article\". 
Hey, I noticed [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Garcia_(album)&diff=prev&oldid=434347681 this] yesterday and was wondering if the 24.2ems should be made part of the actual template. There was a discussion on this a short while ago on the template's talk page, but I didn't think it was possible. Didn't occur to me to try decimals. \u2013&nbsp;<font color=\"#06266f\">Ker\u03b1u<\/font><font color=\"#1240AB\">no\u03c2co<\/font><font color=\"#4671DS\">pia<\/font><font color=\"#A60000\"><sup>\u25c1<\/sup><\/font><i><sub><font color=\"#5E1FFF\">
I'm not familiar enough with the states thing, but here's the discussion: [[Template_talk:Album_ratings#Width]]. It's not very old at all. I would support the 24.2. \u2013&nbsp;<font color=\"#06266f\">Ker\u03b1u<\/font><font color=\"#1240AB\">no\u03c2co<\/font><font color=\"#4671DS\">pia<\/font><font color=\"#A60000\"><sup>\u25c1<\/sup><\/font><i><sub><font color=\"#5E1FFF\">
Oh, I remember states now. Yeah, not sure why one would collapse the template at all. Kind of a silly option. Well, when I messed around with ems, they varied between skins (I tried Vector, and I always use Modern, otherwise), and I'm using Safari for a browser, and your 24.2 thing looked fine on Safari\/skin=Modern, so I assume you've figured out the secret width needed. Not sure how well it would work, but you could always put an infobox and the album ratings template on an otherwise-empty sandbox, then throw that URL into [http:\/\/browsershots.org\/ browsershots.org] and see if the widths vary from browser to browser. They'd all be in Vector (default) skin, I think. \u2013&nbsp;<font color=\"#06266f\">Ker\u03b1u<\/font><font color=\"#1240AB\">no\u03c2co<\/font><font color=\"#4671DS\">pia<\/font><font color=\"#A60000\"><sup>\u25c1<\/sup><\/font><i><sub><font color=\"#5E1FFF\">
To answer the obvious question, where there is no convenient adjectival form, one just adds \"XI\" to the team name, so that you have \"Barbados v England XI\" or whatever. For historical reasons, until the 1970s, England played as \"MCC\" in non-international tour games. 
Thanks. As with most things cricket, the logic isn't perfect (eg theEngland matches against the Australian Forces in 1945 ''are'' \"England\", not \"England XI\") but it's usually reliable otherwise. 
Licensing isn't quite right. I've dropped a note on the editor's talk; won't remove the image for now, but if it's not cleared up shortly it'll need to go.

What is the policy when someone writes something like [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Talk:Republic_of_Macedonia&diff=157152659&oldid=156689101 this] ? Does their IP get banned and their comment purged from the talk page? 
They would be [[Wikipedia:blocking policy|blocked]], yes, but it looks like they haven't been repeating. [[IP address]]es are usually not [[Wikipedia:Banning policy|banned]], because an IP is usually just a number handed out by a service provider, and will be given to a different person  eventually; certainly when the person signs up with a new service provider, and sometimes even faster than that. Our acquaintaince from Perth editing on that subject has shown the ability to get a new IP number within minutes of the old one being blocked, sometimes several times a day; fortunately, however, this isn't him. --
Hi Dana.  Thanks for closing [[Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion\/Log\/2010_October_14#Category:Wikipedians_open_to_whale_squishing]].  That was a decent close.  I might have said \"no consensus for deviating from policy-based arguments\" instead of mentioning IAR.  You put your closing note at the bottom of the debate.  That is a bit unusual.  Usually, the closing explanation goes at the top, with the close, doesn't it?  --
I think you should close the first one too, as I gave it as an example of a bad FA a few times '''
Hello, I did an edit on one of the porn stars pages and I have an editor who just joined [[wikipedia]] who is going onto the article and adding things at random. I removed the personal info like where he lives and the editor put it right back on. Then the editor made an edit and place a description as this [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Arpad_Miklos&diff=prev&oldid=157524752]. COuld you please look at this? I did go onto theri talk page and explain about putting personal info and advertisement onto an article. I hope it helps. Thank you 
I had no idea! I just reverted the edit because he stated that the subject was a close friend and wanted the info on the page. As you and I both know, there has to be more to the verification than just saying \"The subject wants the info included\" That is why I made the edit and then went to his talk page to advise him that we would need sourcing for that if he wanted the info to remain. I had no idea! LOL Well if I ever need another job, now I know where I can get one and get an award for doing it! LOL Thanks man 
I've responded on the review page, and have that page watchlisted. Thanks for your work on the article! 
Looks like the permission is [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wikipedia:Successful_requests_for_permission#Images_from_www.HisXpress.com here]. I don't know if this is good enough for us anymore - especially since the signature is by {{user|Chidom}}, who is a user that doesn't exist!

I had an email address for him once, but he hasn't responded for a while. I'll send him a note about it, but can't guarantee anything. --
Do you think we should remove it until we get such permission? I think I would feel better about it that way. 
I am down with that program! Sorry I have stirred this ant hill! But we need to get it right so that it will be easier for other editors in the future. I just hope that you guys don't think I am just being Rambo and busting through these articles. I really am doing research to find cites and sources. There are very few legit sources except for the subjects webpages or escort sites. Very frustrating! 
Oooooh, very nice. 

Thanks for the upbeat feedback. Clearly, a propensity for details is paramount in this arena, and thus the overall appeal to me. I will continue to make edits to various articles (e.g., I've done some work on a few BLP's and extensive research on [[Festival Express]], et. al.) as my schedule permits. I look forward to ''Road Trips Volume 4 Number 5'', to be released in November, 2011. However, considering I wasn't one of the original fortunate 7200 who laid out the requisite $450, I will leave the 73 CD ''[[Europe '72: The Complete Recordings]]'' work to you and others! I definitely don't relish that monumental setlist enumeration chore. As an aside, though, I was wondering about the idea of a template to make to additional of future albums somewhat more streamlined. Might be a worthwhile mini-project to construct in a sandbox? Cheers!

I am not questioning whether or not you uploaded the image in good faith or not, it is obvious that you did.  I have a FLickr account and understand people change their license on photos all the time.  But if there is no proof that the image was licensed under said license, that we have to assume that the license that is accessible (i.e. the most current) is the license the image is and has always been under.  If you can show me proof that the said image was under the license that you put on the image when it was uploaded, then I will gladly restore the image for you, but if there is no proof we must delete the image under our image policy.

No it's not true, but at least we know what you are now. 
Chidom replied; apparently hisxpress sent the permission to wikimedia directly, so they didn't send the number to Chidom, and he didn't know he was supposed to get a number. I wrote to permissions-en at wikimedia.org, and they wrote \"The correspondence was indeed forwarded to us, under ticket number 2006072610000589.\" They also wrote \"Please note that while the images are hosted on the hisxpress.com site, they may not be the actual copyright holders of all the works, and therefore may not be in a position to license the images further. It would be best if you could review each image on a case by case basis to determine the actual copyright holder and the validity of the GFDL licensing in this permission, instead of applying a boilerplate template to all of them.\" I'm not quite sure what that is supposed to mean. If the site claims they own the image, in general we need to take their word for it, unless we have evidence or at least claims to the contrary. But maybe it will become obvious if we look at some of the images and they have watermarks that say they are owned by someone other than HisXPress. I haven't looked at any beyond the Arpad Miklos image. --

Well when a user brought this up on IRC, we agreed unilaterally that it should be closed as a keep. Why should we prolong drama at an AFD when it would continue along the path towards a keep vote? There is no way that the AFD would've ended in delete unless fifty editors showed up and simultaneously voted the same way. When that happens on this site, it is called sockpuppetry and it would've been noticed. I stand by my decision to close it as I know that user planned to do the same but I beat him to it. 
I've undone the close. Exactly how stupid do you think we are to let a contested AFD close as a 'snow', about 4 days early, and exactly how stupid are you to do something like that in the middle of your RFA? That's a rhetorical question by the way, that means you don't need to answer that.- <small>
Very, probably, but not definitely. Snow keep isn't even a policy, but is an essay and it's meant to be used when there's basically absolutely no chance at all. Basically, if you do it, and ''anyone'' questions it even the proposer, you've fucked up.- <small>
\"''Anyway, who am I trying to convince? Hah hah!''\"  Care to explain?  
If you are not able to defend your comment, will you be man enough to retract it? 
As I said on the FAR page, just wait a week or so. If no one replies, you can readd the template to the talk page and retransclude the discussion to the FAR page. Also, a collaborative type of post is much more likely to get a good response; comments such as \"dusty, unedited excuse of a talk page\" are unnecessary. 
The good news for this particular image is that we have an editor claiming to be in touch with the article subject himself, so we can ask him if he would be willing to release a free image (hopefully clothed!). But it's pretty bad news for the other articles using HisXPress images. :-(. --

Yup, I know. I linked it at the top of the FAR talk page, to replace the old cleanup listing.

You mean [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Alice_Bailey&diff=157851672&oldid=157755144 this section]? I agree with the critics, whether the issue is original research or undue weight. The main problem is that this is the Alice Bailey article, and the section isn't about Alice Bailey, it's about [[Channeling]] in general. We have a whole article on that (it seems to be called [[Mediumship]]), and that section would be better directed there. We can't put a long section critical of channeling in general in the article on every mystic, any more than we can put a long section critical of warfare in general in every article on a general, or a long section critical of abortion in general in every article on a feminist.--
Oh, I'm not an expert, but in my feeble memory, lots of religions' prophets describe or are described as being possessed by the Holy Spirit, being in a trance, speaking in tongues, being visited by spirits, all of that stuff. Also, it doesn't seem the article focuses on channeling per se, rather the fruits thereof. It doesn't recommend that people go out and become channelers. It also mentions Bailey's suicide attempts, similarly we shouldn't stick in a whole section on how bad suicide is for you.--
Another reply.
