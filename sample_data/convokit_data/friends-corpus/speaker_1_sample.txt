There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?

Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.

Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
Instead of...?
Never had that dream.
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
Hi.
Are you okay, sweetie?
Cookie?
Ohh.
Thanks.
No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?
I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
Sorry.

I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
And I just want a million dollars!
Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Hi.
So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
I'll have whatever Christine is having.

Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
I'm all better now.
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!

It's, uh, it's Paul.
Who's Paul?
Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
Yes!
Rach, wait, I can cancel...
Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
Really?
What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?
Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
A wandering?
Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
Hey, Paul!
Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.
Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart. La-la-la-la-la- Thank you. La-la-la-la...ohhh!

It's a beautiful thing.
I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
I have no idea.
Done with the bookcase!
This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
You guys.
You got screwed.
Oh my God!
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
-leg?
You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
That's right.
I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
You must stop!
Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!
What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
Stay out of my freezer!
What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,
Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.

That is amazing.
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
Morning. Good morning.
Morning, Paul.
Hi, Paul, is it?
Thank you! Thank you so much!
No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.
Yeah. Thank you.
Shut up, and put my table back.
