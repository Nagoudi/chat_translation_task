I was just reading about the Princeton Mic-Check and it's getting [national press](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-29/princeton-brews-trouble-for-us-1-percenters-commentary-by-michael-lewis.html).

I want to get a sense of what people felt like around campus. Anything interesting happen? Anything interesting coming up?
i don't have a facebook, so we'd need a volunteer.. just someone to let cornell on facebook know that we have a presence on reddit.. perhaps a small explanation of what reddit is? now that we are almost beautiful and such.. we need more redditors!


i'm seriously considering cornell for law school, and this intrigues me. it's not at all a part of my decision making process, but the fact that cornell was at some point by some people known as "godless cornell" (i think i read that on wikipedia) makes me smile. 

it seems like most of the older schools in this country are religious and cornell is non-sectarian (i believe). 

how does this play out at the school?

edit: to be more clear, i guess i'm wondering if the student body is especially agnostic/atheist leaning or if there's some sort of unstated distaste for religion. 

i'm agnostic atheist FWIW.


What do you think of Cornell's big crackdown on drinking? 
Hey /r/Cornell!  I'll be in town interviewing for Johnson's MBA program over a weekend in January.  I've never been to Ithaca and would love to get some suggestions on what to see/do when I have a free moment.  Any suggestions on decent (but affordable hotels) close to campus, good restaurants, and good bits of sight seeing are more than welcome!  Thanks for the help!
Remember when Cornell published Median Grade Reports? Well they stopped after Fall 2010, but started putting median grades on our transcripts. Our plan is to create our own Median Grade Reports for Spring 2011 and Fall 2012 based on our transcripts, but we need your help. If everybody follows these steps, we can have full official Median Grade Reports by next week, maybe in time for Add/Drop.

**1)  Order your official transcript  Follow the steps from here** http://transcript.cornell.edu/
This takes 5 minutes, it’s completely free, and they’ll send your official transcript within 2 days

**2) Find your classes on these spreadsheets and enter the MEDIAN grades listed**

**Spring 2011**
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aj00i2xIYcOIdHp6cmdXRmwwLTVwS2c5Q295WmdXWGc

**Fall 2011**
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aj00i2xIYcOIdFBJc0NpcVJPRlRTOEVBOHhldkx1cVE

Use ctrl+f  (command+f on a mac) to find your class number
Keep your own grades private and help out the rest of the Cornell community
 
**3) Tell your friends to do the same thing.** The more people who fill in median grades, the more classes we’ll have median grades for, so spread the word

**4) Look at the median grades for classes you want to take**
 
Thanks a lot everyone for helping out. This is an easy thing to do where everyone benefits. These are the real median grades, and will give everybody more info before signing up for classes. When enough of it has been filled out, we’ll make it a downloadable PDF and put the link here. As an added bonus, once 80% of these classes are filled in, I’ll make the median grade reports from Spring 2009 – Fall 2010 available for download.

Edit: FB event link for easier sharing http://www.facebook.com/events/171881282911355/


I'm applying for a few jobs, hoping to get one in on-campus IT, a library, or in the bakery at Okenshields (I like baking) as a backup.

Has anyone worked these jobs who can give me their recommendation or insight?

Thanks


Please send me a DM or comment below with how I can get a hold of you.

Thanks so much!
Hey everyone! I know there's been a lot of "incoming freshman" questions on here lately, but I've got another one. I apologize in advance =P

I'm really interested in doing the outdoor odyssey thing, but I just wanted some tips/suggestions on which ones were fun (though I'm sure they're all good). Any advice you guys have before I register, or any personal experiences?

Thanks guys, go big red =)
Does anyone know if its working or not?


Hey, I know that this news has been posted in comments before, but I thought that it might help to have a dedicated post for it.

DC++ is back!  A hub is running under new management at the address ***cornell.ignorelist.com:4000***.  To connect, just go to your "Favorite Hubs" screen in the DC++ client, and edit the properties so the address field contains the address above.

It's just as secure as before--since only Cornell IPs are allowed on, outside organizations, such as the RIAA and MPAA, can't see what you upload and download.  Enjoy, and remember to share and reshare!

I still don't have a license (I'm from NYC, so I rely on subways a lot). I did a search, and a few bad reviews came up. Does anyone else have any experience with this school? $60 is a lot for just an hour of lessons, so I don't want to have to waste that much if they are as bad as everyone says they are...
Hi Guys!


I'm from Binghamton University, and I was hoping to see if I could crash with a Redditor up at Cornell for slope day! A bunch of friends are going up Thursday night, and are staying with their girlfriends and leaving Saturday morning(I don't have a place to stay :c). I was hoping to come up Thursday night via bus(if it's okay, if not I completely understand), take part in Slope Day activities and stay Friday night and leave in the morning. If you can just do Friday, that's fine too!

If anyone would be cool with this, I would love you forever! I really just need a couch or something something simple. Thanks so much! :D
Hey I'm a member of the class of 2017 and would like to know more about the engineering physics major and the mech e major. Also what are the differences between the two and what kinds of jobs do those with an engineering physics major get?
I was accepted to the ILR school for 2017. MY GPA for high school has been about a 3.7 unweighted and 5.3 Weighted (out of 6). I've taken every AP class at my school besides Physics and Music Theory (about 14 AP classes total) with mostly A's and a few scattered B's as well as a C in Freshman precalc a a C+ in AP calc sophomore year (math isn't my strong suit) 


However, Senior year has been a much bigger challenge for me. I've been encountering suicidal thoughts and intermittent depression since i was about 10 years old, but this year it got significantly worse. Towards the beginning of the year I ended up being diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder type II and mild psychosis.  Second semester was especially hard with lack of sleep from constant nightmares, losing school due to manic episodes, and even had a suicide attempt for which I was hospitalized for a week. I've been trying drug cocktail after drug cocktail and nothing seems to be working; my doctors say I may have to go in for longer term inpatient care (~1 month or more) at an institution and are even throwing around the idea of electroshock therapy (voluntary of course).


My Dad lost his job last August so our family went from making 60k/year to 13k/year. The financial shock has put incredible stress on me, i've had to take an array of minimum wage jobs to help pay for food (I live in Florida so we get jack shit from welfare). To top it all off, my parents are in the process of getting a divorce and my house is a constant fucking screaming mach 24/7, to the point that we have the cops called regularly on domestic dispute calls. (thanks, nosy neighbors)


My whole life is fucking falling apart around me and there's literally nothing I can do.


My grades have slipped. I'm taking 7 AP's and a dual-enrollment community college course, and chances are i might end up with three C's (maybe even a D+), and about an even number of B's and A's. 


Cornell is my dream school. I have the chance to go to my dream school for nearly a full ride, and I'm fucking terrified that I might get rescinded because my falling grades.


Please current Cornellians, I need your advice. Should I start talking to the admissions office now? Do you think I might get rescinded? PLEASE be honest. If there is a chance I might get rescinded, I need to start planning for a future without Cornell as soon as possible.


Thank you so much for hearing me out.



TL;DR incoming freshman, life is literally falling apart before my eyes, Senior year grades have slipped, do you think I might get rescinded?


PS throwaway account.
Yo, I'm a CS or ECE major (not decided which yet), and I was wondering how feasible it is to take a language class, learn that language well, and get a good grade in that class, whilst balancing other obligations of the curriculum.  I'm between Chinese (native-speaker, but completely illiterate) and Spanish (took in high school, I enjoy it); which of those would be more beneficial, or could I do both? Thanks!


Today I received a phone call from the Cornell College of Engineering telling me that I was accepted off the waitlist. I'm incredibly stoked, but the $60k price tag is a bit overwhelming. If I do accept the offer on the waitlist, what happens next? I have already sent in my SIR and housing fee application to UC Davis. I've read that I have to e-mail the admissions office at UCD telling them to withdraw my SIR or something of the sort. It would be a great help if any of you could give me some instructions.

Also, is the $60k price tag worth it at Cornell Engineering? (I'm a computer science major by the way). Thanks a bunch in advance, I'm seriously speechless right now.
I applied to Cornell for CS-Eng transfer and will hear back any time between next week and June.  So my question is, coming from Georgia Tech, whose campus is situated in the heart of Atlanta, is transferring worth it? With many classes possibly not transferring, and having to readjust, I'm having second thoughts.  Also, what can you tell me about the level of difficulty relative to GT?  Will it be significantly harder?  Just in case anyone's wondering ,one of the main reasons I want to transfer is because it's been my dream to work in NYC, and I feel a degree from Georgia Tech won't put me in an advantageous of a position as one from Cornell would.  Does that thought hold true?  Sorry for the rambling.  Thanks!


Hello Cornell students!

I have some brief questions for you. My fiancé and myself are looking to open up a business and we are wondering if Ithaca would be a good town to open up shop!

The questions are

Do you go to a coffee shop off campus? 
If there was a new coffee shop in town would you try it out?
Do you play any trading card games, board games or video games on a regular basis?
If there was a coffee shop that also routinely held various game nights and competitions would you frequent the establishment?

Thanks for your time - I really appreciate any answers I get!

EDIT:  Thank you to everyone for the thoughtful responses!  This is exactly what I was looking for!  We are still quite a ways away from being able to open our shop, but we aren't going to let our dream die!  We aren't 100% certain WHERE we are going to open shop yet, but I know that it WILL happen, someday (hopefully soon!)
Please see http://minus.com/pages/careers for more details and positions available.

To learn more about Minus, take a look at http://minus.com and http://minus.com/mobile

Cheers

Leaving today or tomorrow -- back on Mon or Tues.. Could be one or both ways. PM me if you're interested!





Good day CC members :D
I am an 18 years old student hoping to apply as a transfer student to CALS major in AEM in the near future but I am quite confused with the information on the official website. It says here http://cals.cornell.edu/admissions/apply/transfer/requirements/aem/ that "Strong preference will be given to candidates who will be transferring in the fall of their sophomore year. (Only in special circumstances will admission be offered to candidates transferring in the spring or in their junior year.)" but I don't think I will really be qualified to be accepted as sophomore. I'm just an international student planning on going to community college this coming fall and I'm not really sure if I could get accepted with only a short time to prepare. I've heard that the admission office concentrate more on the SAT and High school GPA for candidates transferring for the sophomore year but the website doesn't really state anything about SAT on the transfer requirements for either sophomore or junior. I've never taken the SAT, will I need to take that exam? And can I have some advice or tips on transferring as a sophomore? What should I concentrate on? My ECs are not that great either.

Here are some additional information about me if that's any help:

My ECs: 
-I am a son of missionaries and so I lived in the Philippines for 9 years helping my parents in their mission in providing medicines, building churches and preschool for the poor.
-I am an amateur muay thai fighter(3 years): Ultimate Knockout Championship winner and was qualified in the national tournament but I declined because I needed to go to Korea for my sick grandfather. 
-I was an assistant trainer in my gym.
-Summer program teacher for children age 6-11.
-Got the job as a chef in a Japanese restaurant and will be working on August.
-Volunteering in Church
also I will be planning on volunteering as a mentor and tutor this summer. 
My High School grade:
-85-86 percent average
-Mr. Junior during prom (if that's any good for an award but that's the only award I got :( lol)

I am not specifically asking to chance me to Cornell but I would like to know how I'm doing now and what I should concentrate on to improve. I don't really feel prepared to apply for sophomore year. I think I should need at least 2 years to prepare so I can apply as a junior transfer applicant but seeing that the school prefer strongly for sophomore applicants, I feel  like I have no time. If I get rejected because I couldn't prepare enough for sophomore year will I be able to re apply on junior year? I am truly sorry for this long post but please help a young student out. Thank you so much for reading and I hope I could get some great answers!! 
Let's get a quick survey of what Cornell Redditors are doing this summer. I'll start.

Year: Graduate
Activity: Working on thesis, starting online business. 
I'm going to be heading to Cornell this August to start my MBA and I'm wondering whether I should try to bring my car or just sell it before I go.  It's an AWD Subaru station wagon so it should be decent in the snow, but I plan to live close enough to walk or bus to Johnson so it won't be my primary means of transportation.  Ithaca seems pretty small and isolated so I'm not sure how often I'll really need to drive anywhere, but maybe there's lots of stuff to do outside the immediate area where a car would be really useful.

I'd love to hear your thoughts.

Hi we are in need of fining someone to rent my buddies room for the spring semester next year. What's the best way to go about finding someone as quick as possible? We've posted on Uloop and the Class page so far. 
I know that they have "family" housing, but we're not married.

 The other issue is that my parents are not emotionally ready to deal with the fact that we are moving in together sometime next year. They will be helping me to find a place in Ithaca, but they don't know that my boyfriend will be joining me; therefore, I can't ask for something like family housing.

 My question then, is that if I get a Cornell-associated apartment (assuming that there are any left), is my boyfriend's arrival going to be a problem? Are there inspections like at dorms, for which his presence will be frowned upon/forbidden? Are there zoning law issues with 1 bedroom places at Cornell? I don't want to put him on the lease, I don't want to tell my parents yet, and I don't want to do anything that's going to cause issues with the University/the law.

Advice? Similar experiences?


Hello all! I am actually a high school student, and this year I will be going to pre-medicine in Canada. Now, I know that for the US, there is no vet. for undergraduate, so I need to take certain courses in order to be eligible to apply for vet, no matter if I study vet in the US or if I'm staying in Canada.

I, sadly, do not have the money to study undergraduate in Cornell, so I was planning on doing 4 years of undergraduate in Canada, my hometown, and then transferring to Cornell for veterinary.

I know competition is fierce, but I was wondering if graduate entry into Cornell would be easier than undergraduate, and also if my international status will be more preferred (we all know those UC schools kill themselves for us).

Cornell is my dream university, and I've been longing to study here since I was in Grade 8, but unfortunately I simply cannot do so, thus I wanted to see if I would have another chance in graduate levels.

Thanks!


The weather's too nice to be indoors.

So, where's the best place to run 3 to 6 miles? I live on North Campus, and don't have a car, so downtown (e.g. around Cayuga Lake) isn't the most convenient option. I've tried finding maps of trails online and am coming up short. 

There's allegedly a ton of 5ks at the Plantations, but I haven't been there yet. What's the best way to get there from campus? (I run to part of it, but apparently not to the arboretum). Are there paved roads or specific trails in the arboretum that I'm missing? Where are these magical places? 





WOOOOOOOOO! GO BIG RED! WIN IN OT!
Hi all,
I was wondering if you had any recommendations for a rising sophomore looking for an off-campus apartment (ideally a 5 bedroom).  Thanks
This is a final project for INFO/CS 2300 - Intermediate Design and Programming for the Web.  This only involves the designing of the website, you will have to set up the web hosting yourself and obviously come up with your domain name.  You will have to meet with my group and I a couple times throughout the rest of the semester and we must implicate database schema into the website.  This can easily be done if you have a catalog of products you wish to sell or maybe a list of club members or something if the site is for a club.  Comment if you're interested!
Maybe this time I'll make it through the spam filter.

edit: Looks like the prize goes to sirkent.
I am an incoming freshman, and my room mate and I are deciding on which hall/building is best.  Any input is appreciated!

Hello!  I'm pleased to say I was accepted to Cornell today -- my dad went here, which ~~probably~~ definitely ~~helped my case~~ got me in, but I'm psyched about it either way!

To my question.  I was accepted as a prospective Linguistics major to A&amp;S.  Is there anybody out there who's done the same major?  Any advice, suggestions, general comments, anything specific to linguistics?  How strong is the faculty, is it easy to switch majors, is it easy to double major if one major is linguistics, is there any particular huge pull or drawback?

Also, relatively unrelated, is there a pre-law advising program at Cornell?  How strong is it, in your personal experience (not what the Office would tell me)?

Thank you in advance!!!

As a potential pre-med student, I am choosing between Cornell, Duke, and Penn. What are some of the pros and cons of each?
I'm going abroad for the spring semester and there seems to be ZERO places to sublet for the fall. When (or if at all) will fall sublets become available and does anyone have any suggestions?  
Hey guys,

Im super excited to attend Cornell this upcoming Fall! I was wondering, what do you guys like to do around Ithaca during your free time? I come from a pretty big urban city, so moving to Ithaca will be a new change for me. What are some fun things to do on campus and off campus besides enjoy the trees and waterfalls? During my free time I just usually go hang out with friends, read, sleep, and eat good food, lol.

Also, I will be visiting Cornell in a few weeks. Are there any places/things I should visit/do while on my trip?

Thanks you!
I saw UPenn was ranked #1 for party schools by PlayBoy and I was wondering what you guys thought about Cornell as a party school. I am deciding between schools right now and I wanted to have some fun in college so whats the party scene like at Cornell?
Hey guys. I was recently admitted as an Urban and Regional Studies major in AAP. I am currently debating studying architecture at UC Berkeley or URS at Cornell. I am from the west coast and am very torn on whether to stay kinda close to home and attend Berkeley (I'm OOS) or step out of what I've been used to my whole life (urban environment) to a bucolic setting. One of the biggest factors is going to be my financial aid from Cornell but it hasn't arrived in the mail yet.

What is living in Ithaca like/traveling home during break? I was looking at flights and it seems like a pain in the ass to get there from where I live. 
What is the URS program like? Is it very hands on or more conceptual? What is student life at Cornell like?
Do AP credits give placement or credits? The website had me very confused.
 I'm admitted to the class of 2020 and was wondering what clothing should I get for winters.

I'm from a warmer climate so I really have no clue on what kind of things I should be wearing!
Hi everyone.

I was admitted into UIUC and Cornell for mechanical engineering. However, I plan on changing my major to computer engineering at whichever school I choose to attend. The cost will be about the same for both schools.

I am leaning more towards UIUC because the strength of their ECE department, even though everyone else is telling me to go to Cornell because they've never heard of U of I. I realize Cornell has a great ECE department as well, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think UIUC has a slight edge. 

Would you say one school has an advantage over another? What the professors like? Class sizes? Are there any significant reasons I should choose Cornell over UIUC? I've never really cared about name recognition or prestige, and I think within engineering both UIUC and Cornell are well known and well respected.  

I realize both are good schools and I don't really have a bad option here. I'm just looking for more insight into both schools. Thanks everyone!
I am a venture capitalist on the look out for cornell startups in need of seed money.

Is there a website listing cornell led startups requiring seed funding? 
Hello I have just been accepted to the College of Human Ecology through RD for class of 2020. I am super excited about the the prospect of attending Cornell this fall! But I still have some reservations. While I am still interested in my original intended major (Design + Environmental Analysis), since I applied to Cornell I have become more and more interested in studying computer science. Does anyone know about the process of transferring from the College of Human Ecology to the College of Arts and Sciences? I am more interested in transferring to Arts and Sciences rather than Engineering - I know a CS major is offered in both. Is this transfer easy enough to do? Or should I consider going to another school where I have been accepted to do CS? 

Thanks very much! Any info is appreciated.
Hello, I'm a CS major in the College of Engineering. I have a lot of academic interests/passions and I'm trying to prioritize them before the next pre-enroll period. I went through the list of minors that Cornell has to offer and was left with three that interested me most: Info Sci, Linguistics, and the Dyson Business Minor for Engineers.

This might sound crazy, but I want to minor in all three. I'm willing to put in the work, and with careful planning I think that it actually won't be as much work as it sounds. 

Am I allowed to use my major-required elective courses to "double-count" for minors? 

For example, I want to take CS 4740 and CS 4744 as part of my CS electives. These courses are cross-listed as LING 4474 and LING 4424 respectively, and are acceptable classes to count towards the linguistics minor. LING 4424 is even allowed for the Info Sci minor--is it ok to use one course to fulfill a major requirement and two minor requirements all at once?

Another question I have is: are minors even "useful"? I'm using them primarily as a way to organize my interests into groups of courses that are deemed related enough by Cornell to be called a minor. But what will employers think if they look at my future resume and see CS Major and triple minor? I want it to reflect my academic passions but am worried it will make it look as if I gamed the system (which I guess I kind of am).

Also just for fun, what are your majors / minors? What drives your passions? Personally, I love CS because I view it as a nice mix between science and art. It's a great way of approaching problem solving and what I believe to be the future of humanity.
I'm an InfoSci major with an interest in data science and machine learning, for which LinAlg is important. I've heard that 2310 would be sufficient, but I know that Healy is teaching 2940 right now, and from what I hear, he is a great teacher (a rarity among profs IMO). Andrew Roberts taught 2310 last Fall, but I don't know anything about him except that he's fairly new. And then there's 2210. Anyone have any insight into the differences? What about the professors who teach these courses? I think I'd rather take a harder course with a good teacher than the opposite. Btw, 2940 lists multi-var calc as a prereq, which I haven't taken. How much calc is actually required for 2940? Thx.

Has anyone taken this course, and how was it? Bunea is teaching it this coming semester. Anyone know anything about her and how well she teaches? Thanks.
I was accepted RD and I'm really excited about going. I love everything that I've read about Cornell and I'm visiting next week to get a feel for the campus. But what I haven't been able to really get a feel for is the student body. My main question: is there a lot of school spirit? I hope to be surrounded by people who are just as passionate about Cornell as I am. 
Hi, I know a real douche who lied on his common app. He fabricated a charity to get him into Cornell and other schools. How should I report this? I think its completely unethical...
All of Cornell's PE offerings have me super excited and I can't wait to start taking them next year. However, I would have a lot of trouble narrowing down my choices to just one per semester.

So far I'm planning on taking Gymnastics, Figure Skating, and Modern Dance my 1st semester and Figure Skating, Barre, and Classical Dance my 2nd semester. Will my advisor let me take that much? I take 7+ hours of dance per week plus other exercise now so I know I can handle it physically/time wise, but is there some sort of rule against taking multiple PE classes that I haven't been able to find?

Thank you all so much for your help.
Hi!

I'm an international student who was recently admitted to Cornell for this upcoming fall. A few days ago, I received an email from the financial aid office saying I had been waitlisted for financial aid.


Does anyone know how this works, and the likelihood of getting financial aid? Cornell has been my dream school and without financial aid, I highly doubt I'll be able to attend



Thank you!!
I’m interested in doing Cornell in Washington fall of my junior year. I went to one of the info sessions in the Arts Quad and talked to a couple of past participants who were generically positive about CIW but wanted to get input from a larger audience. 

Did anybody on here do the program? What did you think? Did you keep in touch with the other participants or did everyone kind of go their own way once they returned to campus? Was it hard finding an internship, and did you get meaningful work to do? What was living in the Wolpe Center like? Were the professors tough, and did you get a lot out of writing your required policy paper?

I know these are a lot of questions so even answering one or two of them would be appreciated. Thanks! 
I wanted to watch a sporting event in a few weekends with a few of my friends. I know the room that can be reserved in Olin has a TV, but I don't know if we're allowed to reserve it if we're just going to be watching sports. I wanted to know whether that's allowed, and if not, whether there are good places where we can do this. 
So whats the difference between all the libraries at Cornell? Are they split by grad/undergrad? Whats the deal?
I took AP Computer Science last year, and pulled a 5 on the exam, and have since done two internships in CS, one in PHP, one in Python. I am also studying JavaScript on my own, but I would say it is the language I am weakest in. However, my APCS class didn't cover GUIs, and I know the syllabus for the intro class states that it is covered in the class. What would be the pros and cons of taking the intro class vs taking the AP credit?
The Brain Team, Ithaca High School's nationally-ranked quizbowl team, is hosting their annual [spring trivia night](https://www.facebook.com/events/771191663018344/) in the IHS Cafeteria on Thursday, April 14th from 6:00 to 8:30. Ten dollars gets you dinner and treats, funky music, and of course fun trivia. Come on your own or bring a team of up to five and try your best. There will be prizes for the winning teams! PM me if you need more information, or just show up at the cafeteria by 6!

The Brain Team has had an outstanding year in academic quizbowl tournaments both locally and in New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania, with several tournament wins.  Our A team also made its first appearance at a college-level tournament at the University of Pennsylvania in the fall, where they finished the tournament with a 6-6 record and wins against teams from Cornell, Penn State, Columbia, and VCU.  Overall, the team is [ranked 3rd in the state and 53rd in the world](https://hsqbrank.com/2016/01/08/top-200-high-school-teams-172016/) and has qualified to three nation tournaments in Dallas, Chicago, and Washington DC, the first of which is next weekend!  The expenses for these tournaments are significant - we've already spent $3000 in registration, transportation, and hotels. Our trivia night fundraisers go a long way to helping us cover these expenses, and your financial support is critical in helping us continue to perform at a national level.

Thank you very much for your continued support, and we hope to see you on Thursday!


I have a friend coming to visit. Is there a place where they could park their car overnight? How much is it?

I'm in town looking at Cornell (I was admitted last month) and my father and I are looking for the best pizza restaurant within reasonable distance of campus. Does anyone have any recommendations? 

Update: 

After many recommendations, we went with the Nines tonight. I got a deep dish that was absolutely amazing. Their sauce and cheese is incredible, if a little pricey. I'll certainly be back if I end up in Ithaca come August. We'll be hanging around Ithaca tomorrow; if anyone has any suggestions for how to spend the day, feel free to drop me a PM. I'll be monitoring this post during the day and I'll probably pick another pizza place for dinner tomorrow -- we'll see!! Thanks for all the suggestions! 
Computers have always been my passion and I wholly intend to declare my major as CS next year, but I want to make sure if its usual to go in with little to no knowledge of programming/coding? Unfortunately, I come from a rather small, rural high school that didn't offer any computer science or engineering classes, and I would have loved to teach myself coding, but was always too busy during the school year and working almost every day during the summer. I've been building and tinkering with computers for about 4 years now, but never really got around to coding unfortunately; I plan on trying to learn as much as I can this summer through Code Academy though. Any insight is greatly appreciated.

P.S. If any coders/CS majors know a better place to start than Code Academy lemme know.
I'm planning on taking CS 2800 next semester so I'm not sure if it would be a good idea to take CS 3110 at the same time.

I'm planning on doing the AI/Machine Learning vector and it seems like none of those courses have either of these as a prereq so it doesn't seem to matter in that sense.

So I'm leaning towards taking CS 3410 but any advice would be appreciated.
For those of you who are living in Cascadilla this year (preferably first floor doubles) do you have any pictures of your rooms? My future roommate and I are curious as to what the space is like. Anything that you have would be much appreciated! Go Big Red! 
how is the statistical science major? average course intensity/gpa? professors overall?
My plan was to pre-enroll in 3110, but every spot is taken. So would it be best to sign up for some other class but attend CS 3110 until a spot is available? I would assume a large portion of the class would drop like this semester, so the chances of actually getting a spot seem decent, I just worry that people will drop the course really late and I'd be stuck not knowing the material for the class I didn't attend.
Hey guys, so I'm a Pre-Frosh who will be attending in the fall. I'm confused on when/how I'll pick my classes. I know registration is in July but am I supposed to do anything before then? And how do I know what classes to enroll in and which ones I can opt out of due to AP credit? 

Will my college contact me at all and inform me with what I should be taking or starting out with?

If it helps at all, I'm a CS major in the College of Arts and Sciences.

Thanks for any help!
What are the big differences between AEP 3610-3620 and PHY 3316-3317-4443?
I'm an incoming ILRie, and one of the things I noticed when I visited here two days ago (not for Cornell Days, for a tournament) was that Ives Hall, where most of the ILR classes are, is pretty far away from North Campus, where I believe the freshman all live. Now, I'm disabled (poor vision) and have always had trouble navigating, and I'm concerned about physically getting around campus with the directions and all, especially in the winter when visibility's lower and the ground is more slippery. Any advice?
