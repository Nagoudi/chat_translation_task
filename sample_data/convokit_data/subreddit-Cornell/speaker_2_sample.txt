Let me know what you guys think! Any feedback is always appreciated. If you like it, tell your friends :) If you find a problem, let me know as well.
so, i'm starting to mess with some of the css on our lovely subreddit.. anyone have any fun suggestions about our little envelope? or up/downvote things? GO NUTS. 
Ever since SOPA put fear into the hearts of everyone that loves the internet, it looks like [The DarkNet Plan](http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan) has grown by the thousands and even got [national media attention](http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2011/11/23/wary-of-sopa-reddit-users-aim-to-build-a-new-censorship-free-internet/).

What is the feasibility of doing that for our big red campus?

So I signed with Cornell as a swimmer a couple of months ago, and as a freshman-to-be I'm beginning put some thought into my future living situations.  As a swimmer I can choose between sharing a townhouse with three others, or taking a dorm.  I went on a recruit trip back in October and got to see the townhouse, but only for a little bit.  I was wondering if anyone had any opinions on the townhouse vs. a dorm.  Anything is greatly appreciated, and I can't wait to represent Big Red next year!
Hey r/cornell! I was wondering what the bars were like in Ithaca during the winter session when the undergrads are gone. Is collegetown empty but the commons still alive?
I heard a rumor today that the Palms is closed/closing. I know these rumors go around every year, but can someone please confirm/deny this?


Do any of the Ithaca area (collegetown, commons, downtown) bars have a good trivia scene? Which nights do different bars have trivia and do any of them have good food/drink deals during trivia?
Incoming freshman here. I was looking at the language department, and was a bit surprised that swedish was missing. In fact, I didn't see any scandinavian languages. I've spent some time over there, and was really looking forward to formally studying swedish/norwegian. 

Anyone know if it'll be offered next fall? Or if there is a way to request a class for it, get a special tutor, etc.? 
Is there a way to sync my ical/google/Exchange to the Student Center calendar?  The registrar keeps making changes which means that I have to find changes by hand and update my Exchange calendar (and risk missing a change).

Howdy,

I realize we may be a minority here, but I would like to extend an open invitation to any and all Cornell ents to form an organization dedicated to promoting the semi-regular, semi-epic chilling of awesome dudes and ladies across the community this semester. More details to follow pending the support this idea receives.

~~First meeting will be **this weekend** for an epic trip to the movies! Some suggestions: Pulp Fiction and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy are playing at Cinemopolis, and Regal has a couple cool 3D movies (TinTin, Beauty &amp;&amp; da Beast) plus some new action flicks (Mission Impossibru, Red Tails). I personally have Carshare, so I can take up to 7 in a minivan if peeps can't handle the buses.~~

Due to lack of interest, this week's meetup was not successful. Please post in this thread if you like this idea! For clarification, I am talking about [ents,](http://trees.reddit.com) not Ear Nose and Throat doctors. :P


I will be taking my daughter out in April coming from the West coast.  Can anyone recommend the best route to Fly?  I have seen going into JFK then a flight to Syracuse.  Is there a more direct way?

Stop by Mann Lobby today and buy a baked good to benefit three local Elmira boys that lost their parents in a car accident last month! 

Everything is a dollar, and we have a range from fresh baked bread to homemade peanut butter cookies! 

Thanks! 
Hi Guys!

I'm from Binghamton University, and I was hoping to see if I could crash with a Redditor up at Cornell for slope day! A bunch of friends are going up Thursday night, and are staying with their girlfriends and leaving Saturday morning(I don't have a place to stay :c). I was hoping to come up Thursday night via bus(if it's okay, if not I completely understand), take part in Slope Day activities and stay Friday night and leave in the morning. If you can just do Friday, that's fine too!

If anyone would be cool with this, I would love you forever! I really just need a couch or something something simple. Thanks so much! :D
Title says it all. If you are interested PM me and I will give you my NetID, etc.

The Slope is a given, and anywhere with Wifi is a plus. What are your opinions?
Cornell's websites are absolute shit, particularly in terms of clarity on this issue: the academic calendar says that residence halls open on the 23rd of August, but when exactly am I supposed to move in? Is there a time slot, or can I just show up whenever? For the record I'll be living in one of the Flora Rose gothics.
I'm on West and I checked speedtest.net and I'm downloading at &lt;1 mbps
[**I wrote a cleaned up version of this on my blog, Table Theory. Check it out.**](http://tabletheory.wordpress.com/2013/05/09/the-table-theory-guide-for-the-cornell-university-class-of-2017/)

A lot of this will sound obvious. Well, fuck you, because I didn't know this shit as a 17 year old straight-laced tightwad nerd who was getting his first taste of freedom.

(For reference, I'm now a 27 year old tightwad nerd... though much less straight laced and probably a little drunk).

**Academics**

* Get used to not being the smartest person in the room. It's okay. It just means that, *gasp*, you have something to learn.
* Ask for help if you need it. Seriously. Don't be an asshole like I was and think "it's weak to ask for help because I never needed it in HS."
* Go to class. Every single fucking class. And study. Most of the stress people end up having is from not doing well. The stress of studying is easy in comparison.
* Find out what kind of worker you are: I'm only effective with lots of structure and scheduling, and deadlines to keep me on track. I didn't learn that until after I made a really stupid, lazy roster. Take the first semester to learn how to be effective, and apply it the rest of your 4 years.
* Be smart about how much you can reasonably handle per semester. Yes, you're a full time student, but you need time to unwind, too.
* If you are a gamer, your room is the WORST place to study. Go outside, or to a library, or to CTB, or anywhere. Just not in front of your computer and its sweet, sweet Counterstrike.
* Learn to swim over the summer if you don't know already. CU actually has really fun gym class options, and it sucks to have to spend a semester learning how to swim when you can be rock climbing/pistol shooting/archery-ing/riding horses instead.

**Social Stuff**

* At orientation, you'll lots of people. It's exciting. One of them may even touch your boner (or lady boner). So, be friendly - but also be realistic. Finding people you click with takes effort, so yes, you have to put your best foot forward and get out there, but that doesn't mean latching onto the first person who tolerates you. Be upbeat, have something to offer everyone, and really feel people out from the perspective of whether you really enjoy spending your time with them.
* Talk to everyone. You don't have to be best friends with everyone, but introduce yourself. Ask them about what they like. Listen. You're going to meet people from places you've never been who grew up in ways you never did. Learn and, when possible, have fun with them.
* Start a dinner group. Even just two people. It's therapeutic.
* DO NOT HAVE YOUR FIRST DRUNKEN EXPERIENCE WITH PEOPLE YOU HAVEN'T KNOWN LONG ENOUGH TO TRUST WITH YOUR LIFE. Teenagers have no fucking clue on how to take care of a drunk. So, yeah, have a drink or two, but don't give into shot pressure if you know you suck at drinking (or have no idea how much you can drink). Also, medical amnesty - if you pass out, call the fucking EMTs. People die when they ignore this.
* When you first throw up and get your first hangover, don't be the dick who says "I'm never drinking again." Just suck it up, drink some gatorade, brush your teeth and walk it of. Your liver will be taking much more punishment in the next four years.
* I found that the best way to meet people I clicked with was through activities - so make sure you check out the club fairs, and try a lot of things out the first couple weeks. After that, stick around for what ACTIVITY you enjoy most. Trust me, you'll build much stronger friendships if you follow your passion, rather than just joining something because the people seem cool to you.
* On that note, join the ballroom dance team *cough cough.*

**Dorms and Roommates**

* Good boundaries are key, and unless you both grew up responsible enough to never need your parents to clean up after you, you have shitty boundaries. No problem, but always remember that in any dispute, *you might be the asshole in that scenario.*
* Be a person of your word. Be prepared to split chores, and even do some things that you dislike, because your roommate will also be doing things he or she dislikes. It beats being passive aggressive and hating the hours you have to spend in your room because you're not allowed to sleep anywhere else.
* That said, even when your roommate situation is great, less time in your room is best for everyone who lives there.
* Sexile is not completely off-limits as long as you call ahead, and make it worth your roommate's while. He or she will be doing you a solid, so either be prepared to reciprocate in some way or don't do it.
* It's not where you live, it's what you make of it. I know more people who are still friends/in touch from Donlon 6 today than from any other dorm I've ever heard of.
* On that note, just because you're living in the same building as someone doesn't make it more likely for you to end up as good friends. Hang around people because you like them not because it's easy.
* If you piss on the seat, clean it, or vigilante justice IS warranted. 

**Dating**

* This is for guys and girls. Don't rush into or out of relationships. College is a different ball field, yes, but that doesn't mean you should just go all in or all out. This is one of the few times in your life when it's really completely cool to just be unattached - where no one will be in your business and making you feel like an asshole or a slut for dating lots of people (okay, some people may still do that. But, none of them is writing you a paycheck, so fuck 'em). At the same time, don't just bail on a good situation just because you can. You'll stunt your growth in relationships in either extreme.
* For the love of god, people, if someone wants to spend time with you, they will make it as easy as possible. If you have to call someone 5 times for them to even answer, they don't wanna hang out with you, holmes. Sorry.
* Nice clothes (non-college bum couture) goes a pretty long way in making you noticeable.
* Never, ever date someone just because the sex is good. Make that person a FWB. And don't be ashamed of that arrangement. It's actually kind of awesome.
* If you're a virgin, it's cool. Lots of people willing to let you practice.
* If you want to stay a virgin, that's cool too. There are lots of people who are doing the same thing.

**Cornelliana that I personally really loved**

* Go to your corny floor events. Go to the corny dances. Go to all of the things, at least to stop by and see it. You'll miss it after you've graduated.
* Go gorge jumping. There's only a short period of time when it's actually warm enough on campus to do. Make sure you a) know how to swim, and b) are with someone who knows how to get to the jump points.
* You gotta go to at least ONE frat party. I'm a party animal, and even then frat parties weren't my thing (too many people I didn't know) - but I never would have known that and then learned to throw my own parties if I didn't try one.
* Risley is pretty fuckin' cool. If they still have it, ask about pool. Or a Balch run. Also, go to at least one Rocky Horror picture show.
* Cornell cinema regularly shows films that you might never see anywhere else. Check it out.
* Buy an article of Cornell clothing. There are so many of us in the world that I'm always surprised by how much Cornell gear I see out there - instant connection. 
* Slope Day. Forever and always.

**Other Thoughts**

* Ithaca ruins shoes. Bring sturdy snow boots. That's all you'll hear me say about the weather.

Just realized this was the case. I'm supposed to be going with my (senior) boyfriend. I am a junior. In past years this has been allowed, but now in the FAQ on senior week, we see a note that says Duff Ball is for seniors only, no guests or underclassmen. Anyone know why this is? 

I'm going to be at Cornell just for the summer for an internship, and I was wondering whether there is pickup frisbee in June/July, and whether there are spaces/fields on campus for the public for throwing. I'm also considering joining the summer league if there is no pickup. In any case, is there public transportation from Rose House to Cass Park or Buttermilk Fields (it doesn't seem walkable on Google Maps)? If not, is there on-campus pickup frisbee? Thanks!


Who's going to be here for the summer?

Enjoy the rest of your week... Good luck with what is to come... and see you all at the top!
Good day :]
I am an 18 years old student hoping to apply as a transfer student to CALS major in AEM in the near future but I am quite confused with the information on the official website. It says here http://cals.cornell.edu/admissions/apply/transfer/requirements/aem/ that "Strong preference will be given to candidates who will be transferring in the fall of their sophomore year. (Only in special circumstances will admission be offered to candidates transferring in the spring or in their junior year.)" but I don't think I will really be qualified to be accepted as sophomore. I'm just an international student planning on going to community college this coming fall and I'm not really sure if I could get accepted with only a short time to prepare. I've heard that the admission office concentrate more on the SAT and High school GPA for candidates transferring for the sophomore year but the website doesn't really state anything about SAT on the transfer requirements for either sophomore or junior. I've never taken the SAT, will I need to take that exam? And can I have some advice or tips on transferring as a sophomore? What should I concentrate on? My ECs are not that great either.

Here are some additional information about me if that's any help:

My ECs: 
-I am a son of missionaries and so I lived in the Philippines for 9 years helping my parents in their mission in providing medicines, building churches and preschool for the poor.
-I am an amateur muay thai fighter(3 years): Ultimate Knockout Championship winner and was qualified in the national tournament but I declined because I needed to go to Korea for my sick grandfather. 
-I was an assistant trainer in my gym.
-Summer program teacher for children age 6-11.
-Got the job as a chef in a Japanese restaurant and will be working on August.
-Volunteering in Church
also I will be planning on volunteering as a mentor and tutor this summer. 
My High School grade:
-85-86 percent average
-Mr. Junior during prom (if that's any good for an award but that's the only award I got :( lol)

I am not specifically asking to chance me to Cornell but I would like to know how I'm doing now and what I should concentrate on to improve. I don't really feel prepared to apply for sophomore year. I think I should need at least 2 years to prepare so I can apply as a junior transfer applicant but seeing that the school prefer strongly for sophomore applicants, I feel  like I have no time. If I get rejected because I couldn't prepare enough for sophomore year will I be able to re apply on junior year? I am truly sorry for this long post but please help a student out. Thank you so much for taking your time reading this and I hope I could get some great answers!! 

They're behind a paywall, and library.cornell.edu doesn't seem to have access to them. Trying to get to the full text of [this article](http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=OAA-1992-WC3). 
Longshot but just in case someone happens to know about these apartments, it would be great. We are trying to finalize an apartment but the online reviews all seem gloomy for all apartments. We are very confused and do not know where to turn to for an honest opinion. We are still not in Ithaca so can not go and see for ourselves. Their website is [here](http://www.kimballrentals.com/UniversityPark). Thanks.

*Edit: Wow, we are definitely not going there.
**Edit: Could you kindly suggest some apartment/house for a family w/ 2 kids.




Selling for 20$, pm me if interested. 
Hello all! I am actually a high school student, and this year I will be going to pre-medicine in Canada. Now, I know that for the US, there is no vet. for undergraduate, so I need to take certain courses in order to be eligible to apply for vet, no matter if I study vet in the US or if I'm staying in Canada.

I, sadly, do not have the money to study undergraduate in Cornell, so I was planning on doing 4 years of undergraduate in Canada, my hometown, and then transferring to Cornell for veterinary. 

I know competition is fierce, but I was wondering if graduate entry into  Cornell would be easier than undergraduate, and also if my international status will be more preferred (we all know those UC schools kill themselves for us).

Cornell is my dream university, and I've been longing to study here since I was in Grade 8, but unfortunately I simply cannot do so, thus I wanted to see if I would have another chance in graduate levels.

Thanks!
That was stressful.

So do folks at Cornell get excited about March Madness?  I know you love your hockey but I was curious about basketball?



Just wondering if there are PUAs at Cornell. My buddy and I started a small group right now, and we know there are more PUA out there, but just laying low. Please PM me if you want to go out sarging with us and practice.



3-2 in overtime.

Replays of today's game are available on ESPN3.

Tomorrow is the Midwest Regional Finals, 2 Ferris State vs 4 Cornell, 9PM EST on ESPNU and ESPN3


Hi!  I was accepted to grad school at Cornell.  I'll be visiting the campus very soon to see what Cornell &amp; Ithaca are like. Do you have any recommendations on places on or near campus I should visit? 

Also, I applied for grad housing after I got accepted. Now, they say it's not guaranteed. I'll be contacting/visiting the housing people at some point... But how likely am I to get housing based on your experience?


I was considering RELST 3310. Anyone familiar with this course?
John and Garrett here. We found out that West Pinto Trail has been mostly overgrown/un-hiked since 2007/08. We hiked out in about 4 1/2 hours, we appreciate you putting out the fire. That morning/afternoon storm chased us out. We got stuck momentarily in the mud on the road before the mine. Very interested in any info on your trip.
So I made it! I got into ILR, and it's pretty much my dream school, so I couldn't be happier right now. The only question I have is what are internships like, especially in politics and government. Ithaca isn't exactly a bustling metropolis with lots of opportunities there to offer. I know there's Cornell in Washington, and that sounds like a program I'd be interested in, but what are internships like here?

Don't be afraid to give a negative answer; I'm weighing every factor I can before making a decision, and this is but one.
Current student (congratulations and welcome to all the new admits!!) who was wondering if we had an official Class of 2020 student group. Right now there are two or three but one is run by an advertising agency and the other two are pretty small…it would be nice if admissions got a group going so that prospective students could connect with each other without having to sift through the random or trolly posts usually seen in unregulated ones. 
I have been accepted to the M.Eng.(ECE) programme at Cornell University for the coming term. I wanted to get some perspective from current students/alumni (ECE M.Eng.) regarding:

(1) The current job scene, Especially in renewable energy.

(2) Job Fairs at Cornell

(3) How the program compares to other 2-year courses as it is over the course of one year only.
If one is planning to go to Math grad school, how important/recommended is it to take the following classes:
a) MATH 3040 ?
b) MATH 4130-4140 ?
I'm a freshman right now, taking math 2210 (linear algebra). At first I wasn't sure if I wanted to pursue math at a higher level and I wanted to get some other gen. ed. requirements out of the way so I didn't take a math course last semester. 

However, I'm kind of regretting that decision since I really want to take 3110 (intro to analysis) next semester, but one of the prereqs is 2220 (multivariable calc), which I'll be taking next semester. 

Is it possible and do-able to take 3110 and 2220 concurrently and just ignore the prerequisite? I took multivariable in high school, and regardless, I plan to review the material over the summer anyway so the material in 2220 will mostly just be review. 

I'm thinking about doing the math major along with something like physics or CS, but I'm not planning to go to grad school in math, in case that's relevant. 
Is it actually as tough as many claim it to be? What is the average GPA like at the school? I know some majors might be easier than others, but I am just wondering about an overall feel. 
hey guys- I've been admitted to Cornell's SHA (among a number of different universities) and would like some clarification. I am a math focused student who's primary interest lies in Finance. I hope to go into investment banking upon graduation. My application to SHA was rooted in some work experience in restaurants and the knowledge that my chances at Dyson were slim.

1.) Is a BS in Hotel Administration a legitimate degree?


2.) How rigorous is the curriculum? From my understanding, "hotelies" are often seen as a joke.

Thanks for the insight everybody- I really hope that I can make Cornell my home for the next 4 years :)
Just got accepted through RD, and was wondering if there were any tips or tidbits that the newest batch of Cornellians could appreciate?
i.e.: Best Gym, cheapest way to get to NYC, tricks to get the classes you want?
Hey guys,
I'm a Comm major over here with enough credits taken care of to kind of take whatever I want. I just want some personal recommendations of and classes you all enjoyed or really think you got great learning experience from. If there's that class you will always remember, I'm all ears.
Just got into Grad School at Cornell, and i'm wondering what my options are for housing. Are there grad dorms? I want something close to campus and a single room. If there's no dorms like that, which is the best neighborhood to live in as a grad student? ($1000 a month for rent and utilities is my budget) 
I've heard that ECE 2300 -&gt; CS 3420 is a lot slower paced and more in depth, and that 3410 hits pretty hard due to cramming a lot of material into 1 semester. But isn't stretching out 3410 material over 2 semesters more of a hassle?

Also, semi-unrelated question: opinions on ENGRD 2700?
As the title suggests I'm torn between these two majors, I'd like to go into business and more specifically commercial real estate when I graduate. As of right now I see the pros of SHA being: more opportunities/connections in commercial real estate, less focus on taking a wide-range of courses (e.g. A&amp;S: two history courses, two writing seminars), slightly less rigorous/more free time, and less theoretical. And the cons being: over emphasis on strictly hospitality courses, having a "hotel" degree might restrict job search to only hotels. Also, I am curious to know which program I would be most likely to graduate in three years.

Any advice would be appreciated.
I'm in a tough situation right now trying to figure out how to pay for college and I've seen that the average student debt is ~$30,000, but I cannot understand how the hell it's so low. Recently I was admitted to Cornell and I would absolutely love to go there, but they gave me a financial aid notification that I would not be receiving any aid. Both my parents work and make just over 200k combined a year. They've saved ~85k for me in a college fund and ~85k for my sister as well. I appealed the financial aid decision explaining that around $12k of our reported income actually belongs to my grandmother who no longer can do her own taxes, that I have a sibling entering college soon after me, that I have a college fund with just enough money to cover a little over a year at Cornell and that essentially, without financial aid, it would be impossible for me to go. I received the reply to the appeal saying that they would still not offer any financial aid. It seems to me like I'm stuck in the middle spot where my family has too much money to receive aid, but does not make enough to afford paying for me to go. I live in northern Virginia which is a fairly expensive area to live in, and even with well above average household income we are considered middle class here. So at this point I'm just confused--how do the thousands and thousands of students who attend private schools pay for it? Is is worth it to take out 150k in loans? Do people do that? I have also been invited to the university's diversity hosting events and the university is paying for my plane ticket. Despite being denied aid officially via the appeals process, is there anything I could do in person when I visit, or anyone I could plead my case to? It feels as if I've worked my butt off through high school and used up summers for nothing right now. Thank you.
Analog IC Design and CompArch. I've heard that both of these classes are a ton of work, but I'm wondering if it would be possible.
I am currently considering my options for my masters degree and I am trying to understand more about the requirements. Here are my questions:

1. The page says 30 credits are required, does this mean it has to be exactly 30? Am I allowed to enroll in say 31-32 (or even more, haven't decided yet) credits? If yes, do I have to pay extra (since I assume some sort of correlation between the price and the credits)?
2. How does the project choice work? I am most interested in joining a research group, and I understood teacher choice is done during enrollment, but I don't understand when the project choice happens.
3. How do the prerequisites work for the first semester? I obviously haven't done any Cornell courses before, should I try to match up the required Cornell courses with my undergrad courses?

Thanks!

I know Cornell has the reputation for being "the hardest ivy to graduate from," but how bad is it really? obviously yik yak isnt the most reliable source of student voices, but there seems to be far more negativity and dissatisfaction on Cornell's yikyak than any other colleges I've creeped on. 
Is anyone else kind of surprised that the acceptance rate stayed the same as two years ago (and actually went up last year)? If we were building additional campus housing like Yale is I’d be all for it, but as it stands now the housing lottery and getting into some intro classes is already stressful enough…why make it worse by throwing a couple hundred more projected students in the incoming class into the mix? 

I get that we’re the land grant university of NYS and have a mission to educate as many students as possible, but we’re not the only school in the state with a statutory bent, and flagships like Berkeley and Michigan have gotten more selective in recent years as well. Thoughts?
As an incoming freshman, I am very excited to go to Cornell Arts and Sciences. One question about the wifi, can I watch porn freely there? Will any IT people kick my dorm door down and shame me?
Hi there! I'm a newly admitted engineering student enrolling this fall \o/ It's pretty early to start planning out classes but I've started anyways since I'm avoiding studying for my APs. 
I'm divided between two classes offered in the fall:
ENGRI 1620 Visual Imaging in the Electronic Age

ENGRI 1820 Electricity Lights Camera Action: Nanoengineering for the Future Bits and Bytes

Could anyone tell me their experiences in these classes and which of these two you would recommend? 
(admitted student here)

I'll be visiting friday, what should I do? Both parties and non-parties work
I am an alumnus of Cornell, and still around Ithaca. I found a book that is not in Cornell libraries, and the closest library having the book is in UK. I am doing some volunteer work for Cornell, and not currently affiliated with Cornell as a current student or paid employee, so I can't use Cornell's interlibrary service.  Is it possible to borrow the book through some interlibrary service possibly for free? Thanks.
hows housing on campus. Should I request a single, double, triple, or quad as an incoming frosh.


Does anyone else not have power now? Is it out all over campus or just near East Ave? What about in town?
Hey guys,
I'm a cs major with a passion for philosophy and i need some advice wrt taking PHIL3310 (deductive logic ) next smeester. I took CS2800 and MATH2210  this year, so clearly I have some background with propositional logic and quantifiers. Would those two classes be a good foundation for PHIL3310, or should I wait for PHIL2310, the intro version ? If not, what exactly is covered in the intro class that CS and math classes don't cover already?

Thanks in advance

I have to apply for residency every semester, so would that mean I would move out my stuff and then bring it back the next?

Hi all,

Heard some of my friends saying that they can't live off campus because of financial aid. I receive financial aid as well and read here: http://finaid.cornell.edu/special-circumstances/living-campus that it doesn't matter if we live on or off campus. Does anyone here receive financial aid and lives off campus? How exactly does this work?
Hello, I'm a prospective student to Cornell, and I'm currently visiting the campus. I tried to register for an overnight visit through the red carpet program but there were no vacancies available. I know this is very late notice, but is there anyone who would be okay with letting me stay with them and just giving me a hint of dorm and residential life at Cornell? I think it would be very beneficial in making my decision. I'm a normal and relaxed guy, I like music and the outdoors, and I'm interested in the chemistry, stats, philosophy, math, CS and history departments at Cornell. I also have a pad and 
sleeping bag I just need a slice of floor. 

If anyone is willing to host me, or has a friend who would be, or has any comments or advice regarding Cornell, I'd really appreciate your time and help!

Any tips for pre-enrollment? 
Do I just add all my classes in the shopping cart and hope for the best when it starts or Are there any tricks?

What happens if Person A requests to room with you (puts your netID on their housing application) but you put Person B's name on your application and Person B requests your name as well? Would you and Person B end up rooming together? 
Please let me know, thank you so much!
Hi, casual lurker first time poster. I'm currently interested pursuing the University-Wide Business major and wanted know if there was a difference between the HADM and AEM. Is there anything clearly better about taking AEM business classes? I would appreciate any and all advice and should probably add that I'm a PAM major. 
Does anyone know how to login to WSP as a Cornell student? I think Johnson students get it for free?
