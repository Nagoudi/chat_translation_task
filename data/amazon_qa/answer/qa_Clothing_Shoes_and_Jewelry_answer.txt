Midway through I tried out Pimsleur and I found it a lot more practical than Rosetta Stone. Eventually I switched to group classes. In general I would say RS is great for a quick start and vocabulary, Pimsleur is great for practical phrases but in the end there's nothing like a real teacher.
My grandson likes the program and finds it easy to ue.
Not through Rosetta Stone. For 5 months I worked Rosetta Stone every day and it did not produce fluency of any kind. My previous post will tell you why. I purchased a language suite from "Transparent Language" a lot cheaper and much more productive and portable on my tablet.
Yes
I don't know but I'm getting ready to re-install it after not using it for 6-8 months, on my new laptop with touchscreen and Win8. I can comment when I do it.
I am not sure about the question but Rosetta Stone gives you headphones and you have to speak the language unless you do not want to use the speech part. It keeps up with your progress and you have to finish sentences and answer questions,etc. so I guess the answer would be no.
I checked the Rosetta Stone box and it says it operates on the following: Windows XP SP3, Vista SP2, Windows 7 and Windows 8. Hope this helps.
From Rosetta Stone's website FAQ: I purchased the Rosetta Stone Language Learning CD-ROM. How many computers can I install the software on? The software can be installed on up two computers for use for up to five family members
I too am not one to learn languages easily. At the age of 56. I was reluctant to try. However, this program made it fun and as easy as possible for me. I look forward to spending time with this. IT IS worth the money. Best Wishes for your visit to Italy. As a side note, my husband lost his camera while visiting Italy. We had taken a picture of our name and address as the first picture on the memory chip. A wonderful Italian man found it and mailed it to us. The camera came home before my husband! Enjoy your trip!
There are three people using it in our home on the same computer. It remembers where each of us left off and we share the earphones that come with it. I think three or four may be the limit but I am not sure. Enjoy!
Way to bad I didn't see this one before I ordered. One would expect a responsible vendor to quit carrying it. Right Amazon!
No
I am not sure but I believe there would be a Rosetta Stone version for windows. The product is great. I would get in touch with RS directly and ask the question. It worked perfectly for me on a Mac.
Yes, absolutely. I can't remember when we bought it if you had to select Mac or windows but ours works perfectly. Check before you order.
Not me. I'd call customer service.
Hi, Timmy: You should be able to learn from Level 1 Italian to get by. Although I think it would be easier had there been English along with the lessons which are mostly pictures and the oral Italian phrases and sentences with each picture. Not what I expected.
Roy, I believe it's download only. However, I am away for a few weeks so I can't give you an exact answer. I would check the kit, if I was at home. I really got a lot out of the interactive portion. Most of the Italian's that we encountered, except for the train station in Rome, were friendly and very willing to speak English. You might be very frustrated with the dialup. Also, be sure you have enough RAM to hold this program. I learned that lesson the hard way. It won't download, if there's not enough memory, or whatever is needed. I'm not too proficient with computer stuff. So you may want to consult with a second person. Whatever you decide, have a wonderful time in Italy.
I use windows 8 on my laptop. I absolutely LOVE Rosetta Stone. I am learning italian and it is by far the best lesson plan I have EVR had.

No, and when you lock it the combination scrambles. It's a great lock for the price.
My son has used his for his PE Locker which although shaded by the building overhang, is basically outdoors. It has been fine for the past 6 months. It is worth noting that we live in San Diego so rain is minimal - good luck.
"1 color randomly selected at shipment"
Hi Anne, I only have one lock for sale and it is red. Sorry. :(
To be honest, I'm not sure. I would think you could scroll through the differente sellers to see if by chance they have the colors you are looking for. Or you could purchase three 1-pack locks from three different sellers, but I don't know if that would be an easier or smarter alternative for you. I am selling a 1-pack masterlock that is red. I hope the above info helps, if not, good luck :)
In the description the "size" is listed as "one pack" which would lead you to believe that you're getting more than one lock. However, a little further down in the description the "item package quantity" is listed as "one". So you're getting one lock of undetermined color per order.
Spin to the right at least 3 times before starting. 1. Go to the first number (spinning to the right) 2. Go to the left [PASS THE FIRST NUMBER] until you get to second number. 3. To the right, straight to the last number. Good luck!
No
Best for 16 months to three
Yes the opening is big enough. The purse was a huge success!
No. No lights or sound. In fact, the buttons are hard plastic and don't move down when pushed.
No
The toys and purse are like the ones we buy at stores like Walmart and K mart. Our little Grand Daughter is 18 months and she really enjoys them..
It seems to be, It didnt really say much on the plastic wrap, i wrapped it up as a gift for my niece as soon as i recieved it.
I don't know where it was made as I did not pay any attention to that. I have already wrapped it for Christmas and mailed it to my grand daughter who is 18 months old. What I can tell you is that it is very nicely made and seemed to be good quality.
It says China.
Possibly, but they are short. My girls carry them at the crook of their elbow.
Actually, neither one. The dimensions of the bag (length and width) are the size of the bag when it is empty, laying flat on the floor. For instance, the extra large bag, listed as 50" x 30", is actually 48" long x 18" diameter when fully stuffed. The stated measurements, while true, are a bit misleading, since they don't really convey the size in a useful manner.
Hello. Sorry I am taking so long to answer. I had to remember to go out to my garage and check. Yes there is a handle on each end of the bag. There are also hooks on the top on either end for connecting a shoulder strap. It did not come with a shoulder strap but for a couple of bucks I picked on up at a local craft store. I store equipment for my kayak. This was the only bag I found that could hold the paddle (split in half of course.
Canvas - heavy duty.
I once left it outside while it was raining for 5 minutes and nothing got wet
I think it may fit in the bag
The one I bought is black and the end round segment is 18 inches in diameter and zipper end to zipper end it is 50 inches. So I am not sure where the 30 inches comes from on the description . It is a good bag.
Have lent it to a friend so I can't measure, but I see no reason to think it's not exactly as described. It was really huge and a great buy for the money. Just unwieldy because it has no structure, wheels. It is perfect for what I need.
gonna guestimate maybe half a pound.. very light generally speaking... but seems very well built
exactly, the 30 inch is circumference,
I'm not sure. But I don't think it would. I don't think it would zip with something that high.
None. But it does come with two screws to attach it to a 3/4" thick board (size of your choosing).
Yes. My husband drilled holes in it and attached it to a board.
If by the "base", you're referring to what is shown in the picture, yes it does. You do need to attach it on top of something relatively heavy (I usea a piece of 2 by 10 wood), but you could use whatever you want (stone, metal, etc.).
They're not that stiff. I haven't tried golf shoes but I wouldn't be afraid to try.
Yes I bel so - I have installed 6 outside
Yes
If you're referring to Van's shoes, it will work on pretty much any shoes. If your shoes have soles with lots of thin grooves that go across the shoe, it doesn't clean those grooves as well as it cleans diagonal ones or ones that go lengthwise.
It's best to match the polish color to the boots as closely as possible. The great thing about Meltonian is the availability of multiple colors. I've personally used no less than eight different colors with complete satisfaction.
It's 1.55oz
Meltonian offers nearly a dozen shades of "brown" so pick the one closest to the shoes you wish to polish.
Yes. Great stuff. Treats and softens leather and shines. It does not create a "mirror shine" like some "hard" waxes but it is much better for the leather. I sometimes use one after the other. Great stuff.
I use the boot only. I don't see what the difference would be.
The one I got is a solid black cape..
I ordered it small and it fit my 6 year old grandson who is a bit small for his age so it runs a bit big.
If I remember correctly, I think it had velcro under the chin and pulled over the whole head.
No, the mask and cape are one piece.
yes! :)
Yes, it has a belt; it is separate from the costume and it ties in the back.
It ran true to size. If he wear 4t I would go with 4-5
Yes. I ordered it for my 5yr olds bday party
Yes, it does.
my son is 41 inches tall and 32 pounds. obviously very slender and yes i feed him LOL - wish i had his metabolism... anyway, i ordered him the small and it fits well, tho is a bit roomy - i;d say he could still wear it if he was up to 43 inches or so - my GUESS is you would be fine with a medium as your son sounds slender, as well... i know if you google rubies size chart you can pull up their specs and make a better informed decision. a couple things to note - mine came with a pull/run in it - kind of flimsy, but it's for halloween, so it;s not like it s supposed to get a lot of wear. the other is the headpiece (attached to the cowl) is strange looking and not well fitting, i am removing mine and using a mask that goes on like glasses that we got in a happy meal! the mask looks way better and will be safer b/c it fits properly and eye holes are wide - i/, afraid if i use the costume mask he won't see properly. hope this helps! my husband and i are going as catwoman and bane, so if you have any questions on those sizes, let me know
Packed it in my suit case...too many liquids -- would never have gone thru security. Frankly, bought it mostly for car travel, and I hang it along with my clothes. Hope this helps. Hint: I bought duplicates of everything I could possibly need away from home, including a couple of Band-Aids, and never unpack it. Just hang it in the closet, ready for next trip.
You could fold it in half and there is a velcro tab (hook & loop) to help secure it. It depends on what you are storing but you could tri fold it and secure it with a ribbon. It is intended for hanging and folded in half.
It is possible that a travel dryer would fit. The largest compartment is about 6 in. by 9 in. The section does expand some. A dryer might make the bag bulky but it could be done. I have used my hanging bag several times and I really like it.
14" X 28" Bottom pockets are very roomy because of a pleat at the bottom. This is really a great travel bag. This is my second one. I had the first for about 15 years of constant use!
yes, the small foldable ones by conair... in the largest pocket
The metal holding it on is easily bendable! Mine actually bent off and I forced it back on!! So yes!!
No they don't send each section is very small and after one use I had one area rip
No, but I could see the larger pockets accommodating charger cords.
sorry it will not fit a full size can in any pocket
I am sorry Pegi L I will check the exact size and get back with you.
The chart AMAZON provides doesn't tell us the sizing information. However, I found a site that does. http://www.campmor.com/html/smartwoolsocksizechart.shtml MENS (L) - 9-11.5 MENS (XL) - 12-14.5 WOMENS (L) - 10-12.5
I'd say it would be about 50% thicker than your average pair of athletic socks, except on the bottom where I'd say it's about double the thickness and maybe even a little more. If you're concerned about shoe fit with these, if the shoe is snug in normal socks, it will be a mite tight. I've never had a problem with hiking boots or athletic shoes such as you might find in Merrell's or Keen's inventories. But I can't wear them with my cowboy boots.
Short answer: No. These socks are quite thick, and adding a 2nd pair of socks would mean that my boots would be too tight and would not fit. In supremely cold climates (you pick how cold), you need boots that are insulated, as well as warm thick socks. Adding more and more socks, in my experience, does not work - it's not like adding layers of jackets to your torso.
Large. I wear a size 10 and they're big on me
Yes
One. And well worth it!
It depends on which ones you get. The ultra comfy are 90% which is just perfect. The nylon (9%) and elastane (1%) is what keeps them up around leg. Not so tight it bothers you. Buy and ENJOY! I have others with less wool but still snuggy warm and ware very well.
The Smart Wool web site has a size chart. I referenced that before placing my order. Hope this helps :)
One, but they're worth it. I have a pair that's ten years old.
L is for lunatic.
yes, they are fairly long.
The top runs a bit small I bought small and I felt it a bit small. I normally wear size 6 tops.
I washed it in the machine and dried it in dryer and it was fine.
Yes. It wicks away sweat and dries quickly. Keeps me toadty under s wool sweater w a down jacket or vest
Don't know exact weight but it is extremely light.
My wife is 5'8" 140 and a large fits snugly and comfortable. I would say get a Medium.
It appears to be a nylon type fabric. Does keep you warm but tears easily.
no
This product is very thin and is of poor quality. Not suprising that they all weigh the same. You may want to consider another brand.
No
The sizing chart on the package reads: XS=Womens size 4-6, S=Womens size 6-8, M=Womens size 10-12, L=Womens size 14, and XL=Womens size 16
The label reads it is "100% pure silk/sole. It is machine washable & I hand to dry. Comfortable & warm. It's called "Thermasilk". Only downside, it's made in China!
I don't have my exact measurements but I wear a size 6 (or 8 petite) and am 5'2", 130#, and the med fit me a bit loosely but not to the point they "bunched" under my jeans.
Large=sz 13-14, med=size 11-12, small=sz 9-10, xs=7-8. Petite means shorter in the waist down as in the long johns or shorter in the waist up as in blouses. The fabric is thin but under any pair of pants gives me a nice warmth for 32 degrees F. without making the over pair of pants uncomfortable or tight. Probably would not be warm enough for Alaska winters which can get 50 below.
Best to say they are a second skin. We have had 26 degree temps, but I haven't been out for more than 30 min. They don't make you warm & fuzzy, you would need heavier thermals. I find I can wear them even to work, helping get to & from the car & not overheating me while indoors. Hope that answers the question.
They have a loose fit. If you want them to fit like panty hose, order a size or two down.
I would say that XL would fit someone up to about 190 lbs. and up to about 5'8"... I am 5'7" and 160 and they were a bit long.
82 grams

I'm not one to throw away many things especially comfortable clothes that I like. Now with that said, I re-waterproofed a rainsuit that I play golf in and it is several years old. I sprayed two applications on it and wore it in a tournament of two solid days of rain. It held up great until the 15th hole the second day! I don't think I could of asked any more out of it and I was very pleased cause everyone else was soaked! Don't know if this helps or not but seems to be a very good product.
No
I don't see why not but would email the manufacturer on that.
I bought the KIWI CAMP DRY for a friend and she is a real OUTDOORS GIRL!!! She used it on her shoes. It worked great on her canvas and rubber hiking shoes! I'm guess they would work ok with jeans as a water REPELLENT but I would contact the manufacturer of your jeans and make sure your jean are a STAY FAST COLOR so as the spray is worked into the jean fabric, it doesn't mess with the color of your jeans. Some jeans can be very expensive and I would hate to see you mess of the color!!! If they are just cheap work or cheap everyday jeans, I wouldn't be to concerned! Also check on the prices of SCOTCH-GUARD and FABRIC-GUARD. Each of these products might be a bit cheaper and they are designed for fabrics!!!! Hope this helps out some and things workout for you. Have a nice weekend, a fellow Amazon member
I would think it would work fine unless you have sensitive skin then I would worry about rash from chemicals. It worked great on outdoor curtain for me.
No but I used it on curtains I made for my porch. They are made from comforters as windbreaks in the winter in north Florida which is damp and cold in the winter. I just took them down for Spring and there was not mildew to be found. I washed and stored for the season and I will spray them with this product in Fall. It did everything I hoped it would.
Yes it does. I used it on mine.
You will have to reapply after each washing. All it does is repels moisture and keeps the item from staining.
It will help protect it but the fabric will still stain. It helps but doesn't not fully protect. Make sure you spray down throughly.
Yes

The fabric is thin but under any pair of pants gives me a nice warmth for 32 degrees F. without making the over pair of pants uncomfortable or tight. Probably would not be warm enough for Alaska winters which can get 50 below.
Best to say they are a second skin. We have had 26 degree temps, but I haven't been out for more than 30 min. They don't make you warm & fuzzy, you would need heavier thermals. I find I can wear them even to work, helping get to & from the car & not overheating me while indoors. Hope that answers the question.
They have a loose fit. If you want them to fit like panty hose, order a size or two down.
I would say that XL would fit someone up to about 190 lbs. and up to about 5'8"... I am 5'7" and 160 and they were a bit long.
82 grams
I went to their website(Terramar)....... It has a sizing chart indicating various measurements.
They didn't chaff on me, but I did not ride a bike. They are like pantyhose, just slightly heavier.
Hi Matt I think Meggie is right, but for the record these are the sizes of the packaging mine came in. Small- 19.5 to 23.0 Medium- 23.5 to 27.5 Large- 27.0 to 31.5 These are the Mondo sizes used to measure ski boots and there should be a size on your boots. PS Don't know where you live but I ordered my my Amazon USA and they were delivered to UK in no time. Stormin
I would say no as they are a tight fit to ski boots where snow board boots are much wider. However I am sure dry guy have other solutions for inside the boot no matter ski or snow board.
Yes, they could because those are more normal size shoes. If someone wants to use these on Alpine ski boots by a larger size then what you think you need.
They are unisex, I wear a size 7 shoe and the Medium fit my ski boots.....My husband is wearing the large.
As of Nov 25-2011 this URL had the sizing. http://www.dryguy.net/BootGlove.html
See below for U.S. men's boot sizing information: Small fits boot sizes 3 - 6 / mondo sizes 19.5 - 23 Medium fits boot sizes 7 - 11 / mondo sizes 23.5 - 27.5 Large fits boot sizes 11 - 15 / mondo sizes 27 -31.5 Got that info on the REI website..
Depends on boot size. You need the size of ...mine was a 26 found on the boot sole , so I brought a medium as designated by the sizing chart. Ends up that they didn't fit property. Sent back and got a large and they ended up too large. Still have them. Used a pair before and found them to protect a little bit better without them.

Mine is a polarized TWO pronger.
No, it doesn't fold down. Though it doesn't require the stand that holds it up right, as I have mine mounted on a wall. You could probably fit the stand and shoe dryer in a snow board bag separately.
Yes
Yes. My kids use it regularly for their goalie gloves. Works great.
Not sure why you would use it on sandals but if your worried about it melting them, it shouldn't. It doesn't get that hot.
If you buy it from Amazon, you can return or exchange.
Yes works with most boots this was used in Chicago and used with snow boots and works well.. also it stood over the heater vent perfectly so they dried even faster.
The cord reads 6A, 120VAC. There is no mention of 240.

I have walked several miles wearing grips much of the distance on bare concrete or blacktop. I guess the grips will wear out after a lot of use but I feel very safe walking on ice while wearing them. Actually I have several pair and never leave home without them during the winter.
I haven't tried to replace any spikes. I buy a new pair when I have lost any spikes, I find that they are so low in cost.I just buy another pair.
small
Yes, there is defintiely noise when you walk with them indoors but it's not terribly loud. but you do click and clack. I guess I wouldn't recommend wearing them indoors as it will wear down the points that grip into the ice and snow. They are easy to slip on and off so there really wouldn't be a reaon to wear them inside ~:)
I have used them since Christmas and I have walked across my linoleum floor countless times. No damage, and no damage to the concrete.
I wear a women's size 7 shoe. I bought these Grip-Ons to wear on Lands' End All-Weather Mocs, which are quite bulky. I had to go to a Grip-On size L, which is designed for women's sizes 10.5-13! These things are great, by the way!
This should help, I found sizing on a different site Grip-Ons Sizes: Medium: Men's 5.5 - 7 or Women's 6 - 10 Large: Men's 7.5 - 10 or Women's 10.5 - 13 X-Large: Men's 10.5 - 13 or Women's 13.5 - 16
Yes, they are safe to wear anywehre ...they aer not going to get stuck in anything. But like I wore them to the store one day and it can get a bit slippery on a linoleumor tile floor with those metal cleats.
i wear a size 10 narrow work boot. I got a large. Just enough stretch to cover the sole. Perfect fit.

I am not sure of the size but I know that it is a little snug on my husband's wrist. He did mention he wished it was a bit bigger. I hope this helps.
It is not water-resistant. Instructions say so.
I have not seen that problem at all....the watch is to remind my husband to urinate every 4 hours and it has not missed a beat since he started using it.
I think you can. I accidently pushed the letters during programming and they come up on my 10:00 alarm. I never bothered to erase them. The company also has a website where it tells you how to program the watch. It is step by step instructions. This watch is the best I have found. I wish you luck.
This watch is the ladies' verson. At this time this is the only one we carry.
Because it doesn't have the vibrating alarms needed for deaf people. If you can't hear the beeps, it's useless. Hope that helps.
12.8 cm (5.0") between the widest two points; 5.1 cm (2.0") "tall"
Very well. These are great.
Blocks 99% UVB and 60% UVA.
At this time we carry only the green color.
I bought them for my husband. He says they are polarized.
The inside dimensions of my large roller bag are: 20inL x 10inW x 13inD. This fits my Viking Designer 1 with the case on. My other bag (the one shown on top in the picture) is 18.5inL x 5inW x 16inD. It fits the embroidery unit with the machine perfectly!
I don't know the color but mine weren't the same color when I got them and the handle on the big one was broken. I would not order them again.
what are the inside dimensions of the "sewing machine bag"?
30 inches.
I have mine on tile, I think it would be ok on a short carpet, not sure how well it would roll? But think it would be ok. I wouldn't call the color yellow, it is a fake distressed look, so the white is ivory, but there is a pine colored faux wood showing through which probably has caused people to label the color as yellow.
The width of mine sewing armoire is 32" with the double doors closed, and 61" from the top of the decorative molding to the bottom of the floor. The door louvers are decorative only. The width would be the same if you removed the doors (which would be easy to do) for an "open" access option. Oops. See addendum in comment below :&gt;)
The table on the cabinet fits into the cabinet on metal sliders hinges in the middle as a drop down; and the entire front of the table then "drops" down to cover the inside front so the doors can be closed over it. I have used the "lift" part as a shorter table by pulling out the part underneath that has rollers on it to the extent that I need. I have two smaller (sewing & serger) machines that I can fit comfortably on either side of the drop down part now used as a shorter table. When I place my heavier full size embroidery machine on it, I extend it all the way out for safety and glance at the roller feet to make sure that machine vibration has not moved them out of position in any way.
The area where your sewing machine sets when the doors are closed measures 30.5" wide 16" deep and 13" high. If your machine is not larger than this, it will fit.
It should. The lower shelf would have to be at its lowest height to take into account the height of the machines. It should easily hold a serger and a sewing machine. The second sewing machine could be stored on the pullout table. This is what I do. However, since my sewing machine is relatively tall, I have to take off the spools when I slide the table inwards when I close up the unit. The little, adjustable shelves hold my sewing basket and things like patterns and scissors for easy access. There is some limited space for fabric - probably enough for one or two ongoing projects.
yes it is the full width
Hi there - all you will need are screwdrivers, wrenches, and from memory (I assembled mine a year ago), possibly a drill. Tool - wise it is very straightforward. Good luck
I only comes is Antiqued white, which is an off white with distressing running through it.
No
If you are sweating then yes it will. I wear it running when the rain is heavy and I get pretty clammy. But I think all waterproof jackets would do that. There are armpit vents so that can help.
No, it doesn't have a double zipper.
There is a bit of a lining. I don't find it sticky or uncomfortable at all, but I understand the concern. I think the lining (very light and only partial) makes the difference, but it all depends on how high your tolerance is for polyester rain jackets in general.
I have and it's wonderful! I have never gotten wet wearing this jacket. I love this jacket because it's not heavy and not hot to wear in the Summer...perfect for Spring, Fall, and Summer.
I think it does...I expected it to run small but it fits very well. I'm 5'5", weigh about 170, wear a size 12 pants, and size large shirt. I got the XL jacket because I hate tight jackets and this one is perfect!
I own three of these Marmot jackets. I wipe mine down with a damp cloth.
What numbers are you talking about?
It doesn't pack into itself but it packs nicely, flat and did not wrinkle when folded like a shirt in my overstuffed suitcase
Depends on how you want it to fit and what you are going to use it for. I am 5 3/4 and 135 pounds. I ordered a small and it fits fine if I am wearing only a shirt and maybe a sweatshirt and / or want to be fashionable and look feminine. However, I bought it for because it was recommended as lite weight for hiking.
It is not stiff as it is a lightweight but waterproof jacket.
Yes, yes it is my friend.
Here is the updated size chart from ExOfficio: http://www.exofficio.com/customer-service/sizing
Yes
No they do not, they stay pretty much where they should be, comfortable and they breath not like the cotton.....
Extremely durable, way more than any standard cotton boxerbriefs. I've never had to take special care
Yes
Per item
I'm basically the same build as you, I wear medium comfortably.
I wish I knew how to shrink mine. I've tried hot water but nothing seems to work. That's certainly a sign of a quality made garment when it can hold up to hot water and the dryer. I'll begin purchasing a smaller size in the future.
Mine didn't but I washed and dried them on the "delicate" cycle setting
Yes, yes it is my friend.

There is just one pair per package.
38-40
I find the fit to be good. They have excellent stretch. I wear Medium and waist size is 31.
Better living through chemistry!
that is my understanding
32-34 according to the REI sizing chart for ExOfficio underwear
I would go with the large. I wear a 36.to 38 and the xl is a great fit
I'd consider the boxer briefs in place of these, Paul. These aren't too baggy, but I wear suits to work and sometimes these inch their way up in to the danger zone. It's not much of an issue though, because they're so light weight and comfortable. Nonetheless, I'd say play it safe and get the boxer briefs instead.
In my experience they fit true to size
i have xl but don't think it will work for xxxls.
Yes, yes it is my friend.

I ordered them and they are a boy's size. If you want adult sizes you'll have to look elsewhere.
I would say no. I have slender legs and the medium pants and they are a bit tight... but they're supposed to be tight and give some compression. The compression helps with muscular stamina because your muscles are not shaking and vibrating from your movements. And I'd also recommend trimming your leg hair (if a man is wearing them) cause the compression and material will chaf and rub your skin and hair.
Yes they do. It's on the inside of the waistband
Yes
I wear them hiking but not to the gym. Other do wear them in the gym. My girlfriend wears her's everywhere
the size was very true, I ordered as normal and they fit perfect
I don't know about "infrared technology", but these under a set of zip-away hiker pants keep me warm at the campsite at the Grand Canyon and Tonto National Forest in AZ high country, up into November Temps.
Allison, i bought the cold gear for winter months in N.C....I have used it only once so far and it keeps me very warm with only my lite realtree camo over it. I'ts good for temps 55 and lower if that will help you decide? Happy Hunting
I used them under BDU pants when riding my Ducati Motorcycle in cold weather and they work better then long johns cause they breath but keep the heat in. The weather was in the 40's with the wind chill while riding. Not sure about 20s though.
No, they are youth. I bought them for my 7 year old son.
First two drawers have dividers, first one has 6 little compartments and the second drawer has 4 compartments.
The top draw is divided into 1/4 's, the first has slots for your rings, it will fit about 15, another 1/4 has 2 small lined boxes, and the other 1/2 has 2 larger sections. The next draw has 9 lined small sections, the next draw has 4 sections, and the rest of the draws are just lined graduating in depth. The sides open to have 4 hooks on each side. It is very pretty , but small for anyone that has over than 8 necklaces and 15 rings. I hope this helps.
each side has 5 but I overloaded it and it fell so now I have to reglue it but I'm thinking of fixing it myself with some screws and hinges on the outside I love it though
All the hardware and drawer pulls that are needed are included in the box.
Assembly is easy. The roses are definitely pink.
I don't have it here in front of me but the dimensions given are 17"L x 12"W x 39 1/2"H. This, however, is confusing, and I believe it should say 17" across and 12" deep (outer dimensions). And the drawers are approximately 10-11" deep inside. I hope this helps.
The roses are varying shades of pink. From a dark rose to a pale pink. And very nicely done.
I bought this for my mother in 2009 (and she loved it) and I believe the color in the picture here is fairly accurate. I can't be sure that they're still making it the same.
Yes, this has several sizes of divided drawers one of which is small sections for rings or earrings.
VERY, very easy. 5 minutes.
Medium is men's size 9-11. I use them on my boots and sneakers and I'm a 9.5.
To get sizing, go to their website, choose a style, and click on the "SIZING" button. It gives US&Euro Men/Women sizes and recommended Yaktrax size. www.yaktrax.com
I would say small since I wear 8 and a half and I use medium.
My husband is a size 13 shoe and he said he had a hard time getting them on. He'd be cautious about a recommendation. Me, on the other hand, think it's worth a try. Great product. Good Luck
That is right in the center of their recommended range of shoe sizes fitted by Yaktrax size small, according to Yaktrax web site. I found their sizing recommendations work well for me.
I think you need a wide and long footprint that snow shoes have, to be in the deep snow... Yak trax are good in an inch or two of snow or ice
You buy a size small. Size small fits women's 6.5-10. Hope that this helps.
I would suggest a size Medium. Remember Yaktrax are for walking ONLY on snow or icey surfaces. YAKTRAX NEED TO BE REMOVED BEFORE WALKING ON TILE OR OTHER SIMILAR SURFACES.
X-Small:...Men's sizes 1 - 4.5...Women's sizes 2.5 - 6 Small:...Men's sizes 5 - 8.5...Women's sizes 6.5 - 10 Medium:...Men's sizes 9 - 11...Women's sizes 10.5 - 12.5 Large:...Men's size 11.5 - 13.5...Women's sizes 13 - 15
Mine came as a set. They are nice.
That size is out of stock now. Check back in a week.
No it doesn't. Just on the front under the logo. Glock written in silver on left sleeve.
No collar.
You are in luck.....i ordered two sets by mistake and have a pair in my hand. The sticker on the side says it fits, 3 3/4" hole, 3/8" drain. Hope this helps
we just have the item Hole &#65306;3.77" Thank you
I think you can order as many as you need and the "bulk" purchase is the reason for the lower price.
Dear Customer, To provide a more accurate answer to your question, we have to take this to our warehouse. We will bring you updates soon. Thanks for your interest and question about our product. Have a nice day. Customer Service: Ellie
I don't remember the exact size. But, it was the standard size used in most boats (mine is a Bumble Bee). Was actually better than the factory cup because of the large lip at the top.
17 x 4 x 12.5 inches This size is pretty accurate. And does expand that extra inch.
It looks like the pockets are stitched to a large felt covered insert, but the insert itself is probably glued to the inside front cover. I cannot tell what kind of material is underneath the vinyl.
It comes with the default combination of 000.
Interior = 17" X 12". I have a 17" Dell that does fit.
No shoulder strap but is every bit as good as the $59.00+ varieties I saw in the stores.
No, there is no shoulder strap, it is only hand held.
Yes. All "0"
Yes
CHINA
Theoretically you can, if you keep the combinations set at 000, 000. Unfortunately if the dials move whatsoever while in transit, they're would be no way for your friend to decifer how to get the code back to 000, 000 without some assistance. I would avoid the combination lock for your friend if possible.
Yes, it comes with a sturdy strap. I don't know what the load capability of the strap is (that would need to be answered by the manufacturer) but I usually have my bag loaded with a lot of books, folders, and 2 binders. It is pretty heavy and the strap handles the weight with no issues. However, my bag is so heavy that it hurts my shoulder so I have taken the strap off and just carry it by hand.
None that I know of. Same thing happened to me. Would not recommend this item
Should work but this bag is soft all over and does not stand alone - it props or leans.
Yes I'm happy with mine
small is 27-31 ", medium is 31-35 ", large is 35-39 ". Short inseam is 26 1/2-29 1/2", regular is 29 1/2-32 1/2", long is 32 1/2" to 35 1/2". Same as military duty unifrom standards.
Battle Dress Uniform
The atacs fg bdu's I ordered was was the xl-longs I usually wear a 38in waist with 34in lenth these pants have plenty of room in the waist and the lenth was pretty long on me I'd say they are 36"-37" so if you order the longs you shouldn't have a problem there is a sizing chart some where on there website. Hope this helps.. I love mine
an extra large should fit from 38"-42" waist, there are adjustment tabs at the 4 and 8 o'clock positions.
33 waist is Medium. 34 length I would go with a long. So Medium/Long
My husband is the same size and I ordered the Medium Regular. They fit.
XLL (long) or XLR (regular).
65% poly-35% cotton
Technically one is slightly darker than other but they looked same to me after much washing & wearing
large regular if possible large short
yes it's adjustable
it is plastic all around... i love it! accidentally put it in the washer and dryer... and it still works! lol
No, it has a step second hand.
Each side of the wristband is 4". Hope that helps :)
not sure what exactly your question is. but the watch is execellent . gives military time which is great when charting and gives you less to try and figure out. water resistant and also has a warranty
Unfortunately not.
Cc , I would say 1 inch x 1 inch. I have use this watch at work and love it. I've also received so many compliments on it !
THE CLASP IS ALSO WHITE
The shorts ran very true to size. My daughter is 7 and the L (size 6-8) is perfect. She is about 62 pounds though, has a little thicker build. I would buy the same size he wears in pants.
Well I would say they are as stretchy as the usual adult cycling shorts, the material is somewhat thick and it is a proper cycling short not of those cheap stretchy soft light shorts.
Yes they did. My son was a 6-7 and they fit nicely.
yes they run skinny
Yes, I believe so. My son is 11 and has the zeta large.
My daughter is 4'9 and 80lbs. She wears a youth large.
Probably 10-12 may be little big but not much if at all
yes my granddaughter is also 50 pounds and they fit
The shorts are padded, served our kids well on tandem & tag-a-long. Just like typical adult shorts.
The shorts ran very true to size. My daughter is 7 and the L (size 6-8) is perfect. She is about 62 pounds though, has a little thicker build. I would buy the same size he wears in pants.
Well I would say they are as stretchy as the usual adult cycling shorts, the material is somewhat thick and it is a proper cycling short not of those cheap stretchy soft light shorts.
Yes they did. My son was a 6-7 and they fit nicely.

Not that I know of. I wipe it down after each use...especially to make sure I don't have any stones that came loose. That happened once. Fault of the setting not the machine!
Yes you can and I was making a vitamin C potion in it when it broke after about the 6 time and there was no manufacturer's paperwork included to return it to or warranty. I was left with throwing it in the trash after about 2 months use. You would be making a big mistake buying this item.
It doesn't come with a smaller basket, but you can get a steel mesh container that will fit inside and it will work.
Gabby, Mine came with instructions. You may be able to go online and download the info. I really love my machine--it has made my jewelry sparkle like new!
yeah it is... and an other one or two other types of stands are included.
Yes the heater can be turned off or on during the run cycle without unplugging it. Heater is activated by pushing the center button. A light around the button indicates when it is on or off.
I no longer have this item. It failed after about 4 or 5 cycles and I returned it and purchased the Kendal Industrial Grade 160 Watts 2.5 Liters Digital Heated Ultrasonic Cleaner and it is still working. http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018IIPFK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
I bought it and the motor wen out on it the first time I used it. I do not recommend it to anyone, although It may have just been a lemon. I was so frustrated with it I didn't bother to return it I just threw it in the trash can and ordered another brand.
I don't see any adjustable setting, so I will assume it is preset.
Made in China. I had no problem with the English instructions. I've had mine for a few years now. I only use it occasionally. I've never had a problem with it. Whatever kind you buy, make sure it has a heater. The heater makes a big difference.
I ordered a size medium. I have a 32/33 waist and an inseam of about 32" the length is perfect, comes just below my ankles, the waist is snug, I am 6ft tall and weigh abound 155 lbs. The product didn't seem to shrink at all after washing in warm water and drying on medium heat. My only complaint is they are made in china. But isn't almost everything made in china?
Just search for "Minus 33 tall"
I like a pair of boxer briefs under them. I wear them multiple days at times so seems like a good idea to have a extra layer.
I'd say 2X, I'm fairly similar, except I usually wear 30 length, and I've got room left in the leg. I think you'll be fine with 2XL.
Hi Martha, I'm about 5'-10" and 180lbs (many of those lbs are in my tummy area, unfortunatley) and I went with the Medium and they fit perfectly, so I would venture that a size SM would do the trick - you do want them tight if they're going to be worn as a base layer.
I've used polypro in the Marines, but for skiing they're pretty thick, unless you find some that are thin. And I believe you'll want something thin to wick away moisture and excess heat while skiing. Matter of fact, 2 years after active duty, (1999) I did some training with a reserve unit and we went cross country skiing - believe it or not. It was so cold, but the only thing they let us wear was our skivvy tops and bottoms under our gortex...because the skiing was going to heat us up and it did (this was in Grayling, MI and it goes down to the teens; add wind and you're at ~10. now in 2004 and 2005, I went snowboarding with my friends, and I had no thermals on that I could remember. Both trips were freezing cold in Petosky MI. I just had snowboarding pants, wool/blend boarding socks, and regular skivvies. And I was fine, never overheated, b/c the pants had venting zippers - or whatever. Oh yeah, the sun was a big help too. If you're going to ski as incessantly as possible, and you're going to wear snow pants (I assume are insulated), I'd wear something thin underneath. If you're going to only wear gortex in ~10F weather, then polypro might be the ticket. Another thing too. One thing our corpsman told us about polypro, is that you can overheat in them. One thing I've heard about wool from reliable sources, you won't overheat. Polypro is breathable, but will hold heat and won't let go - hence overheating. Wool on the hand is thinner and more breathable, so it can let go of unwanted heat from all the skiing you want to do; and still keep you warm. Hope this helps. So my best guess at ~10F = snow pants + thin wool.
He will not be cold wearing Merino wool. They are extremely warm without being "Bulky".
There is no sizing chart that we could find, but my husband is a 40 waist and the XL fits perfectly... hope that helps.
I'm 6'1" and the mediums fit me perfectly. I'm a skinny to athletic build. My normal pants size is 30-32 waist and 33 length. Hope this helps you. Peace, LtitleBear
I also have a 34 at 5.9 and the pair I got are very long. Barring any manufacturing irregularities they should fit you just fine.. The waist is a bit tight though but that could be because of layering..? I got the Large but the XL would have been better around the waist.

It depends on how snug you want them. I'm a 33" and ordered the large. If I had to reorder, I would get an XL.
I am a 34" and 6'1" and they were a little snug and short, but wore them anyway, which was a mistake. After the first wash in cold water and flat drying, they shrunk. I passed them down to my wife, who is 5'7', and they fit her well. Don't let anyone tell you different, because they shrink so buy a little bigger. Other than that, they are great high quality and warm in -5 degree weather under blue jeans at a Green Bay Packer game. I will buy another XL now.
Yes, machine washing and drying has not been a problem.
I'm 35x34, L is about 2 inches short for me, I think L would fit you, if not a little longer.
I would recommend a large.
I would go with the medium. I have a 34 waist and the large was just right. the length should not be an issue due to the elastic binding at the ankles.
Yes. I can wear mine under a flight suit or utility trousers but not under standard-fit pants like jeans.
how well do you tolerate cold? not well get heavy weight, well get lighter weight.

It has a safety pin
The badge itself is a heavy metal material, but as I mentioned in my review, the pin is somewhat flimsy. It still worked for me though. Did not fall apart.
I used to be a police officer and other than it saying "special" on it instead of the town name it is as real as the one I used to wear. The metal construction is well done.
Many sellers offer expedited shipping, our expedited service is USPS Priority which is a 2-3 day service and we ship same or next business day.
It has a safety pin on the back of it that holds up pretty well.
I would say it was probably 2" X 3" to 2 1/2" x 3 1/2". It is not in my possession so I am trying to remember.
no there's no cartridge, it does make powder "puffs" of "smoke" but it doesn't smell.
Yes you can, just dont blow too hard cause you will blow the cigarette out the holder..lol
I have placed my puff cigarettes in an ashtray for an effect. I collect ashtrays. I have found that they are very realistic looking and the puff happens when you push air into the filter. When you do this, it looks like the cigarette is actually lit. When in the ashtray, a glow shows on the ash end. So yes, I would say they are reusable.
Mine didn't really work either...I was disappointed. It's probably flour or something.
Two
They are meant for a one time prop, but I did save one for a photo booth prop (the other was chewed). They both lasted throughout the party, while being in the mouth nearly the entire time.
One
Yes, it does.
According to the information on this watch the countdown range is from 1 minute to 100 hours.
I don't know yet. I've had it for 6 months, it's my bang around watch, so I haven't treated it lightly, but it looks and runs like new. It's been great so far.
You can record until 200 BPM. But if you want to measure the pace while you running, you need a polar o garmim watch.
Mine doesn't have a step counter.
No it doesn't. It's really very basic and mostly measures time and laps.
I got the women's version of this watch for my small 11-year-old girl and it fits her just fine.
mmm the case its that a cube of 4.9 x 3.2 x 2.2 inches, are very small
The top left back is a square where I put pins. There is a lot of room to stack. The front left is a rectangle with an attached cover where I keep 2 watches. The top right front can fit about 20 rings in 2 rows more or less depending upon how large they are. A wide ring might not fit but you could store it in one of the other areas. Top right in the back has holes to store earring with posts (There is a removable divider just in case you do not have post earrings.). I use that area for some narrow bracelets since on the right is a pull out draw that has 12 compartments where I store earrings; it also could be used for rings. To the left of the 12 compartment draw is a narrow rectangle that pulls out for whatever else you might want. The draw below pulls out and is a large rectangle where I keep bracelets and some necklaces. Below that is another pull out drawer divided into 4 sections where I also keep longer earrings and some matching necklaces. The lowest pull out drawer is divided into two rectangles in the front and one larger one in the back. Again, long necklaces, earrings or bracelets. There are 2 doors that snap closed that have 5 hooks on each side that hold a total of 10 necklaces (If you are neat about it, you might hang 2 necklaces from one hook.). I hang delicate chains on these so they do not tangle. In the mirrored top area is an elastic pocket for added storage. If that is not enough, there is a small removable box for travel or more storage. It has 3 hooks, a small elastic pocket, a small area to push in 3-4 rings and a removable divider for 3 post earring or remove divider for larger earrings or whatever you want. Finally, I use the front flap to lay my jewelry for the work day. All of the areas have a suede-like covering to help prevent scratches. I really love this jewelry box since I can keep everything in one area. Nothing gets tangled and there is less chance of losing pieces because I immediately put the jewelry in the box after work or a weekend event. I hope that this helps you and you too enjoy this item.
If they aren't too bulky, one of the drawers will hold 2.
To be honest, I just received it last weekend. I will send an answer soon. My jewelry has been in it since Sunday evening. If any discoloration is found I will send a redponse. I wish that I had an answer now. God bless.
Yes it is. My wife loves it
It did come with a simple key, but it was not required to open it when I received mine. I believe the key was easy to find, but cannot recall whether it was on the top of the box or inside. I would not call it a "high security" key, though.
Its attached to the handle then what you do with it I dont know..wife loves it
I think just one. I forgot where I put mines..
Gold as described
the ring section is fairly small. it is divided into two parts and will hold 10 rings each.I am sure it will work for other jewelry, but it will not hold a lot of anything.
It's synthetic leather
I found them to be quite true to size.
I wouldn't consider them water resistant but would consider the Tango Thong very water tolerable. In wearing mine, they sometimes get wet but always dry without drawbacks like shrinkage or staining. When my Tango Thongs need cleaning due to perspiration or just plan dirt I float them upside down in the swimming pool for a day and then let them air dry in the sun. I hope this answer helps and if you're on the fence about getting a pair of these, go ahead and get them. They are the best and most versatile flops out there. Jimmy
Made In China
Up. Better for a shoe to be bigger than smaller unless you can get them in larger width then go one half down. Example. If you wear 10 and it isn't offered a 9 1/2 wide will work.

Yes, my husband is 4x and it fits him
Yes I am 6 2 and these strike me right above the knee. Just perfect and I just completed a Marathon in them this past Sunday. I've no regrets in buying them!
I am 32 waste and bought them in Medium. They fit perfect, caution (see through) but great fit and very comfortable!
I'm 6'2" with 32" inseam & 40" waist. These fit very well and reach my knees. No idea what the compression strength is.
yeah they are very long, they are almost see through though, so dont plan on wearing them as primary shorts.
Stromgren Compression shorts are 75% Nylon and 25% Spandex, They are the best compression shorts I've ever had. Thank you.
Hi Alina, Stromgren Compression shorts are suitable for men and women. After trying many different so called compression shorts none compare to Stromgren. There light, breathable, and holds all your muscles in place during vigorous workouts or running. They also come in different colors and lengths, and Amazon sells them at a great price. I strongly recommend them.
I don't know, but usually I ware underware size M and this fits me excellent (by pressing of course)
Inseam is 12 inches. I am 6'2' and 300 pounds. 4XL regular adjusts from 51 to 55 inches easily. It has a 5/8 inch "draw tape" wide band to adjust the waist from snug to loose. I use a couple camping things that you adjust cords with for each side of the pants. As far as man or woman... I don't think it matters on camo?? One thing for sure is they are sturdy. If you know how to replace zippers, they may last quite some time as the seams do not rip etc. It is very well made. Hope this helps...Cheers
When I initially bought these, I was a 40/42, as well. The XL seemed to measure in at 36/38, which was very disappointing as I thought they would have been baggy. Typically (in my experience), XXL translates to 42/44 or larger, but definitely not in this case. I just checked my review and for the life of me, I cannot remember writing that review!! I think I might need to contact Amazon because I thought I sent those shorts back for being WAY too small. Also, I think that the inseam might be around 9" and I've typically worn 11", but have bought some 7" inseam shorts, which are a little too short. :-) Hope this helps! Others on their reviews say that the fit is a little big; I don't think that's right, but I'll have to look into my wardrobe when I get home.
If your looking for vintage shorts these aren't for you. They don't have a distressed or prewashed looked. On the upside they are much larger than the picture in length and makes for a great pair of cargo shorts.
I bought these in 2XL, and the inseam ends at my knees.
most likely should be a nice fit
Men's
If you're a genuine 38 I would order the XL instead. I'm a 42 and the XXL fits comfortably. Hope this helps.
My husband is a 36/38 I ordered a size large which fit him perfectly.
Hi Peter. I never used this garment bag to travel afterall but I still have the two I bought. I took one corner of the bag and ran it under the faucet water for about 1 minute and reversed the bag and did it on the other side. When I unzipped it and ran my hand inside the corner it was completely dry. Not sure if this is a good test but the water seemed to run off and not be absorbed. Hope this helps.
It has only one zipper, however, the zipper pull is at the top when closed. You might be able to lock the zipper pull to the hanger.
I have no idea. I never noticed that. But I'm well satisfied with my bag.
No
Carry on would be fine. Depending on how you pack, it may need to go in the overhead compartment.
You could put a laptop in one of the two main compartments, but it wouldn't be very snug like a dedicated sleeve.
We have a different design but we find the bag is water repellant for drizzle and light to moderate rain but Not 100% waterproof.
Mine, has it!.
This is the second Big Student Backpack in our family. My daughter's was purchased more than a year ago and is holding up great to the demands of college textbooks. These are the only backpacks we buy now because they are well made and carry a ton.
The JanSport website would provide you with clearer information as to which of the packs come with an iPad sleeve. None of the JanSport packs that we carry contain an iPad sleeve.
I guess it's good for your laptop and some books but definitely not for a weekend trip kind of bag,it has many pockets but not so much room as it may seem on the pics
Our laptops are 15.3 inches and put that in backpack for size and it plenty of room and some to spare. Our best guess is that the 17.3 would fit too.
Yes there is some padding in the back panel of this back pack.
no headphone port

Sorry I really don't know. I am 4' 11" and weight 180. I got a extra large. I hope that might help, but you might check with the seller.
Gathered elastic
at the waist for the person I bought them for.
Sorry. I really can't answer that one. I just got the XL and they fit me fine and are very comfortable. I do believe they are 4 different sizes and other that size I would assume they are the same.
Hmmm, maybe large. These pants are great and made in usa I think. I am 5'7", 145, and I have to be very careful that the XL doesn't shrink !!! They have a small concept of large and extra large.
I am a size 8-10 and have bought the small/medium and the medium/large... and they do not sag with my size...they are 90% cotton and 10% spandex...I'm not sure if they would on such a small size. I have had mine for awhile now and not experienced any sagging or loss of spandex yet-they are still snug. Sorry I couldn'tbe of more help. I do know I would buy again... Good luck!
I just measured them... About 28 or 28-1/2"
About 28 or 28-1/2"
I did not keep these because of the way the fabric felt- I am sure they would Held llint because they had a fuzzy hand feel
I'm only 5'2, but my daughter who stole them from me is around 5'5. They're more than long enough for her, but the XL is more of a size 10-12 American sizing rather than the usual standard XL American sizes of 16-18. They appeared to be about the same length of the American Apparel leggings I usually buy, which ARE long enough for a 34 inseam, but I'm not sure. Sorry!
Sorry I really don't know. I am 4' 11" and weight 180. I got a extra large. I hope that might help, but you might check with the seller.
Gathered elastic
at the waist for the person I bought them for.
Sorry. I really can't answer that one. I just got the XL and they fit me fine and are very comfortable. I do believe they are 4 different sizes and other that size I would assume they are the same.
Hmmm, maybe large. These pants are great and made in usa I think. I am 5'7", 145, and I have to be very careful that the XL doesn't shrink !!! They have a small concept of large and extra large.
I am a size 8-10 and have bought the small/medium and the medium/large... and they do not sag with my size...they are 90% cotton and 10% spandex...I'm not sure if they would on such a small size. I have had mine for awhile now and not experienced any sagging or loss of spandex yet-they are still snug. Sorry I couldn'tbe of more help. I do know I would buy again... Good luck!

its a stretch band but it is considered a medium which for large guys like myself is not enough so i had to buy an after market band which works fine.
The WT-967s in 25 link, 6 3/4 inch band which may be big for a woman. However, the band can be changed with another band as is it only held in by spring pins. A Jeweler may charge $5-10 plus the band or may do it for free.
I bought a generic band and it works just fine. Yes the band that comes with the watch is considered a medium which for us larger guys doesnt help much.
From having tried the Medium and Large versions of this vest, I would say the sizes that Domke uses is the same as typical size metrics. I wear a medium shirt, and the medium vest fits me well. Given what it is, it still has plenty of room to fit over jackets and whatnot, but if I wear just the vest, it has the same looseness as a medium shirt in the chest region (the lower portion is baggier of course). Large was larger than I felt was necessary. The medium works for me even over a winter coat.
I think a man's small would work; very nice vest.
Hello, we do not stock that quantity, but we can get them in 3 to 5 days. To coordinate purchase through Amazon please contact us at 1-800-900-6676. Thanks.
The size says large.
Assuming I've understood you, there are no epaulettes on this item. The shoulders are undecorated.
we have it in stock. thank you.
Well, I usually use a medium in shirts, jackets, etc., but I bought one of these in medium a year ago, and it is just too baggy. Yes, it does have a lot more room that way, I suppose, but I'm now in the market for a small. So, the short answer to your question is, I think they run a bit big. By the way, I'm 5'7", 160 lbs.
To be honest, not sure about the actual style as this is our fantasy football traveling trophy, but I will say it has a subtle mad hatter flair to it. If you want pictures of someone wearing it email me at mattmcdon11@gmail.com. hope that helps...
I do not believe so.
Bottom to top it is 7" tall
It can be clipped on any kind of glasses. I bought this for my uncle who uses prescription glasses while driving too and and he is happy with it.
Hey there, I have been using the eagle eyes clip-ons and have not scratched my lenses. There are rubberized tips on the clips to prevent damage to your lenses.
Yes they should clip on thick frames, the clips are just like any other sun glasses. The big difference is when you put them on. I use mine everytime I get in my car, cloudy or sunshine you will see better.
2"X 5.25"
I just spoke to the Customer service desk at Eagle Eyes, he stated that the lenses ARE polarized which agrees with the product description on eagleeyes.com. Eagle eyes do make non-polarized glasses but these are not one of them.
I bought a pair of these glasses online, and they do block uv and blue light and generaly help you see clearer, but the rectangular shape and small dimensions of the sunglasses are not mentioned by the seller or made clear in the picture. The dimensions of the glasses are approximately: 55 mm (just over 2 in.) for each lens at the top tapering down to about 45 mm or less at the bottom. The "bridge" width is about 17 mm. Each lens is rather small and useless for round or roundish glasses. The total lenth of about 127 mm (about 5 in.) is rather small also. There are of course persons whose glasses fit these dimensions, but the sunglasses dimensions are not described for those whose glasses don't fit these dimensions. To sum up: these are great clip ons but be aware of the tiny size and irregular dimensions
Yes
Not sure haven't been in any rain only snowLOL
No, it doesn't. But the top straps may work to put through a handle.
Absolute piece of junk everything thing has fallen appart
Has individual sections to hold up to 17"+ laptop plus much more.
The largest you can find. My husband is 5'2 and 140 pounds. He got a medium.
I'm 5'8 190 #'s I went with a medium. If you need it skin tight, try a small. The medium will have a little play.
Like it was painted on!

I did not get this item yet. It has been over a month. What a joke
Look up the ColdGear, it traps heat...The HeatGear will actually make it feel colder.
XL should fit.
They run small on the compression ones .. But my man is a lil bigger I got him a 2xx .. When it arrived I thought wow that's small but he put it on and fit great .. I would go with a 2xx
I would get a large
Im 6'1" and 250lbs and the Xl is a good fit on me
Hello, I did not think so, they might need a little breaking in but I did not have any problems bowling with them, but I am not that good eithere. At first I thought they were tight but they actually fit snug but not uncomfortably snug.
The shoes tend to run small. I would suggest ordering a half size larger.
yes, i wish i had gotten 1/2 size larger. they are a little tight on me, but i'm wearing them and they work fine.
I've had mine since late Oct/early Nov of last year. Doing great so far. No rips or tears. The stitching is intact. I will say one pocket runs deeper than the other (intentional in case you have wet things), but aside from that, I love this bag. I still use it.
Yes
When I added this to my cart, it displayed this: "Shopping Cart Items Diadora Team Bag (25"x11"x11 1/2", Royal)- Diadora $9.97" Those dimensions are actually associated with a "Medium" Diadora Team bag at other sites, for instance &lt;http://www.foxsoccershop.com/198330-ro.html&gt;. Btw, I'd tried first on a Google over to the manufacturer's site, but it was just flashkrap with no accessible info. I've decided this isn't a killer buy, despite the markdown -- unless one is specifically a Diadora team fan. It is not that big of a bag, and doesn't have much going on with extra pockets.
It certainly does
I've never flown, so I couldn't answer that question. I've used this bag to carry boxing equipment, baseball equipment, and clothing/shoes. It's pretty big.
I haven't been too rough with mine, but the thing is pretty tough. However, the plastic zippers on the side pockets almost immediately tear off. The main pocket has metal zippers, and those are tough as nails. I've had mine for a bit over a year now, and besides the zippers on the sides coming off within about 2 weeks of purchasing it, it's still as if it's brand new. As long as you don't mind using the side zippers from the metal base that lays on the tracks, this thing probably won't fall apart on you. As far as space goes, I've fit 4 pairs of shorts, 4 shirts, a towel, a blender bottle, a pair of shoes and some miscellaneous hygiene products with a little room to spare.
I can't say for sure. What I can tell you is that I bought this bag for a 16 year old female soccer player. She would take all of her soccer gear plus multiple changes in clothing and make up/ hair stuff etc. It is quite large. The end pockets are made to hold a soccer ball and cleats. So I imagine it would be plenty of room for his shoes. :-)
Water proof? No. Can you put wet clothing in it for a short amount of time sure. What are you planning on doing with it that it needs to be water proof?
I will check tomorrow. I have a tennis racket in my garage. I just use it for a gym bag.

Sorry not sure kilo conversions to pounds. My son is 8. 4ft 7" and 80 pnds. The leg length in the medium was approx 3-4" too long I had to take them in. The top fit was big but that was ok. My son is tall but leg length in these was very long. Hope this helps
I don't know what is the answer, but the medium size is fit to my son. He is 5 yrs old.
more likely not unless hes really thin. my son was 8 when he wore it.

i wear size 10 hiking boot and the medium were to small so i sent them back
My husband can fit a men's 8.5 into a size M overshoe. I would think that should fit your 10B also.
It should. These are "bulky", too much for regular shoes. You should be right on with boots.
The XL fits over size 14-15 shoes.
Men's size 10. I thought I should order a larger size to accommodate boots, but they already accounted for that, and I had to send the size large back for a medium, which works fine.
Gary- For this often asked question you may find an answer by searching other sites for this product. Sometimes reading customer reviews reveals information about size.
I don't think so.
I bought the watch as a gift, so I do not have it here to measure, but the Timex website said the band was 12mm wide and 7.5 inches long. I hope this helps.
Sure but it is soft and plyable and will sting if your're shot in hte face...if you tolerate pain well you can use it in airsoft. This product is meant to use inside of a full face helmet to keep lenses and visors from fogging by sealing the cheeks and bridge of the nose from breath exhale leakage into the eye or visor area.
You can place your order from here or our website directly. We do ship Internationally.
No, the hole should be positioned right under the nostrils for easy breathing, but it should not be visible.
If its cold enough to wear this then u really dont care how u look and if u do dont go out. doesnt cover ears
No, the half mask fits very secure. Love it
The wood that the hoop is made of is quite thin - about 1/8" or 3/16". When you ask how "tall" it is, I assume you are asking the diameter. The diameter of the hoop is 23".
I bought this to make the same thing.. I used 6 white sheers to make mine.. the inside fits inside the outer hoop to hold the sheers in place. So get a bigger one if you need one larger than this. You can't change the actual size by adding two together.
They are stapled and glued and yes they can be removed....I removed mines
Sadly not really l. The dimensions are what they are. It's a pretty sturdy circle.
Diameter. It's a large and fairly sturdy hoop, esp considering the price.
Close to the size of the wand, about 12 in
Hi Karyn! The wands in the Ollivander boxes do not come with a name clip. They were designed to display with the box. The standard collector boxed wands come with a name clip and are often sold in the wand display sets. We hope this helps answer your question! You can always contact our Customer Service team for additional assistance.
No, but it is extremely well made and heavy.
Hi Liberty Trading GB ltd do, can't answer for the other sellers

I tried to levitate a book of mine but it didn't work out well, I guess I was mispronouncing the spell.... or maybe because the wand isn't mine (girlfriend's wand, not meant for me)....
No. It's a replica. Pretty sure a movie prob would cost more money :p
It is made of very sturdy material and not thin in size. We have not had any problems with breakage. It is used by my granddaughter as a wand and she doesn't get overly rough with it. You can get a list online of the different spells you can say and flick your wand a certain way to pretend to be a wizard. The case and wand are very well made and realistic.
Don't be. It's in a seperate box and packaged very well with wrap around it.. It won't be damaged while shipping. It's a great product!
I don't think it is. If you compare it to Hermione's wand in movies 3-7 it is the same. These wands actually have a Warner Brothers Trademark logo on them.
Yes with the lace covering and an authenticity card. Great gift idea.
No, resin, but It feels like wood when you tap it
Yws
yes, but don't hit it on things. It is fragile in that way, but it is sturdy. Gently touch things.
I considered it a brown. I gave it as a present so can't just look at it for you. It is across the country, but it was brown-could have been in the red family though. Remember-all computer monitors are different and unless you have yours set properly color-wise your monitor never shows the true color.
Hello, This is a licensed Harry Potter product, and is of excellent Quality! GamesQuest
Its made in China. Theres a small engraving on the wand that says that.
Yes given they don't smack it on anything.
Yes it is a real replica and can be played with...I would just not pound it on anything.
if you believe, maybe it will:)
Yes.........................................I can't tell you more.
I wouldn't buy them in a larger size. You want them to fit tightly or at least close to the skin so they don't bunch up inside of your pants. You basically want them to fit somewhat like nylons. Mine fit great except for near the ankles but since I wear them only in cold weather I tuck the bottoms in the socks I am wearing.
Mfg.'s label says 100% Polyester. This isn't that old time stuff that pills up. This can be worn as a base layer, and is smooth as silk !
I wear size 32 jeans. Medium Polarmax fits well. The synthetic stretchy fabric makes these very flexible up to a point. The large would fit me but more loosely. Amazon has a very good return policy. If you are in doubt order one of each size, try them on and send back the one that does not fit.
I believe I ordered the same size as underwear. I might have found a size chart there?
The label says 100% made in USA
I was going to ask the same question but I see someone answered yes, they do. Check out the questions section, it's towards the bottom
The pair I have measures approximately 29-30 inches. There is a lot of stretch with the material and the legs generally rest just above my ankles (wool socks). The Polarmax silk weight thermal underwear is a life saver in this frigid weather. I wouldn't leave home without it.
Yes, it has a fly.
I think I run a little smaller than I used to. I'm a size 36 waist now and the extra large is too big. The large fits fine.

I don't know, but the links are much bigger, and stronger than it looks! I was surprised, but it is still very lady like! I bought it for my twelve year old Grand daughter, it was perfect for her, but extra tiny charms are lost in it. Regular size charms are perfect! It is well worth the money! If your looking for a tiny, dainty bracelet, this is not it. This one is made to hold the weight of a lot of charms! I hope this helps you!
I'm not sure, but it's not tiny! It is obviously perfect for a girl/woman. I bought it for my Grandaughter, and was shocked how nice it is for such a low price! It's not flimsy, and after a year now, it's still beautiful! Much better in person than it looks online!
7 inches long
It's not frail..If you dropped it more than likely it won't break. But Lil kid abuse will definitely break it
The one I purchased did not come with a name clip.
Yes this is Dubledore's Wand also known as the Elder Wand. Thank you for your interest in our products.
I believe it's the elder wand. It has the same markings.
I don't believe it did not, but is very nice!
No
It is not interactive. It us just the wand. No bells and whistles or light effects
It's close to 16" long.
We sure do, we ship everywhere! Just place your order and we will dispatch within 24 hours. Hope this helps and please get in touch if you need anymore info. Sally of Retro Styler.
I guess you could play with it to. I have mine on a shelf in my movie room. The one i gave my sister she has on display too. We are both in our 20's so we don't play. We did however take them to Orlando with us when we went to the Harry Potter park.
There isn't one. That's the one thing I don't like about it
Hello Chelsea. I got the small size and it is big enough to have all my gym stuff (shoes, pants, t-shirt, and a bag with hygiene things). I hope this answer help you to decide what you need. :-)
I don't have it with me today but they are listed in the product description, however, you have to scroll down to see it. Product Dimensions: 10 x 18.5 x 11 inches ; 1.4 pounds It's very light and I have plenty of room for shoes, pants, shirt, and way more.
I would say too big... I was using my bag for the gym with a pair of shoes, weights, towels, jacket and a few other small things and it still had a lot of room in it! It's flexible enough that you could easily shove it into a locker if you only had those few things you listed in it. I ended up getting a smaller bag for me to use for the gym.
thats a lot but can see it fitting, gd luck.
yes it is genuine..it had the adidas tags...
Enough to fit at least ten pairs of folds up shorts. I wouldn't suggest it for any vacation packing. Would use it for extra nesesities for the gym
Yes, it is very big and comfortable
I would say yes.
Yes it can
These pouches are way too big for an iPhone, your phone will be bouncing all over the inside unless you stuff it with other things as well. As to sizing, it looks like the belt in question will hold the pouch, the belt loop on the back of the pouch is 3".
Yes definitely without a problem
Yes
Hello, yes, that is a fair measurement
Hi, We do not see that there are any restrictions on shipping this item to Hawaii. Please send us a message via Amazon.com's Buyer-Seller Messages so that we can assist you further. Thank you!
yep. Big enough for any belt (short of a championship belt). Stable on small belts too though.
Really?
Yes, it should just fit.
100% cotton, made in India
It should. There are two loops in the back that a belt/strap of 3 inch width could fit through. The pouch (this is really not a backpack as it is only about 4" wide by 5" tall) will hold something about 5" tall, but if you want the flap to overlap and snap, the item can only be about 3/4 to an inch wide. If you don't mind it being flap-open, the flashlight should fit.
9". Very sturdy. I shortened mine by two links. Easy to do with needle nose pliers.
It seems to be solid copper. I wear it everyday the sheen wore off and now it is a dull copper color. Be sure to remove links to fit your wrist. I really like mine.
It does have a clasp, I keep my on all the time and have been wearing it for about 3 months. I got a smaller one for my wife, since the one she was wearing was not like these and the clasp broke. been happy with my.
Yes
Have had no problems .
HI, Most customers will remove a few links to make the bracelet the correct length. I hope that helps. Don
no
No magnets, just pure copper.
Here's a tricky answer, but it's both, depending on which way you measure. Straight across -- holding the ruler straight down my arm -- it's 3/8 ", but measuring the widest part, holding the ruler diagonally from outside edge to outside edge of the topside links, it's 1/2". It's the size and weight usually worn by men.
Yes, it's solid copper. It's the weight usually worn by men. It's long for a woman -- I used special cutters to remove three links. I got it to handle arthritis pain in that hand, and it works beautifully!
Yes it is, no plastic
Yes, it's a standard pin with a pin like a needle and a small clasp to hold it together. Perfect for a suit lapel:)
We bought one and it was metal.
Yes, they have an elastic band and can stretch to larger shoes. My shoe size is a 12 and they fit easily over my shoes.
Yes, I wear a woman's size 7 and they fit without that much excess. I bought these for my husband when he was wearing a surgical boot and they were much too small for that purpose.
No. And they run small.
From me? No size. I am a buyer like you. I have repeatedly bought size XL and they work for mens feet sized up to 14. Beyond that, they would not stretch. For shoe of lesser size and width, the size XL still "works" with the cover fitting more loosely as the size and width decreases. I personally wear a size 10-1/2 to 11 W shoe and these covers fit me just fine. Hope this helps.
I just wanted to protect my hardwood floors from wet/dirty footwear, I thought they were waterproof.
will not work mud would eventually seep through.
I am not sure. I had men, women and children wear them in my home and everyone had on different types of shoes and boots because it was a really bad rain day.
yes but they suck they split when wet
Wrapped in bundles of 25...
I thought they were only 1 size. I do know they will not fit a mans boot but will fit a mans size 12 sneaker.
I have not used them in airports, but I would think they would be considered like a sock. However, as you know, airport security personnel are pretty cautious on our behalf. Personally, I would chance it. Nothing ventured.... I travel with them for entry into temples.
No, this is a one size fits all
yes
We could order them. Generally one size fits all
I wear a size 12 tennis shoe and I can get them on. If your shoe size is smaller it would be easier.
One size. They fit my husband's size 12 shoes.
No these are not waterproof
Be sure to buy the large size, and they should fit.
I think it might be too small to fit over the aircast, especially if your husband has large feet. I wear a size 7 work boot and it fits over it very nicely with room to spare, but without knowing the size of the aircast boot I can't say for sure. The other issue is that the bootie will wear out quickly especially if a hard portion of the aircast rubs the bootie against the floor, which I think might be the case since you are trying to prevent damage to the floor. My best guess is that the bootie would not be a good choice. It wasn't designed for that purpose but does a great job of keeping dirt off the floor when you come inside, which was its intended purpose I think.
Perfect for running or cycling. I wear them all the time for that. No slippage and best part, minimal fogging due ti ventilation on top of lens, i highly recommend
They should as they are flexable
How small is your head? A dollar bill is 6". I placed a dollar over the top of the glasses after placing the glasses on the table. At no point are the glasses wider than 6". The back ends of the glasses are about 3 1/4- 3 1/2" so these glasses should not fall off your head unless you have REALLY small head....
It would be perfect for desert shooting or hunting, for sure.
they cut the glare really good--i had cataract surgery and i was told to wear sun glasses and i found these to be the best.
I did a search, and I don't think it is available. I suggest ask the company, No. 1-800-335-9347
No they aren't just for men. These sunglasses are considered right for a medium sized face, where as some of the other models are better for large/small. In my personal opinion, these are one of the most comfortable pairs, but all Flying Fisherman sunglasses seem to fit fairly well to most face sizes.
Nop
No
Yes they do...at least i think they do
I do! Yes! I absolutely soak my gold/platinum & diamond even my fancy colored diamond jewelry overnight. I have even forgotten about them & left in them in their for a week & they shine up like a brand new penny! Do not leave silver in it though, it causes the solution & the silver to change color & dull.
I've not tried to use it to clean silver, as I purchased Brilliant's Silver Cleaner to do mine. It worked really well for silver. This product does just as well for gemstones and gold jewelry.
Not too sure. I've used it at least 20 times and still cleans very well!
Clear
no you cannot use it on costume jewelry or pearls
I really dont know. I have only used it on gold. I use a different type of cleaner for silver. It is for silver only.
Yes, I have used several jewelry cleaners & Blitz Gem is definitely one of the better cleaners & very gentile for delicate chains, as well as pearls, etc. I was referred by someone about this product, and would recommend purchasing it. My jewelry definitely sparkles. I hope I answered your question.
I know you can use it on gold and diamonds because I use it all the time on my gold and diamonds so I am pretty sure you can use it on copper. This is the best cleaner I have used so far. It makes my diamond and gold rings sparkle and shine. A Walmart customer who bought this cleaner said this about the product: Blitz Gem & Jewellery Cleaner is ideal for Cleaning Gold Jewellery, Platinum ... household Metal Surfaces such as Stainless Steel, Chrome, Brass & Copper.
If I have a chance I will try to post a video. I gave it as a gift to my parents and will not see them till the holidays. I had very clear sound. It was a lot of fun last Xmas when I gave it to them. Our gathering did little sing alongs' with it.

I usually wear a 4E width, and I would say that the Vasque Wide is a little bit wider than the typical 4E width shoe.
Yes, it's extra wide for people like me with a duck shaped foot. Big and wide feet. These are fabulous. Only took 2 days to break them in properly and now I wear them for about 10 hrs a day at work. Never a foot ache. I'm getting another pair to keep because you never know when they will be available in this style and size again.
Bigger than I expected; but in long hikes, with swollen feet, that may become an advantage. In the meantime I wear them with thick socks.
I love the shoe.and i will say I wore then alot and they are still maintaining....they are a lil heavy but wearing them outside is all good.. they are better then timberlands.
I have a wide foot that is why I use men's sizes and perhaps the more important reason is that they last longer. That said I chose a D width because they run roomy, not over size. I can wear thin socks and heavy wool socks and adjust for the thickness with the boot laces which are part of the tung and tucks in very well to hold the foot back against the heel when using thin socks. Lastly I donot know if they make them in narrow. Amazon has a wonderful return program can't hurt trying plenty of room on the lace adjustment the wooly socks feel the best.
The Sundowner is more for everyday wear or short hikes. The Summit is a heavier boot made for more serious backpacking.
The soles are glued on. The top of the sole is not solid so there are few points of contact between the sole and shoe leather. I had the sole reglued on an older pair but it did not last.
Kiwi brand Cordovan color
Yes the inserts are removable. That was the first thing I did I purchased a pair of insoles from REI and they were cut to the exact size of the OEM and they work great.
you've got me here;;; yes, my first thought is that they were made in China, but I never knew about Italy. The pair I received were beautiful, but fit way to tight across the arch....this is happening to me from various brands, starting with Red Wing, and then Dunham (New Balance).
They tend to run big. About 1/2 size.
I use Kiwi brand in Cordovan. Should be available in stores, but certainly here on Amazon, too.
Sorry, but I'm in ny and my boots are not with me. I thought the size was in the tongue
B is considered an average or medium width ; CD is a wider width .
I will have to check as they are in my car. Just so you know, I love them. They are very supportive and comfortable. I appreciate your desire not to shop China. I am a super conscious consumer. They are awesome for supporting my problematic ankles and bunions. I guess u know all this. I will get back to u about where they are made. Have a great day. Aimelia
Its a d wide
I returned the Sundowners so I don't know the answer. The original, Italian ones had a Vibram sole which I liked .

I think those are girls sizes. Boys could certainly wear the boot, but you'd have to figure out the size equivalent.
The boot by Saxon seems true enough to size. I would purchase the adult size 7 ladies boot.
Using the US shoe size system, a girl's size 4 is the same as a woman's size 6.
At least a 3, and depending on the store, you should be able to exchange it easily if it is too small.
I would go up to a 12. this gives some room for growth. I always had my daughter wear thicker socks so the next size up gave space for her toes to wiggle
It should say "ladies" or "children"
I was as boggled by the size "chart" as you probably are. Thats why I went and bought Ariats from the tack shop this last time. My daughter preferred the Saxon Equileather and they did hold up better but the jumble of poorly defined sizes made me spend my money elsewhere. All I can say is to size up ATLEAST 1-1.5 sizes. Womens 5 would be kids 6.5 and I'm not sure a kids 8 even exists so better go with womens 6.5.
They run pretty true to size so go up at least 1 size or greater for the heavier socks and pulling on an off. The zipper ones run smaller than the pull on.
I'd go up 1 1/2 sizes. At least they ran that small when I bought them for my daughter. She actually preferred them to the Ariats that had to have the tip of the toe sole gorilla glued back after only 2 weeks of wear.
They are for smaller kids.

I'd go up 1 1/2 sizes. At least they ran that small when I bought them for my daughter. She actually preferred them to the Ariats that had to have the tip of the toe sole gorilla glued back after only 2 weeks of wear.
They are for smaller kids.
Black, grey, yellow. NOT all black.
It depends on the weight and height of your toddler. I purchased it for my 3 yo. At the time he was about 35lbs and it fit him snug. Not sure about his height, but it was just right. The muscles are foam not plastic.
I bought this for my godchild who was 4 at the time. The ost uke fit him just right, no chest constriction nor was it too tight in the neck. It was made very well and he loved it. He still wears it.
No. It will be too small. My son is 38inches/35lbs @ 3yra, and it was way too short.
I bought this for my then 4 year old godchild and it fit great, he loved it! I would say he was an average sized 4 yr. old.
Size depends on the height and weight of the child. Contacting the seller for information on size would probably help you.
Hello, We got him the TODDLER size, it is now getting a bit tight, but he's almost 3 now. He looks awesome in it, a lot of fun.
Size 4-6 in clothing size is preferable for an age 4 kid. My son is 4 years old alomst 5 weighs about 45lbs slim and usually wears 5/6 clothing to fit comfortably. So I think the small 4-6 would fit perfect in costome its totally a different material than regular clothing unless he's taller, then go with the next size. Hope this helps!
We ship the costume within 2 days. The time in transit depends on where you are located. We are on the east coast. It takes two to 5 days after the costume is shipped.
They make a watch press with different fittings with which you can press the back of the watch back into place. You need to make sure the press has a fitting that will accommodate your watch face without breaking the crystal if your crystal is curved or raised in any way. If your crystal is flat, any of the presses should work.
I have never seen a battery that would not just pop out.There is a small phillips but it is not the smallest I have seen.Would not buy this just to get the screwdriver.Buy a set of jewelers screwdrivers..
Yes it will, I too own a Kenneth Cole watch and I was able to open mine.
I've used it to open a men's sports watch. I hope that is sufficient information.
We do not use FEDEX.
Yes they work. I have found them very helpful. I have several different types of watches, and these tools made it so easy to remove the backs of the watches and replace the batteries.
You need to consider your childs weight as well. My daughter wore the size (M) 8-10 and it was a great fit. She was about 50 inches also but has a very slim frame.
Yes, I would go with the 18 month size, the suit is true to size and well made and I am sure that she will love it.
Hi Carol, I would get the 6-8. My son is 8 now and an average size. I bought this when he was six and I purchased the 6-8 and he has worn it a couple of years, Halloween, career day (he wants to be an astronaut), etc. It is the cutest and he gets so many compliments on it. He won't be able to wear it this year, he's finally out growing it.
I don't know. All children are different. How tall he/she is would be the determining factor. Good luck with you future astronaut.
I got the 6/8 suit for my son, who is in size 6/7 clothing at 4. It has room for him to wear it next year, unless another giant growth happens again. Everyone loved this suit, and we got tons of compliments on it
Yes
I think you should go for 8-10 size. The suit has straps at ankle and elastic at wrist place. So little bigger size will not be a problem. I ordered 10-12 size for my 8 year old and it's perfect for him.
My daughter was about 40 pounds at 5 years old, not sure about her height at the time but I got her the 4/6. it fit perfectly. Wasn't too long or too baggy. Go bigger if you're not sure.
My son is 150 cm and 45 pounds but fit is perfect
The size 6-8 is 14" from shoulder to belt; 21" inches to the crotch. My son is 4'3" and still (barely) fits in the costume.

I believe it won't fit your 1 year old ( too big) and I think it comes as on size. The back of the hat is not adjustable ( like regular caps)
It's black. Fits a bit big on my four year old but that makes it look cute
These hats are a standard size
It fits my 6-year-old with an average sized head.
Hi Milli, I bought if for a 1 year old with the Playskool Airport and it fit like a glove. He had a blast with it.
In the middle bought for 3 year old tall boy
During checkout, select 15 as the quantity.
And by"missing parts" you mean the horns? Hornless hats do not Viking hats make! And shows they're not intended for horny bastards! LOL
My head and hats measures 22.5" - 23" in diameter. And this helmet fits perfectly.
Yes. The horns were shipped detached. I should warn that other Viking helmet enthusiasts frown upon down-turned horns. It's a mark of shame or cowardice.
Cream to clean and blue to polish.
The instructions that come with it say not to and it will continue to clean even when worn. This is true. I have an old cloth that is much smaller, discolored, and has holes in it but it still works.
Hi, I used this cloth without any silver polish and the cloth provided an excellent cleaning job - my bracelets and rings looked amazing
Yes, this can be used on silverware. This cloth contains a chemical so be sure after you clean the silverware to wash it soap and water before you use it.
No you can not wash them.
I don't believe that a silver polishing cloth would work on jade, however they do sell a cloth and cleaner for precious stones and gems that should work very well. Good luck
yes
yes
yes
no
No, it rotates so that you can fill the cylinder one hole at a time.
We ship internationally & you can see the cost & shipping speed options when you complete your shopping cart. I would estimate for Standard Shipping it would be around $35.00 to $40.00 USD.
The plastic material is not flexible and it is as durable as plastic can be. As long as you don't drop it or bang it on anything sharp or hard surface, it should not break. Just handle it with care and all should be well. Store it at room temperature.
This gun is quite large. Almost feels like a replica of a 44 magnum.
it will fit grownup's finger, it's not a toy for small children
Dark gunmetal gray
orange like in the photo
I have not found one made for it. Most cowboy style toy guns/holsters are smaller.
3 feet
Yes. I. Think its perfect for 6 to 10 ish...not nearly as powerful as an airsoft but can still shoot it far enough.
Yes. It actually comes packaged, folded into a smaller accessory bag.
China
Possibly, but there is no padding on the straps, so it would be very uncomfortable for any period of time.
Yes, the shoulder strap is very sturdy, adjustable, and the carry handle is joined with a Velcro grip and is comfortable to carry. You can load this bag as heavy as you need......mine has met its match by being stuffed to the gills! Good bag for the money!
Yes there is one on both sides.
I'd say xlarge might not make it thru for carry ons, but good for checking baggage
I'm not sure about taking it on the plane. I checked it as didn't want to be bothered storing luggage. When full it is quite large. You will have to check the airlines guidelines about size.
No
I am not sure of the interior length, but there is no padding or anything inside that would make it seem smaller than the outside. The extra large is actually a very huge bag. I think you could use all three feet easily. I think it is more for outdoor items.
No. There is no padding on the strap.

No. But, it is well made, $30 less, and was perfect for my 5 year old grandson. Very cute. The straps were a little big for him but he didn't mind or notice.
Yes you can fit and ipad and wallet
We currently ship this item Internationally. Thank you
No, only a Dailey planner sized book.
Orders ship within 1-2 business days from the day the purchase was made. Thank you - Toynk
Yes, we do ship to Australia
I'm sorry it was given as a present so I don't have the details..can't Amazon help?
Most of the time I wash them on a delicate cycle and let them air dry. The socks don't pill as much if I turn them inside out.
Yes. Although these aren't a heavy weight sock, they are very warm for wearing in a cold house without slippers.
The description says crew length. On me that means it fully covers the ankle and goes up another 3-4 inches higher, as shown in the photo, and hits just under where the calf muscle is well-defined (hard to explain, but there's a little bulge if you are a walker/runner). Crew length also means that sometimes my skin shows if I'm wearing the type of slacks or jeans that hike up when I sit down (with longer slacks they are fine).
Some sizes and colors are Prime, and others are not. You have to pay attention to whether it still says "prime" after you've chosen your size and color.
Got them for my husband who is a 36 & the large fits him great! no shrinkage..just follow washing instructions..dry really quickly
They are not exactly transparent and they don't fit so tight like panty hose either but they are pretty thin. Thin or not they keep you very warm for such an almost weightless piece of garment. If you use them a lot they wear out pretty quick. I've bought several pairs of these in the last 10 years and hardly ever have to wear them but they do the job when you need'em
I guess you need to email the seller. I bought mine from a Terramar site that listed S, M, L, etc. Perhaps this seller simply listed the alternative to give you some idea what size S fits.
The pair I got will. I'm a 34 inseam and these are a couple of inches longer than they need to be.
I would suggest a small. My dad is a 34 waist and he likes a medium.
I don't know. My husband is a 36x30, got a large & his fit perfectly...try going by the size chart at the web site
medium
My husband is 6'3" as well. He wears a 36X34 pant size. I don't know if they come in various lengths, but I do know he loves the way they fit and feel.
I am 5'11" and average build - I'd suggest a medium or even a small. I have a 34" waist and the medium fits me fine.
Got my son the small and it was 5-6. I think the large is the 9-10
My child we bought the small for is 4. He is long, but tiny. The small costume works fine but we had to hem the legs because they were VERY long on him. The chest is a bit big, since it's hard, but it works. I think the small for your 5 year old would work well, just be prepared that you may need to take off some of the yellow above the boot.

How tall are you? Depends if you blouse them using blousing cords or tuck them in your boots with or without the velcro tape to hold them in place. If you tuck them in than yeah they should be fine cause they wont pop out of your boots even if you have that velcro blouse thing. I stopped doing that a long time ago. I would not recommend that for myself because the Long versions really are long. Stick with the Medium regulars.
Button
Well, as far as I know there shouldn't be any issues. Good luck!
Yes and yes.two front pockets,two rear,two cargo and two calf.remember to get the shorter length if you are using high leg boots so the calf pockets hang right!
Different manufacturers have different names for their products I find the easiest way to tell the difference is by just looking closely at the color. They all have that same digital design it's the colors that have Suttle differences. Hope that helps you! Aloha!
For me I got a Median reg and it said that they were poly/cotton when I ordered them, but when I got them there was a patch sown into the right rear pocket and is labeled as 50/50 nylon/cotton.
I'd suggest M/R (medium waist, regular length) if you like your ACU to be a bit loose -or- S/R if you want it tighter. But honestly you should get a tape measure and check your actual waist/inseam and pick from the very wide range of fit options and ACU /BDU has to offer. Good luck.
You should be good with a MR.
Just similar
The pants have a string tie so just go with the size u feel comfortable with and even if there a smidge big you can tighten them
Daniel, I have three Wenger watches and I have yet to replace the battery. I have to confess that I take my watches to my jeweler and just pay the price to have him put the correct battery and put it all back together for me. I have an extensive collection of watches and I prefer to let the pro's handle the details. Bob
I have used the watch for 8 months and so far the battery is fine.
Not sure what your spcific question from the single word "battery" . Have had the watch for sometime & functioning fine. I'd probably go to a jeweler who changes watch batteries for a replacement
No, they are made in INDONESIA. 519 are from VIETNAM. 623 are from INDONESIA. I will try to find a pair of 577, another review says they are made in USA and are comfortable. (The 623 is a comfortable enough shoe, though it isn't American made.)
Hello there! I do not remember what the tag said but I did go to their actual web site and found this: "In 2013, 1 out of every 4 pairs of shoes we sold in the USA was made or assembled here. Where the domestic value is at least 70%, we label our shoes "Made in the USA." I hope that helps :)
This have a very sold foot bed and provide plenty of support for me at 6ft, 225 lbs They are at least one width narrower than indicated
These shoes are perfectly designed. I have bought one pair, they just feels like comfortable. If I were you, I will buy it. But you need to pick the color which you like. The lump on the top of the shoes are labels of the NB. It is not a mess.
By US standards, a regular width shoe is called a "D". A 2 D then is wider than normal and an "E" size is wider still. I require a regular width so I purchased the "D" size and found the fit to be perfect. I was able to find the shoe that I wanted ( in my case it was 10.5) as a 10.5 D. If you purchase a D/E it may be a bit wider.
These are medium width, but are a half size larger that his normal shoe size and still fit kind of snug!
Hi Levan! To tell you the truth it's all in the cut. I say that because my son sometimes wears 10 in a half (those being a bit tight but wearing it he says they kind of mold to his feet), 11 (which is his size) and even 11 in a half in a pinch. We believe because they're made in different countries they're not consistent and also since while they're being cut on the presser cutter (at the factory) the ones on the top are smaller than ones on the bottom. So as you see is all a lucky straw! So far with the shoes we've got (3 of them in grey and 2 on black with white) are just right... I believe my self that you have to play a little as you do at the store when you're there to purchase them. Amazon has a lovely arrangement with PRIME service. (It cost I believe $75 for the same address for a year NO LIMITS!!) It's free shipping and free returns. We use it and it's very practical. Amazon authorizes the return label you make a copy of it and take to UPS service. NO questions asked. My son has being wearing them since he was 13 years old, now he's 33. (Where does the time go?) NO other sneakers for him at all, not even the stylish that they're so popular now!! He says that they're VERY COMFORTABLE! (Let me tell you that these shoes are becoming very popular again, not so long ago their price was very low and now has double and triple in some stores, on the web and real!! SUPLY AND DEMAND!! (This particular color and style of sneaker now are hard to find on either stores!!) I hope you'll get what you need and want. Enjoy yourself. have a wonderful life! Stay well! My best regards. (Tania)
The shoe itself will not help. If you buy one half size larger than normal and insert a supportive orthotic device I think it will. The shoe itself is rather lightweight and made of fabric which is somewhat stiffer than you expect in a running shoe. My expensive running shoes are "softer" and more flexible to the touch while providing great cushening and shock absorption. Personally, I feel running shoes are so critical, you should buy the best (ie: expensive) you can afford. But, that being said, these will probably work just fine with an insert.
made in Vietnam
Mine are made in Vietnam!
Only on two sides. This is a great shemagh. Comfortable. Warm in the winter, and cool in the summer. Love the color and the fabric, and it works well to keep out blowing dust.
Very olive green with black. I haven't had mine long enough to know if they will fade or shrink but at this point I'm quite happy with the quality.
100% Cotton
100%
It is woven.
It includes only the robe. You can buy the light sword on amazon. My grandson puts the robe on and goes everywhere......the robe seems to hold all the magic power for him. Best gift I have given him in several years. We did get a medium and he is a skinny 6 year old. Hope this helps
No
I bought this small for my four year old and had to alter it down to fit him. I would think it would fit a six year old well.
It depends on their size, but I think it could possibly work.
I would say Yes. My son is 5 and is a bit tall for his age. We purchased a Medium. It is a bit big. I think Rubies says that Medium is age 4-4.5' tall, so that would be correct. Note: I purchased this just recently and it WAS the whole costume. YMMV.
They run true to size so if there is a sizing chart use that. I can't remember for sure but I think I bought a small and it was fine.
I just went by the description and the boy I was buying for is only 6 so 5'2" seems far from his size. Whatever I purchased seemed to fit what it said it would fit. I would assume you would need an adult size for the height you want.

For me they fit right on. I wear an 8 in all shoes and have an 8 in other sloggers. They fit perfectly.
They are pretty durable. In my opinion, you could use a shovel in them.
I don't know if they are actually slip resistant but I wear them on a wet concrete sidewalk and in light, (up to 1/2 inch) snow to get the newspaper every morning. I am a senior citizen and feel quite safe in them.
The bottom of the shoes says made in the USA.
no...and I wasn't very happy with this shoe. very stiff. heavy and unbending. wouldn't buy again...just fyi.
I bought the regular but they seem roomy enough for wide.
I would go up
Not really sure, but I went with the 8 BM (US) and it was exactly a standard size 8 in womens, fit beautifully, no pinching what so ever.
I can only say that I wear an 8 (or 8-1/2 because if a longer second toe) and I get a women's size 9 in the Sloggers. I hope this helps.
I have it in white and no branding except inside collar.
If you are concerned about them un-tucking, don't be. The are generous in length. Awesome activewear for the bucks.
the colors present well in the pics, however I only bought one! I ended up going with gildan performance polyester shirts. considering the fabric used for these types of shirts, they will probably never fade!
Yes, the moisture control & wicking works with this brand. Augusta brand works just as well as the Nike brand & Augusta better priced. Shirt is lightweight & airy & dries up quickly.
Yes I wear mines as a workout shirt.
No
No
yes they fit snug if you have the right size. not sure if you will get the purpose out of these shirts being worn under uniform. not made for that to have the comfy cooling abilitys of the shirt. may be hotter.? id buy one and test it. i also ended up trying a couple of these shirts and went with the gildan performance. poly shirts. best work shirt ever! (with shirt only)
probably an adult small
I don't see why not. However, you better contact someone who prints shirts to see if you can print on polyester.

yes they fit snug if you have the right size. not sure if you will get the purpose out of these shirts being worn under uniform. not made for that to have the comfy cooling abilitys of the shirt. may be hotter.? id buy one and test it. i also ended up trying a couple of these shirts and went with the gildan performance. poly shirts. best work shirt ever! (with shirt only)
probably an adult small
I don't see why not. However, you better contact someone who prints shirts to see if you can print on polyester.
I have it in white and no branding except inside collar.
If you are concerned about them un-tucking, don't be. The are generous in length. Awesome activewear for the bucks.
the colors present well in the pics, however I only bought one! I ended up going with gildan performance polyester shirts. considering the fabric used for these types of shirts, they will probably never fade!
Yes, the moisture control & wicking works with this brand. Augusta brand works just as well as the Nike brand & Augusta better priced. Shirt is lightweight & airy & dries up quickly.
Yes I wear mines as a workout shirt.

I really don't see why not my daughter used it and she was small and it was a little large on her so I don't see why it wouldn't fit at 60lbs.
Two Double A's
yes! Its very cool and light to wear since its made with very thin material. Plus the fan doesn't let it heat up (if you live on a tropical island like me this would be an issue).
Yes, it sure will!
Yes....my son was 7 when he wore it. He's small but it was good.
I think so... it is very lightweight, and stays inflated with a fan that continuously runs and blows into the suit. Halloween is pretty cold in New England, and my daughter had to layer up quite a bit underneath to stay warm. Hope this helps!
My son was 6 last year, so I'd say 6-8. He weighs about 50#'s and it was big.
The back is open and the child steps into it and then you blow it up
Not sure exactly, but it's huge. My 7 year old will be wearing it and it looks like a gigantic ball!
5-10 seconds to inflate
It very well may be.. is a nice size and easy to organize with pockets and stuff. Best to you!
No
The bag doesn't have the type of handle that you would expect on a tote bag or something similar; it only comes with an adjustable shoulder strap. I suppose you could shorten the strap to make a "hand handle," but even at its shortest length I can still slip my entire arm through it. I hope this helps!
This picture is quite decieving, the bag is very small. Id guess it was about 16 inches long by about 5 inches tall and 2 or 3 inches deep. I was looking to fit a book and notebook along with my scope and cuff, but its way too small. Because of how short it is, books are out of the question, but if it's just for accessories, its decent.
It will not carry a thin laptop. You can place papers inside but they need to be folded hot dog style.
No, the tag says Made in China.
It only has the two straps that are on every backpack that go over the shoulders. There is not a strap that buckles around the bust for added support.
I have a 13" MacBook Pro with a hard plastic protective that boosts its dimensions and weight, and it still fits in the padded computer slot with enough room to spare for a 15" MacBook Pro, and even a 17" one. I honestly love this bag. I thought I had a good bag before I purchased this one, but I was wrong. After discovering the High Sierra brand, I must say that this is by far the best back pack I have ever owned! I pride myself in the time and research that I put in everything I buy, and I was not disappointed this time around. So, go ahead and get you one. - Sincerely, R.M.
It's not specially designed for one, but you can certainly put one in just like you could in most any backpack. And let the straw part come through a zipper opening.
I would not submerge this bag in water and expect it to keep your contents dry. However, I will say that I used this bag on a boat trip in the Bahamas last spring...where we had rough seas and rain. My bag was out in the elements and while it got wet, everything inside stayed dry. It is very durable, with nice deep compartments that will protect your goods. I hope this helps!
Worked great. I took it to California and no problems. It fits right under.
The strap is adjustable to be pretty long. Yes, you can adjust it to long enough to cover up the old bum.
w=4 1/2in h=13in L=19in or 20in including old cell phone style pouch
It is durable enough to withstand a decent amount of water. I grabbed a cub and poured some water on it a few months ago and it slid right off. Just be careful when bringing when its storming outside like crazy.
It sounds to me as though you're looking for the same thing I was when I bought this bag. I do property inspections so I carry camera, tape measure, small notebook, small light, etc and honestly I had high hopes for this bag and it failed miserably for my purposes. I'm sure it's a great school bag but it doesn't have the reinforcements necessary to hold it's shape or provide easy access. Don't get this bag for what you're doing. I bought a UTG Multi-functional Tactical bag and it's perfect. I also like the Bestek SLR DSLR Canvas bag for what you're doing both of these bags I got from Amazon. I carry either depending on my location. Good luck and I hope this helped.
it just has a shoulder and a handle
It is not long in height!but side ways it is long!but this messenger bag is not stiff!it is very flexible and it holds a great deal!from books to notebooks. and it has a lot of pockets.
I don't know...it's well made, but as I said in my review, it's huge. I'm a relatively large man and it's big for me to carry around. (I'd return it if I could). I would continue looking for something smaller. There's gotta be more choices for a child. Pay special attention to the dimensions.
Yes,it is big enough for 17.3 inch wide.It measures 19-20 flat.plenty of room to put more stuff.It is well padded too.
Blue, pink, and black.
Yes it will, its actually fairly wide and pretty long, it also expands at the bottom. It fits about three to four dictionary sized texts books.
I don't think it would all fit comfortably. My 10 year old daughters schools books and lunch pale don't fit so I would recommend something bigger. Also, the zipper broke within a month of buying it. Id spend your money on something better.
We used it to go to Disney and on a cruise in May. At times it was pretty stuffed with books/guides, cameras, etc. At other times it was overstuffed with beach towels. It held up fine! This past week I used it again to carry a bunch of equipment for a computerized ID system, again it was overstuffed with cords, supplies, a laptop, chargers, etc. The only thing I'd caution you about is that it has no padding (other than the shoulder straps), so if you're carrying anything fragile you'll want to be careful how you pack it.
I think it would hold everything except the clothing.
Yes, one on each side of backpack.
I'm pretty sure you can put a camel back inside but the back-pack was not made for that.
I imagine it would
The bottom is the same as the rest of the bag. Nylon. I wouldn't think it will hold up if dragged
The size is stated on Amazon - 19" x 13.5" x 8.5".
Might be a bit big, depending on the child's height. Could also be much too heavy if filled to capacity, again, depending on the kid. I'm a 5'3" adult and when I was 9-10 years old this would have been huge for me.
Yes it is a usable size. I have a 17'' HP Pavilion and it fits perfectly fine.
All I know it that it holds alot!!! I love it, lotsa pockets and comfy feel to it
I've had some pretty good rains to walk through so far, and nothing inside gets wet. The tech zipper has a cover over it for extra protection. I've been impressed with it thus far!
Not heavy at all
I think it is. My husband uses his for school and it has a section he keeps his laptop in, then other sections for his binders and work. It also has side pockets for water, and other little compartments for various things. He really likes it and says it was a good purchase.
Yes.
Did not have that problem, may want to contact the manufacturer
generally yes, of course depending on how full it is stuffed. the only place i;ve had some trouble is on aisle seats of some aircraft as there is less room under aisle seats for bags than center or window seats.
It can comfortably hold 750ml but I think 40oz might be pushing it a little. You can put it in another pocket like the larger one and it would probably work just as well.
No? I've never heard of it. I've used this backpack for 6 years and nothings happened
Used it for a lot of hockey stuff It fits all
11 pounds empty
No
You can take things in and out of the pouches, but in the main two compartments you would have to lay it flat
No it's too big.
No
No, it's pretty big and the bottom/back (where the handles are) is hard sided. It's been a wonderful bag! We've used them a ton and they've held up well, but they are kinda big and heavy.
It is only moderately compressible from top to bottom. It can't bed lengthwise. Used it last week for 10 days in Ireland. Great!
Maybe if you don't put a lot in it. Definitely check the airline specs and measure your bag. It's pretty big for a carry on and space is usually tight in the overhead bins.
I have not used this as a carry on. I have used it as my checked bag. Please do not try to use this bag as a carry on. It is far too large for the overhead bins. Your fellow flyers will not appreciate it and because of the sheer size I would assume you would be forced to check it anyway.

Best to detach watch band from watch (I didn't) ... lay band flat with arrows on back of band going away from the device that will be pushing the pin out. Be careful to line up the pin that is pushing to the hole in the watch band (try this only on links that have an arrow) .. turn handle to push pin out of the link (if lined up, comes out easily) ... My first pin came out easily, then I broke 4 pins trying to get the next pin out to remove the link, because I didn't have it lined up right. the pins will break if not lined up properly. After getting 2 pins out and removing the link, replace one pin to reconnect the links (push in and then tap in until it is in all the way and you are done. there seems to be another knob on the side that I'm not sure how to use or what the purpose is unless it is to finely adjust the position, so you can line up the pin to push it out. Be patient and be sure to line it up or you will break the pins, like I did. I was cautious with the last one (because I only had one left) and got the job done. If this instruction doesn't help enough, I would suggest searching on-line and you should be able to find a video showing exactly how to use the device to remove this type of watch link.
Yes you do end up with extra pins when you remove links. Pins that come with set are different . They are used to drive out pins in watch. Not all watches have the same diameter pin opening so you get 5 different sizes to accommodate most all applications.
1) Nuances in color scheme probably would be the utmost difference... And check the kit for extra pins (they break easily). 2) Yes, you could resise every braclet with this device, but be prepeared to do some fine alignement, if, for example, bracelet is tinner then the averege one for witch the device was designed. 'Coz it could by adjusted for ticker one, but not for very thin (and both ny watches as it happens fall into that category). Oh, and it alse couldn't work with bracelets wider than 23mm (0.9in.) or so. Anyway, with mine, I resised 2 watches without any problems (Seiko SNAE69, and Timex T2N499), but friend of mine, who I give it to just couldn't do it properly and spend loads of time, scratching bracelet in the process (and breaking 2 pins...). My point is: it is hard (not to mention naive), to expect from the piece that costs few baks to work well for everything and everyone;)
We ship from Tucson AZ
When I received my link remover there were no pins.
When you twist the screw, the area where you put the band of the watch will extend to the opposite side allowing you to put more of the band on it as opposed to letting it hang below. It makes it easier to adjust the length of the band.
If its links are like those you see in watches then it will work. I looked online how a willis judd bracelet look and based on what i saw il say this thing will work to remove the links.
Place bracelet in the slot. Line connecting pin up with the pin remover pin and screw the remover pin through the link pin. Note the arrow on the link for the correct direction to drive out the pin. I found that the device was way too light duty to work. Most jewelers will adjust the band for about $10, which I did, and it was worth it.
yes. and the pins are very weak
I applied it to a rope-like fiber binding around the edge of my leather chair and the result was excellent. However, if you are trying to apply it and have an even line where you stop, I think it will bleed and the line will be very jagged.
I googled Fiebings Leather Dye MSDS and found this; ethanol 69-75%, isopropanol 7-8%, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether 7-14%, and methanol 4-4% and pigment 4%.
I wanted a natural leather look so have not applied any finish. My shoes have boat or deck shoe flat look.
No
I did have the problem of Leather Dye wiping off and rubbing off onto my clothes from a handbag I dyed. I used Resolene as a top coat and it seems to have fixed the problem. Now I only use acrylic dyes for shoes and handbags.
The cap has the applicator attached to it.
In my case yes, I have two small dogs that send much too much time on our leather sofas. I should remove them but they run the house. For normal use I think you can do without.
It helpe my faded scratched leather purse look newer. Got compliments on my purse after using the product.
I used product as approved on label. It doesn't say you can use for clothing. I used on leather shoes and leather belt
not with this product, it doesn't last long.
I would say yes. I didn't use one initially and the dye had a sheen to it. However that polished out, although it comes back when I touch it up, and needs to be rubbed out again.
You would get a large. The little girl I got it for is 9yrs old, she wears a size 10. The dress was alittle big on her, but it will fit her good by halloween. If you get this dress, it is wrinkled pretty good, iron it on light setting and keep watching so it don't scorch or melt the material. It is very pretty.
We got this for my granddaughter when she was 10 (4 years ago) and we ordered a large; she was still using it this summer. So I'm thinking a medium should be fine. We were a bit disappointed when we got it. It was purchased out of season, so we weren't aware it was just a Halloween costume. The dress worked well for what it is. The cap was not very good; but we bought it for a Renaissance Faire, so we made a more authentic cap with material to match the dress. (get a sun visor and place is on the head like a head band with the top of the visor facing forward) She got a lot of compliments at the Faire and was even asked if she was part of the show...... :-)
Thank you for your interest. It does come in Medium with several vendors selling it. I cannot insert a 'link' here as amazon will block it. Try hovering over the size and it should bring up where one can order from. Also, you could try visiting our site directly.
Yes
The arch support does work well for me as I have a higher arch. It makes for a comfortable fit. I bet I have been wearing this style for over ten years!
I have not noticed this being an issue with mine. Have you lost weight? Changed sock thickness?
I am having the same problem
I found the whole shoe to be very soft and cushioned. Very comfortable shoe all around! Very thick and fluffy tongue on shoe and flexible leather parts.
I have worn these shoes for years and love them. I wear a 7 in regular shoes and a 7 1/2 in these. I wouldn't necessarily call them wide, but I wouldn't recommend them for a narrow foot.

No its just for back support you will need a postpartum belly band with velcro adjustments to push the stomach back in.
I'm not sure about the height being an issue but for me this dug into my hips horribly because it's all one width all the way around and not contoured around the hip area. I returned this after a day because it was so uncomfortable. Got an Upsie Belly at BBB and never looked back!
My daughter (who wears the cradle) prefers to use a pillow at night and let her skin breath.
Yes definitely wear it obvious under the belly pelvis area it's not hot at all sometimes I don't even feel pregnant when it's on. This one is the best one I own I have 2 of them. I'm 5'3 started at 113 lbs I purchased the petite and wear it now at 22 weeks in 2nd hook .
I use it for working out on the treadmill and elliptical, tho I stopped running in the 1st trimester
That is a question best answered by a doctor, but I do not believe so.
Yes, I am currently 6 months pregnant with my 2nd child and using the belt. I had a c-section with my 1st baby and the incision was done on the bikini line. I am not having any discomfort or tenderness on the scar area, and the belt line does press on that area. If you don't have any current tenderness or sensitivity in that area, you should be fine.
Im 5'7" and weighted 180 when I got bought mine it was a medium and I could wear it on the smallest setting and it fit well not tight at all plus its stretchy so it depends if you think you'd get a lot bigger
I wouldn't say it's super supportive. I gave up using it because it had to be tight to provide support and then I just constantly felt like I had to pee because it was tight.
Works well with my wife, carry a girl very low. Comfortable, except for sitting long term... But when sitting, she does not require it.

Yes it fits studs and long earrings.
I bought this a long time ago and gave it away almost as soon as I got it. As far as I remember, with the studs on you can, but not with any other kind of earrings.
One was already broken when I unboxed mine, so I have to say not very.
nothing yet..... but just use a feather duster
Yes this is much better I have two of these and my earrings don't tarnish.
If you use the post holes, you will have 1 1/2"-1 3/4" inches depending which row of holes you use. If you need to hang them, you will have 2 inches.
Not really - it does fold, but if it's full of earrings the folds just enable it to stand up on a flat surface. It's hard plastic/acrylic, and reasonably heavy - well-made.
I think you could... BUT you would to mount it in a way to take it on/off the wall (meaning you might have some longer nails to hang the holder on, but need to be able to take it down to fasten earrings to the holder/remove earrings from the holder - the holes are not that large as to screw it to the wall). As you can see in the photo, there are ridges on the top row that would make it easier to wall mount. I can't speak to the durability of the acrylic in using the holder this way, but it would probably hold up for a while.
Yes, but you may lose the space below them. Works very well with hook type back.
no I don't think it would.
1.5 inches
Yes, the black liners are included and removeable.
No it cannot.
Hello Leon, Yes, we have these in stock and for sale on Amazon. To find the item use this Amazon link http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I84QZO or ASIN # B000I84QZO The price is $89.99 Thank you, US Acrylic,LLC
Hi, Unfortunately, we do not ship any orders to other country. We only provide shipping in United States. Please accept our apology. Lara| BuyDBest Inc.
I went with the information on a review as follows: Small - 6.5 - 7 Medium 7.5 - 8 Large 8.5 - 9 Xlarge 9.5 - 10 The numbers refer to the circumference of your hand (in inches) measured around your knuckles. The sizes for these gloves run a little small when compared to other manufacturers who generally consider 8 and below as "small".
These will definitely add a lot of warmth to any thin work glove. But if you're gloves use Velcro clasps, you may want to think twice. Silk gets caught up in Velcro extremely easily, and can start to look frayed after a while.
I wear them inside of my regular gloves as my hands are always cold. Last winter was bitter here, and shoveling snow always left my hands numb, these do help.
I have used them with a touchscreen phone, but that isn't their intended use, and so it's kind of hit-or-miss. I wouldn't buy them expecting to use them for a touchscreen, when there are other gloves designed for that purpose that work very well, every time.
Great liners, and they work amazingly for their thinness. I just used these for winter camping up in the North Woods of Wisconsin. During four days in the great outdoors, using these in conjunction with non-insulated windproof gloves, my hands stayed warm and toasty. Even after my gloves got wringing wet, my hands stayed warm. Wrung out the gloves, put them back on, felt the cold dampness for a minute ,than the liner started doing its job, trapping body heat and keeping moisture away from my skin. Wearing the same gloves without the liners, while stringing Christmas lights for 4 hours, my hands used to get cold, but not anymore. These things really work.
For me, they work great on keyboards. Of course, you have to pull them on all the way so that there's no slack at the fingertips. I wouldn't expect anyone to have trouble pulling them on all the way even if the fingers are long, but if that's an issue cotton gloves might work better because they're stretchy. Also, the gloves are slippery, but that's OK. At first I had trouble because of reduced tactile sensation, but I very quickly got past that.
"Sandeep, I also have these gloves and they are great for all my needs. Keep fingers warm in the coldest weather and I compete with them in shoot competitions which require fast firing, reloading and fire in all conditions, never failed me once. Since they are very thin and stretch comfortably they will probably serve your need very well, however I have not used them for that purpose,yet. Hope this helps, good luck
I don't know about that. When you wear the glove liners, it makes your gloves warmer. If you get too hot, you can take off the outer pair. Might be worth a try , and don't cost much.
I would purchase the medium. They are pretty thin and stretchy.
Yes, no problem with using ipad/iphone when wearing the glove liners. It is really thin, like silk.
I believe it does loosen stones and jewels that are glued on. I had a pearl fall off one of my rings that I dipped and cleaned. I do not leave anything in the cleaner for more than 5 seconds either because I'm afraid. Wear gloves and rinse well!
I have a bracelet that is silver with my name in 14 gold, and I have used used this cleaner numerous times and it does an excellent job. No damage.
This solution should not damage the metal. However, some artificial stones do not tolerate silver cleaning solutions very well. I would suggest that you take the cap from a water bottle or juice bottle, and place a bit of this solution in it. You can then put the tip of the post in the solution, without placing the entire earring in it. Once you are done, just quickly rinse with water, and pat dry. No matter what you use this for, it only needs a few seconds to clean jewelry. Don't walk away. If you leave metal too long in the solution, it with start to strip the shine or sheen from the metal. You don't need more that 45 seconds; usually less than that to fully polish your jewelry, and make it look sparkling new. This is a great product. If you are still concerned about damaging your posts, you can put toothpaste on a paper towel, and rub the posts. It does pretty well at removing most tarnish. Hope this helps.
Hi, how are you? I actually put a piece of jewelry in the cup, put the lid back on, wait 5 seconds, then gently shake it 5 times. The five time shake also takes five seconds. I then lift my jewelry out, and give it a rinse and pat dry. This 10 second rest and shake rule works faster than just sitting the jewelry in the container and waiting. It has never failed me, and my jewelry comes out sparkly each and every time No matter how tarnished a piece is, I have never needed more than 20 seconds. Going past one minute will start to take the sheen off your jewelry, and you don't want to do that to your sterling. Hope this helps Laura. :-)
I've used this product to clean all types of silver jewelry but mostly Pandora. It does a wonderful job.
I'd recommend Hagerty's Jewel Clean for sapphires instead. I rarely use this product but use the Jewel Clean every week for my rings.
It's safe for jewelry.....I use it on a cloth, but, then I do wash the jewelry. The product does have an unpleasant order. As for silverware, you might consider contacting the manufacturer.
Have never tried it on stainless steel, but it is great on silver and GOLD!!
I am not sure but I have used it on a silver ring with a red stone and it did not damage it. I also used a toothbrush to clean the ring instead of dipping it in the container. I hope that helps.
I wouldn't soak the whole charm, just wipe it with a cloth - around the enamel part. Better safe than sorry!
My daughter has the youth size of the daisy print hat and it has the long strap, not the chin strap as shown in the picture. I am guessing that the picture shows the chin strap because that is for the younger kids.
1 hat
Yes it has a strap that goes under the chin which is adjustable.
Yes they have men's also. It should be made the same as the toddler. It is a great hat for wearing in the pool and outdoors. Maintains it shape with all activity, washing and packing. Future plans to buy more.
Sunday afternoon's play hat is great. provided excellent protection from the Sun and fit well. You can also adjust the hat with the pull string. Don't know anything about iplays.
Mine does crease, but I was able to shape it. I don't have it with me right now it's packed in a box but I am pretty sure the front bim is the only part that is shaped, so if you fold it front to back, in staff of side to side you don't have to crease the bill.
no! It is water repellant.
light weight nylon with built-in sun protection.
Not in the infant model that I got.
There is a size chart on Sunday Afternoons website. You need to measure your 11month old and determine which size you require.
Measure around your head just above your eyebrows - size small = 20-21", size medium = 21-13", size large = 23-25"
I have washed mine. I air dry it though and am careful with the brim. Gentle wash.
No, it doesn't.
From bottom of band to tip of brim is 3 7/8". Have no idea which is longer
The brim at the sides are too wide, it would be uncomfortable.
depending on the size I would says it's unisex
Yes. I bought myself the large sand colored one and bought a medium purple for my mother. We really enjoy them.
I've worn my hat while swimming. I didn't put my head/hat under the water but it did get wet but it dried off pretty quickly.
Yes, it has a small patch of Velcro on the back so you can lift up neck flap.
Yes I would think that you can I pull mine up with a clip
It is a really tight fit to begin with, or at least it is for me. I am the type of nerd that had the helmet handy and a chainmail coif along with it to check --- So after trying it on, I say it is possible to wear, but your nose is all sorts of smushed and I can see it getting uncomfortable near instantly (again it was a tight fit and a bit uncomfortable to begin with, so it is a tad bit moreso). Also it scratches the paint pretty good on the inside of the helmet. But in the end, I could easily see the argument that getting your nose a little bent out of shape is a small price to pay to look completely bad ass. Hope that helps and best of luck! tl;dr : Meh... It can fit, barely, but might be uncomfortable.
I have the same hat size and this helmet fit my head. I bought this helmet for a production of "Spamalot". The rivets on the vertical brass contrast piece would press against the wearer's nose, but that was an easy fix with some taped in padding.
I don't know what gauge steel this is, but it is indeed heavy. It's not a lightweight aluminum or the type of flimsy construction you might find in a costume shop. This is good solid steel, though I would not bet my life on it SAVING my life in battle. I got mine for historical re-enacting rather than fighting, and it is extremely convincing for my purposes. I imagine the helmet would take a moderate broadsword blow without denting, but I would not want to be inside it at that moment.
I can't give you the actual measurement but I am sure ypu will be happy. Bought it for my oldest son and he has a very large head. At least an XL size. It fits him with room to spare.
It is large and heavy. It has no padding on the inside. It's more for displaying than anything else. I wouldn't recommend this for a 10 yr old. Hope that helps.
It's at least a 7 3/4 hat size if that helps. There's plenty of room for padding on the inside and it has survived being dropped onstage every night without damage.
RUN AWAY FROM THEM; DO NOT BUY
I bought my son a Large and he wears a 36" waist in jeans. These are meant to fit snug, so do remember that when ordering. Hope this helps.
these shorts are just good enough to be used as underwear. Very confortable and the dryfit material keeps moisture away =)

It comes with a cup included, and I believe it's one size fits all since, as far as I know, it doesn't let you select a size...
My son is 30 waist and the men's small is good a little snug. I'd say a medium at least.
This would be excellent for baseball. Sizing is the same as with any athletic supporter(i.e. jock)
I looked everywhere and couldn't find "just shorts" . I just got this and now have 2 cups

I'm sure these are standard screws. Try you local big box stores. Good luck.
Yes, it is 20 inches to the top of the cushion and 17 3/4 inches of bench below the cushion. The cushion is nicely padded and does not compress much. I think you may be at almost 19 inches, but hopefully this bench will work for you as it is a beautiful piece that is well built. I use it daily at my dressing table and have had it for about two years. If it does not work out Amazon is great about returns.
I'm sorry that I can't help you. The bench didn't quite fit the area for which it was bought -- vanity area (it was too high.) So, I returned it.
It's VERY sturdy. I weigh 250 lbs. and use it everyday. It could hold much, much more.
The product description answers this question....it has two rows of ring pads and an open center section (where you can also store rings).
There are 10 on each side
This item weighs 80 lbs.
We don't know of the other item. This item is by Powell with model number 582-314. Perhaps you can compare with that information. Thank you for your inquiry. Beyond Stores. 888-349-6096
It is deep and I would call it gold not yellow. I feel it can match up with any color furniture . After 2 years I love this piece just as much!
The second drawer is divided into 9 sections about 5 inches square, so no little dividers. I ordered some plastic dividers and used them in the lower drawers. This has lots of storage space to work with.
Yes, one on each side of the unit.
Yes
The top does open, but there's no small "secret" drawer directly under the top.
Not sure of the content or type of wood used. However, it is a relatively sturdy piece of furniture, and I have been extremely happy with this. One word of caution: if you ever need to move this item, make sure to secure the side doors closed so that they don't accidentally come open during moving.
No lock
There are two rows on each side. I am a VERY picky person and I can say that I love this jewelry armoire. I have a jewelry business - so I have a lot of jewelry. The only recommendation I would make is that you purchase the divider trays for the drawers - only the first two drawers come with built in divider trays.
There is no lock.
It is lined but I do not know if the cloth is 'anti-tarnish'.
Yes it is
No. We received only the main unit itself---which is a great piece.
Yes it does and is well padded. There are two ring areas all the way down both sides of the top area and the middle is for anything else you would like to store, watches, bracelets, etc.
The top flips up and there is a storage space.
Its wood products, however its not a solid wood. Its painted except for the top and base. It does seem sturdy enough though. I've enjoyed it.
Drawers 3 -7 are 10 3/4 " wide x 9 1/2 " long Drawer 3 & 4 approx 3 " deep Drawers 5, 6 & 7 approx 4 3/4 " deep
Yes, 582-314AT2
The kids vests run pretty large so I think the large would probably fit you. I ordered the small for my grandson who wears a 10-12 and it was pretty big for him.
Small would be perfect for a 7 year old.
Boys size 10 would be a medium. Medium is a 10/12. Large would be a 14/16. And this vest is really "way cool", to quote our young Indiana Jones..;~) It is cut on a slightly larger scale which allows for unrestricted movement in our young adventurer. I'd do this again in a heartbeat..! I'm really happy with this purchase..! Kevin..;~)
small
I purchased it and am 5" an dafter putting in camera equipment it its tight
My best guess would be "small"
There are 3 inside pockets. (Remember though, the vest runs very big)
Depends on the size of the 3 year old I suppose. I bought it for a sturdy 6 year old and got a medium which is good for him, if a little on the large side. But it gives him some room to grow.

I had my initials engraved, I'm sure they can engrave anything
after i ordered it the emailed me and asked what i wanted on it and told me how many letters and rows i had to use. they e-mailed me 3 times or so untill i got it right they worked with me and was very nice about it.
Engrave with Thomas Robert Scanlon
Yes, I did but I simply with my initials. You probably can check with them if you could specify more details like font choice, size, etc.
I bought my regular size and it worked just fine. They are a pretty snug fit (so you'd better be realistic about what size you really are) but I would think that's what you want for the base layer
Long sleeve, just like the picture
hi shauna. i didn't have a clue as to correct 'sizing.' but i'm tall and thin....(5'7" 115 lbs) and love the mens small). the fibers feel great...nothing like clothes made of 'oil!'
Hi Margaret: Absolutely washable. I'm going to get myself a pair also because I'm so impressed with these. You will not be disappointed. Pam
I would assume they do shrink but I always wash them in cold water and Woolite and have had no problems. I am amazed just how warm these underwear were.
Not sure of weight but it's light. I bought mine for an ultra race to stick in my bag. Not sure how warm it is but it passes for mandatory kit in ultra marathons.

Nothing heavy for sure. No pouches etc. I am not in the military, but I believe the velcro patches on the upper arm sleeves were meant for insigia, rank, ( the military identification ) corps, battalion etc. The ACU I have has ( small ) pockets under the velcro patch. I hope this helps and that you are as happy as I am with your purchase. Cheers, Boris.

It is suppose to be but not sure.
No does not have ir on them
There is no bug repellant applied to this jacket. There is a water repellant applied to the fabric during manufacturer that will wash out after several washings if not reapplied.
That does sound about right, HOWEVER, I would go onto Propper's website and review their size chart. I referred to Propper's fitment guide, and it was spot on!
yes
It is authentic. Yes.
It meets the regulations.

When I zoom in, this mask looks to have a nose opening just like the one I ordered of a different color and pattern.
Yes I keeps your ears warm it's great, but there is a problem of fogging up your glass. I do wear glasses and it happens a lot when your outside in the cold. I have been thinking of making two holes at the noses allow my breath to escape.
Yes
I don't talk a lot with mine on, but I haven't had any trouble with moisture getting trapped inside.
No
It does have a slight smell, but it doesn't bother me. Of course, I use it for motorcycle riding in cold weather, so I have plenty of wind keeping the air fresh.
No, it is very light weight.
Velcro close on the back! It fits verry comfortable and can be put on over glasses without removing them.
Yup perfectly

I measured the loop - 2 1/8 inches.
No, they do not. They do have a 3-4 inches of elastic material on each hip to allow for concealed carry with an IWB. That feature is great.
You would have to know your waist size and length size. They do not come in small/short like Propper's regular BDU's
They seem to be what they are advertised to be. They are well made and worth every penny I paid for them!!!
They are fitted in the leg. i do not think you could get knee pads under the pant leg.
8 pockets. No zippers except fly. All velcro
These run a little big and have a good amount of give, but to be safe...I would.
I am a 34 and because of what I carry I ordered a 35 and I think that you should allow a little give room because no ones waist stays the same for as long as these pants will last.
I have a pair. They are poly-cotton, but they feel like and have the weight of canvas.
Yes they do come with a belt
Hi, I'm 5'8" and slim and they fit my hands nicely, I think my hands are normal for a woman my height.
one pair per order
It's more of a universal size. I'm a woman and I ordered large gloves and they fit perfectly. I have longer fingers so I tend to wear men's gloves in large
Didn't try that. Preferred them out, but sure you are right on proper way to wear them.
I'm not sure what gauntlets are in this instance, but I can tell you they come above the wrist. Hope that helps.
my wife got the medium size gloves, she usually wears a small size for elastic gloves, so you can probably go with large.
I would definately get a smaller size. There isn't any spandex at all so you would need a snug fit for a fun ring.
No just a good white cloth glove that I was able to use as gloves to play Willy Wonka.
It is a thin material, so careful washing by hand would work. I will have to buy another pair next year. Depends on your usage.....
No, they were not too /super tight. I have rather long,slim fingers (now with an arthritic bump or two) and they were just right for me. Excellent buy in very good quality gloves. The material is soft and just stretchy enough to be comfortable. Hope this helps!
Western vests have fancy stitching and/or carvings and sometimes tassles with metal studs. Motorcycle vest are usually plain looking and black, with very few pockets, with dark colored rivets. They also usually have no lapels.
Basically there is a 2 size difference between Asian sizes and USA sizes. So, the vest I ordered at 3XL is really a USA XL. To get the size I actually wanted, which was 1 size bigger than I normally wear, I should have ordered a 5XL so I would have gotten a 3XL.
I don't know the size, but I do know that this item will have to be taken to the dry cleaners to eliminate the very strong odor from the leather.
It should. The vest run smaller in size but is a very well made vest. A friend of mine wears a large and I got him a 2xl in the vest and it just fix. Hope this helps.
Yes it does have 1 inside pocket on left side.
china
Hello, Can you please give me 24 horas, I will do my best to get them and I will be back to you. Thank you
Should be on total order. Chestnut Gifts
yes. PW Gifts has four
Yes
I bought it a while ago but if I remember correctly, it came in a box with the picture of the item on it. But you can always wrap it yourself or throw it in a small decorative shopping bag with a little tissue paper. I like it very much because at night I throw my rings on it and my earrings and some pendants (if not very large). They fit on the dish part on the bottom. It's also very good if a woman removes her rings before washing dishes and puts them on this so they don't get lost. My friend lost one in her sink.
Yes, it did come in a box
I think it is considered medium. rk
i think it just means medium. while [w is wide ww is more wide] i have wide foot so the men's shoe is wider and worked for me.
Shoes are advertised as unisex at Bowling Ball .Com. You can find a conversion chart for men to womens sizes on internet. Hope this helps
Don't use the size chart on amazon. It is a universal size chart. Google or whatever "BDU size chart" this will tell you what you need to know. I have warn BDU/ACU style pants for years of all different brands. The BDU sizing is the closest thing an exact science you will find on the Internet.
I always had the choice. You may want to check another seller or go with 5.11 or Blackhawk products, ther're better and have the wide belt loops that can handle a duty belt where the Propper's are really small( also made in China, I prefer American made). -Good Luck
Large.
I would say an XXL Reg. That should give you the length you need. The waist should support your size.
I don't know what the Marines are accepting as serviceable trousers. I was a Marine before the digital camo, and then we were able to get by with several brands of cammies. These seem very durable , but I'm not sure if they would pass inspection if they are of a different style. These are made in China , so I bet the Corps doesn't order these particular trousers. Sorry I'm not much help .
I may not be of any assistance but I'm a 96cm (38") waist and 167cm (5ft, 5inch) height and I take a 'Medium Short'. Even then the bottom seam of the trouser leg touched the ground (and with a bit to spare) in my stocking feet.
Buttons
Not sure they are sized large but might be able to have them adjusted to fit you
No.
I got the multicam and that is a legitimate print. I can't speak for the marpat but I would venture to say it's good.
No it does not. I am very happy with it! Ron
Yes...the zipper on your lip is not the issue as much as it just not staying in place when fully zipped. The material itself has been no issue for me while in the field; I work in film production, the biggest compliant is no fastening clip or button to hold it in place when fully zipped. hope this helps.
Sorry, man I just use it for cycling. However, I can tell you it does a okay on the bike. It's been a while since I used it. I use to ride; so, I can tell you most likely some air will get through...hey, but it cheap. Hope, this helped.
Buy one without a zipper. Depends on head size but they all stretch. Make sure you can pull it over ur mouth during really cold temps. IMHO
Hello: We are in California usually 2-3 business day in US.
Not really. You would have to unzip, but then it will not be tight enough to do that, it will slide down. It is not really a stretchy fabric. It's fleece-y, so not rigid, but not really stretchy.
Don't use the size chart on amazon. It is a universal size chart. Google or whatever "BDU size chart" this will tell you what you need to know. I have warn BDU/ACU style pants for years of all different brands. The BDU sizing is the closest thing an exact science you will find on the Internet.
I always had the choice. You may want to check another seller or go with 5.11 or Blackhawk products, ther're better and have the wide belt loops that can handle a duty belt where the Propper's are really small( also made in China, I prefer American made). -Good Luck
Large.
I would say an XXL Reg. That should give you the length you need. The waist should support your size.
I don't know what the Marines are accepting as serviceable trousers. I was a Marine before the digital camo, and then we were able to get by with several brands of cammies. These seem very durable , but I'm not sure if they would pass inspection if they are of a different style. These are made in China , so I bet the Corps doesn't order these particular trousers. Sorry I'm not much help .
I may not be of any assistance but I'm a 96cm (38") waist and 167cm (5ft, 5inch) height and I take a 'Medium Short'. Even then the bottom seam of the trouser leg touched the ground (and with a bit to spare) in my stocking feet.
Buttons
Not sure they are sized large but might be able to have them adjusted to fit you
No.
I got the multicam and that is a legitimate print. I can't speak for the marpat but I would venture to say it's good.
Measures 17" x 10-1/4" x 9".
It is black and it is fabulous... looks a lot more expensive than it is.
Yes, all compartments are lined, even the smaller pockets.
I don't see why not. It is pretty sturdy and durable.
17"Lx10 1/2" W x10"H
From a loop to a loop straps is 20 inches, the belt crossing a body of 40 inches. (it is machine translation)
It has a strap over the top in addition to the carrying handles.
Yes, it's quite small and you shouldn't have any issues fitting it under an airplane seat.
Oh yes, it would be plenty big for a gym bag and still have lots of room for other things.
No compartments on the inside. Each 4 sides of the outside has compartments.
Yes it does according to the tag that came on the bag.
Yes pretty easily depending on how many and how thick your books are. Now I will say if your books are of average size, you shouldn't have a problem at all.
I would say yes it would fit. Now that truly depends on how much you are putting in it of course but I do not see it being a problem.
I did not use it for that but my son used it for school books for the past year so I imagine it would hold up. Near the end of the year the telescoping handle became a bit temperamental but still worked. Large back pocket will certainly hold quite a bit.
10 inches across the zipper. 9 inches top to bottom and opens up to 4-5 inches on the inside. It's a very generous pocket.
My daughter never wore it as a backpack ... it was too large for that for her. (She's in 6th grade.) At her school they only have half-size lockers and she doesn't even use it there anymore, it just doesn't fit in the locker.
I don't have the exact measurement but I can tell you it does hold a ton of books. My grand kids go to catholic school and they are required to lug a large amount of books each day. The book bag held up all that weight perfectly throughout the year and it still looks great.
No this bag does not have side pockets.
I don't know the official dimensions but it is a full-sized adult backpack. Add on the wheel base, handle and plastic support structure it's a pretty hefty backpack.
It's pretty large and roomy inside. It depends on what you call a good-sized lunch bag. My son puts his lunch, notebooks and books inside along with his jacket and umbrella.
Boots are about 12 inches in height. They are pretty heavy and somewhat difficult to get on. They have zippers in both sides of the laces but if you wear thick socks, they can be difficult to zip. They are kind of ackward to walk in because they are stiff, but I think this is more of a benifit then a hindrance
Hi. I am not sure what about the boot looks different to you or maybe I am not able to see the same picture you are looking at. Checking here though http://www.milwaukeemotorcycleclothing.com/boots/womens/riding-boots.html?p=3. And through their page there is no hit for loggers or logging style troopers. I am wondering if it's a wrong photo or maybe an older style of the boot. I'm sorry for not being much help but the photo I see looks like my boots.. which are the same as shown on the website link I put here. The boots I got were on the large side of the size marked and I could have easily went a half size smaller. The boots were comfortable and not too hard to breaj in. Nice and sturdy but still comfy and soft. Good support. Good luck with your shopping.
No, its only about a 1/2" to a 1" inch heel. The whole boot though, will give you an 1" to your height with the heel giving you an additional 1/2" lift. Very similar to military or combat boots. They are very comfortable, extremely true to size, are naturally a wide toe boots, and keep the feet very warm. I wear them riding my motorcycle and in the deep snow of winter without any issues.
Yes
sorry. no idea. I returned mine pretty quickly. they were true motorcycle boots, not just fashion statements. tough, rigid, and completely inflexible. very uncomfortable. it would probably take years to properly break them in.
i dont think so. I retuned them terrible fit and very heavy boots
3/4"
I don't know but I love my boots, but you need to wear thick socks with them. I tilted it over on my bike these boots saved my foot from being crushed. and they save the body of the bike being scratched up. The bike ended up with a black scuff mark that wiped away.
C is a slightly wider width in a shoe. Most shoes are a B width.
Yes, these are pretty close in size. I did go up a half size though because a slightly loose fit adds a bit of space for your foot to keep warm as cold air hits your boot. This is just the way I choose to go with riding boots in general, and not due to the fit of the boot. This is my favorite boot. It saved my ankle and foot in an accident. I will always buy these in the future.
I got a large and it was more like an XL.
I normally take a large and I ordered a medium as somebody said they run large. Glad I did, the medium is just right for me.
There are two zipper carriages a top one and a bottom one. The top one is the one you use to zip up, the bottom one allows you to vent the vest from bottom up. Possibly you've got the zipper carriages locked together, if so wiggle them apart, move the bottom one down then the top one. If this is not the problem I'd say you've got a defective zipper.
I ordered Men's small for me (I'm 5'4" wear a size 6-8) and it's big on me, so I would say the medium should be just fine. I think the large would be overwhelming. My son bought the large, he's 5'10" and 230 and it still has a lot of room. My husband is 6' and 180 and I bought him the medium and it's a perfect fit. (These are unisex) They run on the larger side and yes they have a zipper pocket on the back, along with pockets on the interior also. I hope this helps you!! (We decided to put off the trip to Africa for a trip to Croatia instead, so It will be awhile until we actually get to use these!) The best backpacks for travel (I was a travel agent 22 years and flight attendant) and I love to bring all of my worldly possessions with me are: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Mens-Black-Military-Canvas-Shoulders-Travel-Hiking-Laptop-Student-Bag-Rucksack-/121255603379?pt=US_CSA_MWA_Backpacks&hash=item1c3b65acb3. These have gone on us to several trips and hold everything.
Hi Mary, here is the Amazon link. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SRLCEI We have them in stock in large.
No
I have no idea what product you are referring to so therefore I can not answer your question
Yes it unzips in the front but it seems to be running a bit on the large side
They run large.
Sizes run differently depending on vendor/manufacturer.

yes on the 'inside' of the glasses, has it on every piece: written "E Z87+"
Yes, and they are polarized and anzi certified safety glasses
There pretty dark. Up close you can see eyes but from 2-3 feet away you can't
Yes they are, but they still won't make it "dark-as-night" and that's actually a good thing.
They don't scratch any easier than other glasses. I've worn mine for 3 years and they've held up well
dont know but best glasses for dual purpose
No they do not. They are pretty close to the face
no it's on sale right now. Sales ends today!
Yes
there are no additional shipping cost. Hawaii is considered domestic shipping
I am pretty sure it is made in china because thats where all of mattels toys are made and fisher price is under mattlel. maybe we should just have our kids wear gloves when they play with toys and take them off and wash their hand after their done or better yet maybe lead proof suits. jk
i can not find this anywhere but on amazon.com...does anyone know what stores may carry this item? its not even avalible on the fisher price web site...what going on with this?
I bought a set of three pouches. Only the smallest, car key size, had a lanyard. Incidentally, it is the only one of the set which has lasted more than 12 months' intermittent use.
yes. This is 12 X16 so it can hold upto regular iPad or tablet size 10 x 13. make sure all air are squeezed out prior to locking up for better contact.
Yes. I put my iPad 2 in it without a problem.
yes
Ingrid I do not know. It will fit a 7" Kindle fire w/o the rubber skin case perfectly, if that helps.
Its clear only on one side

No, It has a little square pad inside that absorbs and holds the oils. I've never had it rub off any pewter on me at all.
No, you do not have to lift the pendant to your nose. I have even had a co-worker smell it when I have walked into her office and others just mention the fragrance at times. It is a great way to get the continuous aroma that you want! I don't think you would be sorry in getting it. I liked mine so much I ordered more for gifts.
yes
I bought this as a gift for a friend and she would just use a torn off piece of a cotton ball to change to whichever scent she wanted (I had also bought her a sampler set of essential oils) ;-)
I don't know exactly I gave this as a gift. However, my Mom can slip it over her head and it's not really short on her.

24"--but be warned, it turned my neck green.
I would say that it is approx the diameter of a quarter. I do not have it in front of me at the moment though to be exact.
I have seen many items made out of coins in general, like a necklace, ring, beltbuckle, and even watches. I do not see why you could not have this coin put into a ring. Being that it is the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy's death (december 1963) I expect a lot of people will be buying this 1964 Kennedy coin because of the anniversary itself. You might want to also get a 2014 Kennedy half dollar 50th anniversary coin when it comes out, and have it made into a matching jewelry item - that would be sweet!
No.
Yes, very nice coin.
No. It just comes in a plastic baggie.
Yes - they are listed within the detailed page describing the Kennedy Halfs. It's about 20 cents more than the PHhilly Mint issues. Thanks for asking, Steve
The 1964 Kennedy half dollar was the only 90% silver business strike to enter circulation.
the s&H set by amazon
Yes it's everything all together.
They hold the charms in place which is very nice because then you aren't having to constantly adjust them in the jars. Hope this helps!
I'll go measure one, but I can tell you the lids don't stay on very well. I actually have 2 for sale right now, let me know if you are interested. Cathsciteach @ aol.com. They are 1X8x15
No, this tray doesn't have a lid. However, the tray is the standard size for stackable jewelry trays. If you have other trays you cn stack them for easy transport.
I think it would do ok if mounted on the wall.
This is for the tray with the 50 insert.
They just sit on top not really snapped but I have had very little trouble with them coming open during travel
I ordered my same size, and they fit perfect! These are sooo comfy-I am on my feet all day in a huge greenhouse-so I am very picky about foot wear.
I feel they run true to size. I ordered an 8 as I read other reviews that said they run small, but I disagree with them. I hope this helps. They are very comfortable flip flops.
Yes, I bought them for my wife and she loves them.

There's a strap with Velcro at the end that wraps around bottom of shoe to "cover," but the fabric seemed too small to cover shoe competely. My experience is the strap was useless & just came undone during our walk around the neighborhood. Best tip is to just have child wear black shoes.
No -they are sold separate.

We don't ship to Peru.
No
No, you must buy it as separate items.
It is nicer than a mask it has four straps that connects together in the back
It's a very heavy mask with a very thin very long piece of fabric with a piece of Velcro on the end. It cannot support the weight of the mask and the childs head would have to be bigger than a basketball for it to fit.
I think it might be too long. Otherwise I think it would work
It depends on your height. My daughter is 5'5 and 130 lbs. It is long on her and also is heavy vinyl. I don't know how well ventilated it is...she wears it in Taiwan in the rain but not to work in.
Not really - it's very heavy & pretty stifling even in the winter!
Hi Carme, This is small.
Mine says small, but it fits me really well, only the sleeves are a little bit small but I love it, is really good for me, if it would have a zipper would be perfect
Hi linda, It comes only in small.
I would think a small.
Yes, they are little fake boots that slip on over shoes. Great costume, my daughter loved it.
Yes, I think the medium would be better.
I'm sorry but we do not ship internationally.
Idk but the pink costume ran a little bigger then expected but was still a great buy
Yes, it does have an inside liner.......worth the price....I actually purchased 2, one for gym bag and one for travel..
One pocket on the outside, NONE on inside........smell? none so far.......it is darn classy looking, not as large as I anticipated but perfect for 2 to 3 day trips...actually, more of an overnight bag......again, classy looking.......worth buying? I think so but also I own 3 bags, 2 are larger for electric shaver, electric hair shaver, brushes/combs...Steve Sawyer
I'd guess 12"x6"x6" - be prepared to through it in the washing maching, mine smelled like mildew; but it's fine now.
Go up the next size
I bought a size 10 and they have plenty of room in them. If size 9 were available at the time and had I known they run big, I would've dropped down to a 9.
I believe they should be. My son used them when out basement flooded w no problem. And he uses them to scrub and hose out the garage.
Hi Sorry no Thank you for your communication texasvalue
They are true to size for me...I wear size 10 shoes and the size 10 of these boots fit me.
USA!
I have men's. Don't know about size comparisons, but you might like to know these boots feel very heavy.
I think they are sturdy enough to just step into them. I'm 71 years old, have arthritis and am not that steady on my feet but I step into them. :-)
I looked at the other answers because I really wasn't clear on the question. Even though some of the answers indicated no lining, the interior material of the boot is not the same as the exterior. I would definitely say it's the underside of the boot, meaning, the material is different. (But that may qualify as "no lining." I just don't know.)
Yes. One pair comes with purchase. Best 13 dollars you can spend on boots.
INSTEAD of shoes.
Whatever women's size 12.5 correlate to in men's size is what you want because the size is actual. A size 10 is a size 10.
true to size
definitely unisex, a simple boot but runs big. I would take a 1/2 off. maybe order men's size minus women's differential?
Yes each +.
NO! I ordered them twice and only received one hat in each order! And because they are not from Amazon but a third party I had to go through the hassle of sending the one hat back twice.
Yes. it comes with an elastic chin strap.
No it was a single hat when I made the purchase in October.
Sizes run true.
Not been an issue for me
Not at all, it's very soft. I won't buy itchy wool, or itchy anything. And it's washable!
They run large. I normally wear a medium, heard they ran large so I bought a small, which was PERFECT for me (5'10", 150lb male).
nature cream, XXXL has price tag 24.99
I'm 5' 10" 165 pounds and a medium fit perfect
I frequently ran in mine, wearing it over a long sleeve shirt, and I was comfortable down to about 35 degrees. Don't forget gloves and a hat, however!
Mine have not. And I've had them for over a year and wear them quite often. Follow the instructions and you well be fine.
Each person is different and their tolerance to climate is going to be different. I tend to overheat easily and found that 45-65 with this product is great. It keeps me cool in the warmer weather and warm in the colder weather. However 65 might be the extreme of this weight. I would suggest a light weight merino wool base layer if you are going to be in 60+ degree weather. You can always strip down a layer but it is hard to strip off your base layer :)
Not this model, sorry, I thought the question was if I could answer
My husband usually wears it alone so I'm not sure about over a shirt. I think you might need to go up a size as the ones he has are a snug fit.
I'm 6'2 175 lbs and normally wear a large. Large fit fine. Sleeves are long enough and it fits taught but not tight.
I use my base layer for cycling only and it gets washed after each use. I can't comment on extended use without washing it.
Don't know yet. I haven't washed it.

approx 13 inches
This set was two light and dark cloth together. One set in each box. 2 boxes.
Yes you can, it polishes up great!
Good morning. Yes, and it comes with two polishing cloths. Have a wonderful cloth!
The clothes are not cleanable and should be replaced after they load up with tarnish. I have used them for many years on gold/silver and they work great.
It was a little tricky for me as well. You must push the zipper portion underneath the locking mechanism(when the lock is open) and then press the locking mechanism down, which will capture the zipper and lock the assembly.
Good question. Never had that problem, but the zipper on mine got stripped a couple of months ago so I'm getting a new one just like the old one. Great little bag though, no complaints on mine, got a lot of good use out of it.
Yes they do, and they are Great quality in both the Bag, Lock and the keys
Sure, but it could probably be opened with a dull set of play doe scissors.
Mine came with a different set of keys for each that were not interchangeable.
Yes I eft my key home & was at work & I opened it that way
No, it will not lock without the key.
Just got this how do u close & lock it
I have pink, red, black and aqua. My favorite is probably the red, but all the colors are rich and true. I store my earrings in these boxes BY COLOR as much as possible. Love the ability to organize by color!
That's never happened to me, yet, so I am sorry that I can not provide an answer for you.
No, the compartments are not removable.
The compartments are 1 1/2 inch squares.

I got my mom a set for Christmas. They were just as pictured. Hope this helps.
I bought these a while back but I would guess about 3/4" of an inch long

Each hawk faces left on each ear and readily seen.
Where would we be shipping them?
YES
My wife is 215. and she fits into this nicely. your daughter should be fine
I'm going to say yes. I am about 108 lbs. This robe will wrap from one side all the way to the other side and vice versa. This robe is superb quality. You will not be disappointed. The applique is very rich, very soft and cozy. I have not seen one like it anywhere. Betty Boop collector for years!
It's one size fits all. I bought it for my best friend and she is a plus size 18W and it fit her good. Not much room after that tho. And it's actually pretty nice. :)
I bought my son a Large and he wears a 36" waist in jeans. These are meant to fit snug, so do remember that when ordering. Hope this helps.
these shorts are just good enough to be used as underwear. Very confortable and the dryfit material keeps moisture away =)
Hello Parker , Thank you for your email. I have provided some sizing for the Shock Doctor Undergarments below . It shows the garment , waist size in inches and Protector size : Boy's Small 20" - 23" Youth Boy's Medium 24" - 27" Youth Boy's Large 27" - 29" Teen Boy's X-Large 30" - 32" Teen Men's Small 27" - 29" Adult Men's Medium 30" - 32" Adult Men's Large 33" - 35" Adult Men's X-Large 36" - 39" Adult Men's XX-Large 40" - 44" Adult Thank you Parker , Pure Hockey Customer Service 1-978-838-2700
It comes with a cup included, and I believe it's one size fits all since, as far as I know, it doesn't let you select a size...
My son is 30 waist and the men's small is good a little snug. I'd say a medium at least.
This would be excellent for baseball. Sizing is the same as with any athletic supporter(i.e. jock)
I looked everywhere and couldn't find "just shorts" . I just got this and now have 2 cups
Below is a sizing chart to help you decide which size would work best. Size Waist Small 26" - 30" Medium 30" - 34" Large 34" - 38" X-Large 40" - 42" XX-Large 42" - 48"
No hip padding, just for cup support
Cup is white semi-opaque
It didn't require extra batteries. In fact, the batteries that came with it are still going strong, almost 9 months later.
Yes, it is durable. Also, it depends on how he plays with the toy.
I believe it is
Yes
We've dropped our countless times. Still works.
No.. I dont think it's made with porcelin.. looked fiber , rubber/wooden finish
The tip lights up, with a fairly bright light beneath an opaque cap. But the whole wand does not glow, no.
No, it doesn't.
The one I received requires a key to unlock and unscrew the bottom. We lost the key, and made a new key by grinding the end of an old Ikea hex wrench.
Yes
Yes It looks real There is a small " key" that you use to open the battery compartment . My children have enjoyed the wand
At the non glowing end there is a little slot. I take the key that came with wand and twist the end off.
It's a durable plastic. My daughter loved it.
It's hard plastic!
when you flick it or move it, the tip lights up!
It was a gift
It is plastic so it does not look like a real wooden wand. But my 8-9 year old loves it and all the friends that come over like to play with it as well. We do have none toy wooden wands but this one is great for play. Love the case it comes in. We have the cover on display. Hope this helps.
Yes I can not remember if it was included or if it a common battery found around the house. We purchased it for a birthday over 2 years ago and said battery still works
It has one on the left side of the shirt.
cotton/poly mix. very sturdy. My son wore his all the time until he outgrew it, and it never showed any sign of wear.
I am 6 feet tall and about 170 pounds and I got a large so I'd go small and remember they are meant to be a little loose but all the tightening straps will fix that and if it's still to big then I'd dry it just a little
Yes, actually I ordered a medium and it fits a bit larger than expected and I'm 5ft. 7in.
I think the large should be fine. Its always easier to roll up/cut off material than to try and make something fit that's too small.
No, it os tiger claw
I'm 5' 10'' and wear mediums, these were large size
James, Yes sir at this time we are. We are expecting a new shipment to arrive around the end of April 2014. Steve
Unfortunately I do not know. I ordered the Extra large and it fit me well. I am about 6' or 6'1" and I weight between 165lbs to 175lbs. I hope this helps.
Honestly, I don't use the ties. You cross the left portion over the right portion of your jacket and tuck them into the pants.
Darn close these are very comfortable.
10-18 according to Amazon. It does not say on the socks:)
Yes, I do believe that you could share, being only one size apart. As to the size you choose, this may help you. I am a lady who wears size 11 narrow shoes. I purchased the medium in these socks and they fit perfectly.
Made of nylon, no wool.
I bought a medium. I wear a size 8 shoe. The socks fit fine.
As another answered: look at size chart, it shows a range of sizes that fall into small, medium or large for both men and women. Find your SHOE size on that chart within the correct gender, and you will find what size you should buy in the socks. So: I am a female, size 7 shoe...corresponds to a size small sock. Hope this helps! They are great socks, both my husband (size 13 shoe so a Large) have these and really like them. Good luck!
Millimeters of mercury,(mm is millimeters and HG is the chemical symbol for mercury) it's a unit of measure of pressure
Yes......I wore them on my trip from Seattle to Amsterdam and Italy roundtrip.....very comfortable and walked all over the plane in them without shoes.....I tell everyone who travels overseas to buy them.
Hi the sizing chart use to be right on the product page but i am not seeing it anymore. I wear a size 9.5 shoe and the sock size is a medium. I would contact the seller Vitalsox ( click on the link above ship and sold by Amazon) they will answer the question or google Vitalsox and website second link down
I would think so, but can't say for sure from personal experience.

I really don't remember. I returned it, but it was small.
I bought it as a gift so I don't recall. But I can say the little boy I gave it to wont take it off. His Dad is a united pilot. When I saw it I remember saying it was made very very very well.
Yes! It fits really well.

Here's the size chart from Fox River's own website: http://www.foxsox.com/CustomerSupport/CareProducts.aspx
I find that it does a better job than others I have bought.
Yes, and it also has a lot of support.
These socks would probably not dry quickly after washed by hand because they are thick socks, but I don't know about the travel socks. Your best bet would be the fox river socks similar to these, just not the triathlon socks.
I wear a 10 and fit perfectly into a medium, so I'd suggest Large, not X Large.
The XL sock fits my size 13 foot.

Best to check the Wigwam site, but I don't think polypropylene is used. I've used these socks for 20 years of running and triathlon races of all distances including ultramarathon and Ironman distance. They are simply the best. No stink and no blisters.
This is a pretty thin sock. You may want something a little warmer. Is it for running or cycling that you need the socks?
As a 15 year user of these excellent socks, just follow the sizing guidance form the website. I love em. Never blister either.
Hi Steve C. Long story short... I wear 10 1/2 EE Mizuno Wave Alchemy and 11 EE Asics GT 2100 series, as well as Gel Nimbus... but when I buy these particular Wigwam socks, I buy the extra large size, because I have foot problems and tight socks just don't work for me. Pinched nerves and bad circulation are not fun. The extra large size fits me perfectly after the first washing... and are only slightly loose before that first laundry trip. Good luck
These socks are for men, not women. I ordered them for my hubby, who wears a size 11 shoe.
I'd say 3+.
No issues, Mine had to be adjusted a bit but once formed works fine.
No I believe they are too big for this track.
no way to small do not recommend under 2
No, they are made in INDONESIA. 519 are from VIETNAM. 623 are from INDONESIA. I will try to find a pair of 577, another review says they are made in USA and are comfortable. (The 623 is a comfortable enough shoe, though it isn't American made.)
Hello there! I do not remember what the tag said but I did go to their actual web site and found this: "In 2013, 1 out of every 4 pairs of shoes we sold in the USA was made or assembled here. Where the domestic value is at least 70%, we label our shoes "Made in the USA." I hope that helps :)
This have a very sold foot bed and provide plenty of support for me at 6ft, 225 lbs They are at least one width narrower than indicated
These shoes are perfectly designed. I have bought one pair, they just feels like comfortable. If I were you, I will buy it. But you need to pick the color which you like. The lump on the top of the shoes are labels of the NB. It is not a mess.
By US standards, a regular width shoe is called a "D". A 2 D then is wider than normal and an "E" size is wider still. I require a regular width so I purchased the "D" size and found the fit to be perfect. I was able to find the shoe that I wanted ( in my case it was 10.5) as a 10.5 D. If you purchase a D/E it may be a bit wider.
These are medium width, but are a half size larger that his normal shoe size and still fit kind of snug!
Hi Levan! To tell you the truth it's all in the cut. I say that because my son sometimes wears 10 in a half (those being a bit tight but wearing it he says they kind of mold to his feet), 11 (which is his size) and even 11 in a half in a pinch. We believe because they're made in different countries they're not consistent and also since while they're being cut on the presser cutter (at the factory) the ones on the top are smaller than ones on the bottom. So as you see is all a lucky straw! So far with the shoes we've got (3 of them in grey and 2 on black with white) are just right... I believe my self that you have to play a little as you do at the store when you're there to purchase them. Amazon has a lovely arrangement with PRIME service. (It cost I believe $75 for the same address for a year NO LIMITS!!) It's free shipping and free returns. We use it and it's very practical. Amazon authorizes the return label you make a copy of it and take to UPS service. NO questions asked. My son has being wearing them since he was 13 years old, now he's 33. (Where does the time go?) NO other sneakers for him at all, not even the stylish that they're so popular now!! He says that they're VERY COMFORTABLE! (Let me tell you that these shoes are becoming very popular again, not so long ago their price was very low and now has double and triple in some stores, on the web and real!! SUPLY AND DEMAND!! (This particular color and style of sneaker now are hard to find on either stores!!) I hope you'll get what you need and want. Enjoy yourself. have a wonderful life! Stay well! My best regards. (Tania)
The shoe itself will not help. If you buy one half size larger than normal and insert a supportive orthotic device I think it will. The shoe itself is rather lightweight and made of fabric which is somewhat stiffer than you expect in a running shoe. My expensive running shoes are "softer" and more flexible to the touch while providing great cushening and shock absorption. Personally, I feel running shoes are so critical, you should buy the best (ie: expensive) you can afford. But, that being said, these will probably work just fine with an insert.
made in Vietnam
Mine are made in Vietnam!

Hi Hun These are not designed as a replacement for a bra. I use them strictly to enhance my shape. They are about 3/4 inch at the thickest point. You could try an adhesive to hold them in place but I am not sure that would work because they are pretty heavy. I hope I have answered your question and congratulations on your upcoming wedding. XOXO Kelli
If you are using as an enhancement they would work. If you are using as a replacement for a breast these are more like a B cup. My left breast was removed due to cancer and I am a D cup. I must wear both of these stacked into my bra cup to fill it out.
These are concave :/
These would work great. They are small but natural looking. The only thing you have to keep in mind is that they don't work well with all bras.
I would recommend two pair in that instance, and you may want to use some form of adhesive, as they have none, and have flown out of my bra. But, these are very real looking and feeling. Be also aware that the have rather prominent nipples, if that is an issue. I love them.
It's definitely not as big as a DD. But I've been using them after my blobs disappeared after 2 babies, so I would think so.
I wouldn't really be able to help. I received mine but didn't really like them- just my opinion but they were pretty heavy and didn't work as well as I had hoped they would (in my opinion). Because of the product, they cannot accept returns (which isn't stated on the page), so be really sure that you want it or are willing to eat the cost in the event that you don't like it. I tucked mine away in the event that I might really need them for something but to be honest, other than first trying when received in the mail, I haven't used them. Good luck!
It depends on how big you already are. I'm large and wide (6'2", over 280lbs.) and have much larger natural breasts than a small skinny girl. On me, they're a very slight, almost imperceptible change, but allow me to wear a cup size larger (it's very difficult to find bras with a large enough band size but small enough cup size for me). On a smaller girl, I imagine the change would be very noticeable.
yes that is what holds them together
As you might know cancer prosthetics are very expensive ,so i got these for my bathing suit only ,looks great feels great and work just like the real thing in water !love them ! you can get a suit with bra lining in it and slit it from the arm side just a little put them in and guarantee no problem !try it !
I think it would be cool
Not sure... The band I got fit perfectly with my Core.
No
I found the design to be different than the one that came with my Suunto Core wrist computer. I found the difference to be an improvement as it let my wrist breath more and sweat less. Can't tell you if the wrist band will replace a D9 dive computer thought.
Yes
Yes. It is lighter than the original - as per its name. My replacement didn't last as long as the original so I went back.
There is another choice if you use the core replacement strap with the buckles at the ends. Usualy they are orange and black. This strap will work and look better but has to have the pins at the end. You will need these to attach to your watch.
I'm not sure. I have two straps other than the original for my Suunto, but I don't know if the D4 accepts all straps. I'd give Suunto a call.
hello, please let me know if this used whit the suunto t3.
Yes it is an original Suunto band however you will need additional band tabs to mount for they are not included.

The hat itself is 100% cotton, the molle band is polyester
I hadn't noticed until you brought it up, and I measured it - there is a slope, exactly those dimensions. Perhaps the designer was going for a rakish look, but I simply put my boonie hat on just any old whichaway.
I wear a 7 5/8" hat and i have the 3/4" and its obviously loose, but its comfortable. If you like your hat to fit tight enough to not need the drawstring, go with the 1/4". However, if youd like a more relaxed look/ fit, then go with the 1/2".
No
The light doesn't come through but you can see the fabric brighten up. I wore this all day for a canoe trip and I had no sunburn on my scalp. I have thining hair.
sounds like a large or xl..but i am not completely sure of that...
Yes, it has the chinstrap.
Approx. 2 1/2-3"
Sorry, I did not run it through a water test. But, it appears that it would keep your head dry for a light rain scenario. However, I have not worn this in the elements yet
I would just get a good pair of felt lined waterproof boots and wool socks. These socks are good for keeping your feet dry but they also make your feet sweat a bit. In a cold weather situation these socks would keep your feet dry, but they would also be frozen.
it was a pair of 2 socks.
I wear a size 8 tennis shoe and bought a medium. It is slightly loose, so I would say a medium.
Not too thick. Very comfortable. Nice in colder weather. No regrets for me.
Yep. I got these for running, so the interior socks were soaked in sweat. So even though my feet did not get wet from the snow, they were wet from sweat and just as cold because the air and ground was cold. If you are not working out too hard, interior socks might add warmth. These socks are not warm like wool, just water proof. :)
These socks are tough to rate for activities like that. It will certainly keep your feet dry in terms of outside snow, but your feet will end up very wet due to sweat, as they do not breath at all. Think of it like wearing a wetsuit on your foot.
In a word, Yes. For winter use always get full calf length - not mid calf.
I am using them for a long time and I feel it. I haven't tried them under water.
My husband says no his feet still sweat in them
Their not warm, but WILL keep you feet dry as a bone
I bought a xxl and usually worry about shrinkage, I've washed and dryed the sweater many times and it has not shrunk one bit. Hope this helps
slow
I believe so, but not completely because it has not shrunk. I have washed the one i bought for my child several times, always in cold, but i dry in dryer and as i said it has not shrunk. And if you wash inside out it stays soft too.
It is my grand child's so I have asked their mother to measure for you. Will try and find out.
One would have to know your definition of tall, but in general I would say no to the small for tall and skinny as it would be too short.
Not sure, sorry we bought it as a gift for our granddaughter, we went with the medium just to make sure it would fit her. I think the medium would work, if it doesn't fit you can always return it!
I would think so based on the info provided. Thing is, there is no exact fit when it comes to BDU's, especially the jacket. It kind of hangs loose with plenty of room for movement and stuffed pockets. Remember, this was designed for combat. Hope this helps.
Delwyn - I am 6-3, 200 pounds and the XL regular is just right for me. I have long arms and the sleeve length is always a bigger issue for me than the length of the body and while I wouldn't want it any shorter the regular is good.
Yes it is ripstop
My son is 6ft 140lbs and I got the medium regular. Google BDU size chart for more specifics.
I was not sure what that meant either, so I Googled "BDU sizing chart". It gave me info for all of the BDU sizing and I ordered the Medium Regular. It fits my son very well. It comes down to about hip level on him. I hope this helps.
I don't know. Do what I did, I went to Propper's website. There is a size chart there. That is how I found my size.
There are a variety of sizes. I am sure that one would I am 5"11' and 270 I got XXL wide. I bet XS tall would fit him but you should google search for "propper BDU size chart to get the exact size that will fit.
Age doesn't matter. Does said 14 year old wear mens size clothing? If yes, then it will fit if you get the right size.
It's a shirt and is poly/cotton.
It's a BDU coat. It is designed to be worn in warm weather and in cool or cold weather to be worn over other layers of clothing. It is not insulated. It's like a shirt made from heavy material.
I got the toddler size for my daughter when she was two it worked fine.
The dress I ordered was for my 5 year old granddaughter and it was quite ling on her. She is about 46" tall and usually wears a 6 x or 7. Thid will fit for several years but it was " cutesy" big but not sloppy big.
velcro
The toddler size that I purchase fits my 3 year old granddaughter. I would say it is a size 3 or 4 costume.
I bought this last year when my daughter wore a 2/3T & it fit very well. She still fit into it a couple weeks ago for a party & she's a 4T now.
I'd go with the next size up. I wear heavy socks in winter and my size 10's just (no wiggle room) fit. If you plan on wearing heavy socks, upsizing is my choice.
I think that would be a good idea. Just whatever you do, get something with better traction than this style!
no
My husband and I are just about the same size shoe. I ordered his shoe size and these boots fit us both. So I would order 11 W.
Maybe for summer, but not spring and fall. We're in Finland, so we wear them year round (doubt it gets much above 85F here in the summer). We wear them with our shorts in the summer.
It is metal. Very sturdy. For the price I expected a lesser quality product, but we were pleasantly surprised. It came in a clear plastic circle container. It fit my 4yr old nicely, but it is made for an adult. It is beautiful and I am so happy I got it.
It measures 1 1/2-1 5/8" tall according to the picture I got from my daughter. I had purchased it for my little princess granddaughter. It is very well made with metal and crystals. She loves it. I hope this helps.
It's a decent size tiara that sits on the middle of the head. I wore it for my wedding and it was perfect. It does have combs. I loved it. Hope this helps.
I bought it for my friend for her bachelorette party so I don't have the exact height measurement I believe it's at least 1 1/2 inches or a little bigger for the tallest part. I was happy with the size it wasn't too small and not too big just right.
It probably depends on how big she is. It can be slightly bent to make smaller or larger. It fit my 8 year old with no problems.
One lock comes in each pack.
The lock cable fits easily through the zippers on my luggage. The zippers on most luggage seem to be large enough to accept a lock like this.
Yes
I find the cables to be much easier than the rigid locks because you don't have to jiggle the whole lock around to find that magic angle that will allow it to pass through the things you are trying to lock. All in all the cable adds a few more degrees of usefulness to the traditional rigid lock style.
Look for the dots
I hope you're asking as the potentially robbed, and not as the potential thief! However, my theory is to lock every single thing I leave in the room, and at least I can frustrate the impulsive thief, the one that can't resist an opportunity. I think there are more of those than the plan-ahead thief who breaks in with the plan to steal something specific. Of course, light items like backpacks and briefcases can just be carried out. I'll usually lock my backpack and then leave it inside my suitcase which is also locked. Some hotels have large enough safes to stash a small laptop or spare cash. I must say - there is so much security these days that I'm not sure it's worth it to worry. Be prepared, and usually you'll be happy with the results. And bolt cutters can thwart any lock, zipper, or clasp.
They have a special key that opens it. I used this extensively while traveling in Europe this summer, and it worked perfectly.

From your description, it sounds like you may have the incorrect code. Be sure the correct code is set with digits above the white dot. Try reverse the order, instead of 123, try 321. Also try digits that are left/right of the digit you selected. For example, your code was 123, try 023, 223, 113, 133, 122, 124, 013, and 012, so on.
3"
Its about 12 to 13 inches long and about half an inch wide at its base.
Resin I believe.
It is a quite sturdy resin. My son plays with his all the time. I think, if you sat on it, you might be able to break it, but it is NOT flimsy.
Thank you for your interest in our products. Both of these are available to order from us via Amazon, but rush shipping is 2-4 Business days. If you order today, arriving early next week. Unfortunately we do not offer overnight shipping.
No. They're fixed.
They are all the same size and about 2inch by1.
They could, depending on how small the items actually are. Beads the size of a pencil eraser do fine, they don't jump dividers. I would imagine smaller items could possibly shift around.
Absolutely perfect. You can organize each color into separate compartments. Good thinking! This product is made very well, and fits into my drawers nicely. Personally, I use mine for jewelry, but looked up Loom bands and thought it would be perfect for those too. Go for it, I don't think you'll be sorry.
I am not sure what you mean by stacks. It is one layer deep divided into 20 compartments.
Yes, the lid is tight fitting. Everything stays in its place. It's a great organizer.
Its actually a flat bottom container. I agree though, I find it hard to get beads from this thing. Especially if you plan on using tiny beads.
Enough to put between one to four pairs of earrings. Varies, depending if they are wire or clip ons. Also, thin bracelets, like a tennis bracelet, lapel pins, tac pins, etc. I purchased three of them and was very happy.
No.. I think this is way too heavy/bulky for that.
Hi. I do not use it for bangles. The tray on the bottom is Pretty small and would not hold a large bangle bracelet. However, you could hang them from some of the hook and they would be just fine. I don't think it would be the best but definitely doable. Hope that helps
14.5"
Kara, the color is black. Hope that helps. Shirley
Yes it does and it comes with two keys
It's a regular mirror. Not frosted.
My wife feels the slots are more than addiquate
hmm i don't think it would make sense to do that. the piece comes assembled (it comes ready to mount on your wall) so you would have to remove the door and lock and figure it out. But the inside is uniform so theoretically the hinge could be fastened to the other side if you were so inclined
I would advise against it. It does come with anchors, but it generally should have a load-bearing beam supporting at least part of the weight. Plus, if it is on a door, you will scratch the glass if you're not careful. This is really a pure wall-mount type of item.
Only if it is a solid wood door. It would be to heavy for am ordinary interior hollow-core door

In my case doesn't go that way. I use it to exercise at gym and is very comfortable
I have a 44 inch waist and ordered a XL and it's a little snug. It's loosened up a bit from washing. If I had it to do over I probably would've gone with the XXL.
would like 3"wide waste band, is it available
You get 2 for the price
No, they do not. This is one of my favorite jocks. The only thing to check is the waist size to make sure that fits.
Sizing is just like every other pair of american underwear :)
Probably large... I'm a 40-42 myself and went with XL and it fits well.
Small
Perhaps measure your waist or check your pant size, Joseph? The different brands of jeans and khakis I wear say that I am 32-34, but these fit great! They aren't a swimmers' jockstrap but they're nicely low-slung and cradle my nutsac and penis comfortably.

Possibly but it might be a little bulky for him/her. As a Marine for 31 years I love the watch.
I don't think you can wear a watch in bootcamp but it is a sportswatch and its really durable..I would stay away from any sort of marine items until he has graduated boot camp though...semper fi
not at this time unfortunately.
i'd say you'd be good with a medium then. i am an 11 ...i know...big foot! lol!!! and i order the large and the x-l just in case. i use them both anyway so it doesn't matter....it's a great product. you will be happy with them and a great price too! :)
I would suggest you get Large/XLarge. Just to be on safe side. I had these in medium and they wouldn't fit over my boot (which is a size 9). Hope this info helps.
They are useless on black ice or very smooth ice. They slow me down alot when I have to walk on bare concrete in them.
The guys in my office tried on the cleats with their boots which ranged in sizes 10 1/2 - 13 and each one was a perfect fit. So I'm gathering that a less bulkier shoe should be no problem. Hope this helps.
If you'll be wearing over work boots, I recommend you also check out DueNorth's "Lite industrial" and "General Purpose" models. They are mostly the same, same spikes, but sized for fitting well on larger toe and heel of work shoes/boots - they'll stretch on and stay on better for you, I think. I like the light industrial model for my steel toe boots.
I wear a size 9 women's shoe and ordered the L - XL. They fit great. I had ordered another pair (exactly like this) from QVC and they were too small for me. I think I order size 5 - 9 at that time. I'd go with the X-XL. Good luck.
You get one for each foot, with that order. It is worth it, they really work.
I purchased these cleats for my 81 year old mother, who wears size 6 shoe. I ordered the s/m size and she wears them on her boots all winter. They work well and give me some peace of mind, as she will not wait for us to come and shovel the snow for her. I recommend them.
You can find the company's sizing info at this URL: http://www.exofficio.com/images/cust_serv/sizing_chart/ms-chart.png and as you can see, 38 falls into the L size while 40 falls into the XL size. I have about the same waist as you and I use the L size and it fits nicely. Hope this helps.
yes
One. Yeah, they are not cheap, but I liked them so much I ordered enough of them so that I don't wear any other underwear now. I caught them on sale at about $11.00 apiece with free shipping through Prime. Very durable, they wear like iron, they will last several times longer than cotton briefs.
I confirmed that the style I purchased has a fly. Just be sure to read the product description very carefully since there are two styles.
My husband wears a 34-36 in briefs and the large is just fine. He is a 33 waist.
I only ordered one. There were no packages offered when I ordered it.
One in each bag. Individual package.
They look the same but have exofficio on the waistband. They are great and usually a good price on Amazon.
I ordered black, blue, and green. I can see no difference in them. I did notice difference in price, which I attributed to lower price being for the less appealing colors.
nylon yes, lycra I don't think so.
Yes - the pants have straps
There is a layer over the trouser leg in the area that would make contact. I think it is to protect the leg from burn, may even protect the trouser as it is pretty think. Looks like Rino lining.
My husband has worn his the last 2 seasons and it hasn't torn anywhere yet.
Yes one large front pocket with velcro sealer
ANTHONY I am 5'8" 165 lbs. I bought the Medium and it is too big for me, I think that the Large would be ok for you. Anyway I am very happy with the Milwaukee rain suit, is very good quality and is warm for the cold. I hope this information is useful for you to make the decision. good luck
It comes with a bag that can hold the jacket and pants. However, I wouldn't recommend you buy this product. Mine malfunctioned very quickly and I was forced to toss it in the trash. The material is cheap and tears on it own after a few weeks to months depending on your use. It seems to be affected by heat from the motorcycle very easily. I'm currently hoping I can find a better rain suit. Hope this helps.
My husband generally wears a large in clothing so I got an extra large to be sure it would fit over his leather jacket and chaps. It does with room to spare! Plus the waist has elastic and cinches in if it looks too big.
My husband is 6'3" and the X-Large was more than adequate in length with some to spare.
No it's not. I've purchased 2 one for my husband one for myself. Not came same size top and bottoms.

I used a cooler and packed it with dry ice. They come with white plastic moldings and it's best to keep that inside the hat while they are freezing. It's easier to put on and it's best to get an Velcro scrap, so you can make sure the cap is on really good. I put the first cap on 30 min before my infusion and I changed out every 20 min. I made sure to put on a frozen cap 5 min before my chemo. Most people kept on the cap 4 hrs after chemo but I kept mines on 2 hrs after but I was only on taxol and it depends on the drug how well the caps well work. If you go on the breastcancer.org website and go to the forum and search cold caps it's a lot of women who have done this but most used the more expensive caps. Also I used 3 caps and rotating them out and my infusion was only in hour and 20min for premeds. I had to buy and 4 bags of dry ice everytime with 3 caps but if you get more you may need more dry ice. I hope this help and your hair will shed a lot but don't give up because it will work. It's best not to really comb your hair to much while on treatment and wash once a week in cold water about 4 days after chemo sometime I washed every 2 weeks. Use only natural shampoos and I also took biotin and shaiitake mushroom extract it help with hair loss while on chemo. Let me know if you have anymore questions.
Don't use dry ice, just place them in deep freezer at -40f.
I bought 5. That way I could cycle them through the dry ice and they would get cold enough. I don't recall any mention of temperature in the directions. And the thermometer that I bought didn't work well with taking the caps temperature, so I just winged it. It was not perfect, I did lose hair, but I kept enough that most people didn't notice. Best wishes!
Sure thing... We used 2 Igloo 60qt rolling ice chests because of their rugged design and portability (wheels and handle)... The cheaper styrofoam models would probably work too, just harder to transport them from the car to the chemo clinic... Good luck!!
It's a little snug, and it stays cool for 20 to 30 min.
You will need something colder than just ice. The idea is to "freeze" it. Something that cannot be achieved with just a cooler with ice. After taking it out of the freezer it will last 30~40 min.
This isn't something that I use very often, but it does a better job than the double sided regular tape because it is slightly thicker. However, you need to make sure you don't have a lot of cream or lotion on skin or it won't hold as well.
It is the strongest tape for skin and clothes made so if this doesnt work, I dont know what will...it held my strapless bra up and dress down so no gap or cleavage. You will find other uses for it if it does not hold the shapewear, for sure! worth a try... It also held a bra strap in place on my sholder so it would not show under my shirt... Never tried it with shapewear though.
I had a low cut dress on two weeks ago and this tape did not stick at all. I tried several times and I never got it to work and I'm not big at all so I thought the tape would prevent the dress from falling and nope it didn't work
Possibly. I think it would depend on how much pull there is from your skin on the fabric and how much you move. If you try it I would use it in several places; one strip at the hem, etc. probably won't do the trick. And bear in mind that when you sit a skirt is going to rise, it's supposed to, that can easily throw things off if you don't place the tape in just the right place; there will be too much pull and it WILL come loose but taping for a seated position would have your skirt higher and cause wrinkling when you stand. So I honestly don't know, I think this is definitely a trial and error situation.
It would be more of a temporary fix for that. You would eventually have to hem them.
No it does not leave residue and yes the tape removes cleanly. A little tip is to try to remove gently by scraping the edge then lift upwards.
I doubt it would work for that especially! This product didn't help for anything! I learned a trick from s friend she told me carpet tape works great! You can find it at home Depot or Lowe's for cheap!
It works cloth to cloth. Saved me during my job interviews.
No
1xl or 2xl regular
I would say a 4XL
No they dont come with them have to buy them separately
Ripstop has double sticking to prevent Cruch from ripping and taclite is made with thinner material more suitable for the summer wear.
In my opinion, you should be fine with a large waist regular length
You need a medium Regular
if you are 30x32 you need medium long. beware the medium short. is very short!!!!
I'm 6'3 180lbs and have a 33-34 waist. I get the size large/ long length in these pants and they fit great! I would think a size medium or large waist with the regular length should be a good fit for you. Hope this info helps
Sorry to say, that although these are great pants, sizing can be an issue. I wear a 36 waist in jeans, and so bought lg and that seems to fit fine, you may want to try an XL, but make certain you try them on right away in case you have to make a return, as I did first time around. According to 5.11's sizing chart on their site, the size for you would be the top of the "L" or bottom of the "XL" size category - I would go to the higher end, with XL. You can chk 56.11's site and then go from there.
They have a elastic band in them. I wear a 32 in the waist and its tight enough I don't have to wear a belt so I would get the next size up in the waist of I was you
Upon request Monkey Business will send you a repair kit. Follow the link below. Very easy company to deal with... http://www.monkeybusinesssports.com/contactmbs.php
Pretty good I suppose. If using the front rubber bands and the arrow it comes with. It should shoot pretty far.
No, I don't recommend this for indoors. The darts are solid foam unlike nerf darts are and it will definitely break stuff. I mean if your careful it could be a good indoors toy but I don't recommend it.
I don't have the zing but this bow is pitiful...it's not really even a bow...me and my son both were very disappointed.
The original that shoots 100 ft
Not from us.
I ordered one for Christmas back in early November and never got it. It is now Jan. 10.
I guess it would depend on how much strength the 5 year old has. I bought it for my grandsons who are 9 and 11. They didn't have a hard time with it.
Yes! Our boys love it! Their friends all bought one too!
About 5 to 50 years old.
No!! They are not!
Because it's a continuous tube, it slips through your hands when you try to hold/squeeze it.
Actually I've had mine for quite a while and both my kids (ages 8 and 2) play with it and aren't very gentle but haven't popped it yet.
I got one
I believe you could. However it will depend on the optical shop that you use and if they will custom fit the glass to the frame. This would be a question for the optical shop. Don't forget that there may be an extra fee or cost due to the size or customization of the class. But in today's world I don't see a reason why not. Try it. They can only say no at worse. Good Luck.
These are not polarized. Everything else is accurate.
They are glass. If they are polycarbonate, it should be stated in the product description.
That is a good question. I don't think there is a difference. Look on AO website. And know this. I have seen original AO online for around 100 bucks. I have seen them on base for 19. I got mine from Amazon for 40.
I would go with the 55 or 57mm. They look good. Just google image Shane smith vice news. You'll see what I'm saying
I believe they will fit just fine. They fit me when other styles did not fit so good.
Mine were non-polarized, however they do come in a polarized version.
They are gold colored, not gold plated (0.0 karat).
It is amazing glasses. It fit very well. I use this for more than 25 year.
The idea is that true grey reduces the light coming through without altering the color of what you're looking at. Most sunglasses have some type of color tint to them, that will restrict certain colors more than others.
don't know exactly but fit my 5 y/o grandson...it is adjustable hope that helps..it's a nice little hat
Picture is true product.
No
No
I think cotton...It is a great hat for a toddler and fits perfect.
I think it's one size. My son wears a 3T in clothes, and this hat is just a little big on him, if that helps with sizing.
It has a stretchy part in the back. When I bought it for my son it was a little big, but I folded in down and then it fit fine. He is almost five now (with a very large head) and it stills fits fine with a little room to spare.
Well, to some degree, yes. It is a tight porous mesh that would retain about a cup of sea water at the shores edge, but while walking back to your cabana or the bar, there may be a tablespoon or two in each aqua shoe.
I would recommend that you order the size 12 or 12.5. My husband wears a size 11.5 and I bought him the size 11. It fit a little snug at first, but, it stretched quickly once he got in the water
Hi Peter, I think you should get these in size 11, they will feel a little snug, however, once you get in the water they will stretch a little and give you a perfect fit. If you buy them at just the right fit or bigger then they tend to fall off your feet once you get in the water.
I wear an 11 1/2 shoe, and I ordered a 12 just to be sure it was comfortable. The elasticity of the shoe maintained both comfort as well as fit for me. Great aqua shoe, but I would not recommend for long walks on hard pavement like concrete. Short sojourns on paved surfaces are good, and sand and water comfort is excellent. May your opinion match mine after wearing them. Good luck.
Hi Bonnie - I generally wear an American shoe size of 11 1/2, so I ordered a 12. The are very comfortable to walk in both the water and on the beach. Hard pavement is tolerable for a mile or so, but I would switch to sandals or athletic shoes for hard pavement.
Can't give you an exact weight but they are very very light and wonderful to wear. Order larger as they run small
I wear a medium width shoe. The top material of the shoe is made of wet suit material imagine it would fit a wider foot if it was not too wide. I would call the vendor and ask. They were very helpful with my sizing questions.
Mine fit comfortably like a D width. The sides are flexible over the sole, so I believe as long as you were not broaching a Triple E, they should be comfortable.
Yes, either minus using flippers or inside 1-2 size larger flippers. Very comfortable shoe.
A size 10 should be sufficient.
Actually no, I cut the tag off. I seems to be cotton, but there might be something else blended in. It's really comfortable (except for the tag) for a lightweight robe if that helps. If you want something big and thick this isn't it.
No. It's fairly thin, but you can't see through it.
I am 5-10, 195 lbs and the medium/large fits me fine! Should hit his legs just below the knees, so unless you are looking for shorter, that's the one I would recommend.
This robe has a set of belt loops on each side with two possible height adjustments to allow for different torso dimensions.

I wear an 11 1/2 shoe, and I ordered a 12 just to be sure it was comfortable. The elasticity of the shoe maintained both comfort as well as fit for me. Great aqua shoe, but I would not recommend for long walks on hard pavement like concrete. Short sojourns on paved surfaces are good, and sand and water comfort is excellent. May your opinion match mine after wearing them. Good luck.
Hi Bonnie - I generally wear an American shoe size of 11 1/2, so I ordered a 12. The are very comfortable to walk in both the water and on the beach. Hard pavement is tolerable for a mile or so, but I would switch to sandals or athletic shoes for hard pavement.
Can't give you an exact weight but they are very very light and wonderful to wear. Order larger as they run small
I wear a medium width shoe. The top material of the shoe is made of wet suit material imagine it would fit a wider foot if it was not too wide. I would call the vendor and ask. They were very helpful with my sizing questions.
Mine fit comfortably like a D width. The sides are flexible over the sole, so I believe as long as you were not broaching a Triple E, they should be comfortable.
Yes, either minus using flippers or inside 1-2 size larger flippers. Very comfortable shoe.
A size 10 should be sufficient.
Well, to some degree, yes. It is a tight porous mesh that would retain about a cup of sea water at the shores edge, but while walking back to your cabana or the bar, there may be a tablespoon or two in each aqua shoe.

The garment is 32" long, and while I have the tape measure out, about 60 and 1/2 inches wide measuring at the hem :)Valerie
The fit is small. The elastic is snug around chest. Also it is short on me and I'm 5' 3. The picture is not the true fit or length
Yes, I wear 1-2x and it fits fine
feels like cotton...does not shrink...but size runs very small
I'm 5'2" and it hits mid-calf for me.
Yes-- the brim is wide and provides good shade both in front and on the sides. The back flap is soft and hangs down far enough to protect my neck, which is not swan-like but is not especially short either. I am very happy with it for hiking.
I have a size medium, and the brim in front is 4", the sides are a little over 2" at the narrowest part (where they meet with the flap). I find that it provides complete sun protection without obstructing vision. It also fits well under a bike helmet.
I would wear this hat to the beach, but it has a foam core brim which could loose it's shape getting soaked in water. Spot clean for stains.
No it is not removable.
The brim on this hat should be larger to block more harmful rays.
This hat is not sized for children. There is a similar "play" hat that has children's sizes. The size chart is pretty specific to your question.
Yes
At the base of the head, in the back, there is a small belt-like sliding tightener that provides for a wide array of sizes.
I'm not 100% sure but it would seem likely given the material...it seems fairly water proof to me. I've never worn it in the rain so that's why I say I'm not sure. My opinion would be it would work pretty good in the rain but perhaps not if one were to wear it in an all day rain.
Yes you can!
It a tough question to answer as it will depend on type of material. It works amazing on leather, but as far as mane made material it has a very different content every time so its truly hard to tell.
Never tried it on patent leather, but I use the spray on the inside of some of my shoes anyway. You can spray it on the inside leather. This is a good spray.
Do you mean like a leather flip flop/thong sandal? If the sandal is leather it should stretch it. The only concern would be the stitching. We have had TREMENDOUS success w/ this product, but I've never tried it on sandals. I would think it would help cotton stitching stretch too, but I can't promise.
I used it on something similar and had good results.
I did.
Hi, Judy..."Permanent" is a long time so I can't answer that...but so far, 2 mo.s or so, my shoes are doing well. My guess is that it wouldn't be characteristic of leather to shrink once stretched....and the cost of most shoes far outweighs the cost of the potion. Not much to lose since the stuff left no stains or scars. ms
The can says for use on leather, suede, nubuck, and reptile materials, but it is not recommended for man-made materials.
I spray the inside of the shoe, and wear it until it is dry. If spraying cowgirl boots, it work better if you put the boot over the can, right side up, not the can upside down into the boot. Hope this answers your question.
hmmm...I imagine so, but I used mine on some heels and flats. I would think that what I used it on is a tougher material to stretch than the upper material on boots so I would bet it'd work on tall boots too. Hope that helps
Unfortunately, I can't tell if it works at all. I've tried it on canvas and leather with no noticeable difference.
I use mine inside a mascot head where temps easily reach that. It won't work miracles, you will still feel the warmth, but it definately helps alot! It's one of the best I've found so far.
No
Yes
it is not water proof, it dries quickly though.
No it is a synthetic wik away material I don't have any of the tags divest I can do
I've washed mine several times without issue.
Nope. Its a size 5 for male (around 23-24 cm)
Hello Lino: Yes, we have all sizes in stock in this PF Flyer, known as "the Sandlot" in all black. If you have any other questions you can write or call us at 1-877-463-9225. Thank you for shopping with APerfectDealer. Larry Gershberg, website host
It means mens' size 11 medium width. Would be the size of a 13 shoe for women. Alphabet letters before D are narrower widths. E, EE and EEE are wide width. PF Flyers run true to size stated.
It is both a size 8.5 for women and a 7 for men. I normally wear either an 8 or 8.5 depending on the shoe, and these fit me perfectly.
Hi, These are Black shoes
Maybe get a 6 in womens
Yes, unisex would mean a man or a woman could wear it, thus it is a mens shoe. The difference...a woman could also wear it...but men wear high heels sometimes, so do whatever you want.
I think the difference is 2 sizes. A men's 5 would be a women's 7.
Heck no they would not look dumb! PF Flyers rock for any age! ENJOY!
I searched and they aren't on Amazon right now, I have seen them on Amazon a couple of times, these are the same shoes just without the old logo and Sandlot inside sole. I got one of each because I like to preserve my replica editions as long as possible. The replicas are still on pfflyers.com, if you keep checking they might pop back up on Amazon some time, I wish you the best. PF Flyers rule!!!
China is the world manufacturing plant, so, almost everything you buy nowadays is made in China. But quality assurance is in accordance with the requirements by the representing trade. Don't worry about that...my Irish Setter shoes are more than three years old, I have used them a lot and they look like new.
Rodney, I have owned several pair of the Irish Setter Soft Paws and even though the robust leather uppers with occasional polishing show little wear, worn soles necessitated replacement. An Achilles' heel (pun intended) of the shoes is the OEM laces, which do seem to wear/fray too quickly. I too have attempted to obtain replacement laces from Red Wing directly and through local shoe stores, but with no success. I now use the readily available KIWI Outdoor Brand brown laces (product code 2114) in my Soft Paws. They look good and are more robust than the OEMs. As I wear size 14EE shoes, I find the 45" laces are appropriate, but the KIWI laces are available in 36" as well. After the OEM laces wear out, the next component(s) which I have found to need replacement is/are the "Scent Ban" insoles. As a "better than original" replacement, I use the New Balance Pressure Relief Insoles (product code IPR3030). They are pricey, but if you are on your feet for hours, they are worth the money. Because I have been wearing Soft Paws for years now, obviously, I do like the product! Roger
yes
I ordered 13 D and they are true to size.
I also think they may not be waterproof. The 3874 version says waterproof in the info from Irish Setter, and has a Waterproof tag on the upper. This version has neither of these.

I believe that the seal is sewn on. It is certainly not going to be removed easily. The hat is very well made. It would be easier to simply buy an all-blue hat and put the seal on yourself. Regardless, this hat is so well made and attractive that I wouldn't want to change it in any way. I love this hat. It is very smart looking and classy. And durable. I hope this answers your question.
Sorry, our manufacturer only makes Air force with Navy blue, because that is official air force Color, so all air force official licensed products most of time comes with navy blue.. thank you
Don't know
This is an adjustable hat, but intended for an adult size head. I think it would be too large for a 7 year old.
Don't get these. They will be way too big. I'm a women's 7.5 and I had to return them.
I'd say look somewhere else. My boots were way too large. Went thru the process for return authorization and never heard another word from vendor. No boots, no refund.
Both, My boots were so large that I had to return them. They were large enough to cover my shoes twice.
Yes these are designed to be worn over shoes.
This listing is for size 16. There is a listing for each size 7 thru 16.
I wear size 33 or 34 for jeans and I made the mistake of buying the large. It's just a tad bit lose. If you wear a 35 I would get the medium. As for the belt loops I'm not the seller, but they should have a item description otherwise I wouldn't buy it. Another suggestion I have is to go to your local store that sells gear and try a few belts on. Then buy the one you want on amazon.
40???
It will fit up to a 42 easy
Honestly I cant remember but im a size 34-36 (38 in the winter &#55357;&#56841;). It fits me just fine but with the extra belt length you could expand it out to like 52 and down to 30 i assume.
The xl worked for me and I'm a 40-42. It could expand to a 46
40
Sizing Information SMALL (26"-30") MEDIUM (32"-36") LARGE (38"-42") EXTRA LARGE (46"-48")

No. I squeeze a 54 gauge into with the plastic. Anything bigger would be pushing it.
Depends, it is a hard tube wrapped with leather, so it can't be stiched. A few options: embossed, branded, or small brass plate glued on the side or round medallion style on the top. I like the idea.
When the 2 pieces are fully inserted into each other, it measures just 5 1/2 inches so this would be the minimum. The maximum would be 8" with the case fully extended.
The single leather cases can take up to 58 Ring Gauge, while the triple leather cases can take up to 54 Ring Gauge.
I don't think so, my husband just puts laptop note book and his chargers. Good luck.
I guess that would depend on how much stuff you need to bring and whether you are carrying a laptop as well. Regrettably, the way the compartments are organized, you would have difficulty putting in anything but your computer and whatever documentation you need to bring. Albeit, this is an excellent bag that is very well made, it is best suited as a mobile office and not a weekend bag. Hope this answers your question.
My husband says yes, he is currently using it to carry all of the above and travels extensively.

Derek, I didn't know so read the description under Foredom Hammer Hand Piece which gave me this "Close bezels and heavy prongs, set stones in channels and create unique textures with this handpiece". So it's a jeweler's jackhammer.

The unit itself is not heavy . To me it feels about 3-pounds but I have it on a hook stand designed for it by the manufacturer so the motor part is never handled. Shipping now a days is a different story. We have large sections of foam weighing only 7-pounds that fits inside a box made for a case weighing 40-ponds but the shipping cost of the 7-pound foam is based on the cost of the box size and is the same cost as the shipping cost for the 40-pound case even though only a 7-pound piece of foam is in side. The entire shipping industry is this way now. I hope I helped you with this. Now a days when you order something, don't look at the total weight. It will always throw you for a loop. If weight is important, only look at the actual weight of the item itself. Contact the person / company and ask for the weight of the item itself if that information is not given in the description.
Yes we have 220 volt its $15.00 more
I work with copper and being a soft metal almost any metal bit will work. I bought this kit a few years ago and I understand they added more accessories. You can buy metal bits at any hardware store and you will need a variety of sizes. Also they do break so plan on buying many! Foredom makes one of the best flex shafts.
Great box - use it for storage. Measures 18" wide x 12" deep by 4 1/2" tall. Hope this helps.
No you can't. The headpiece only accepts up to 5/32". You will need to upgrade to an extra handpiece with a larger collet or bit opening.
I would describe it as the warm brown walnut, a little darker than pictured, not as solid or dark as the typical espresso finish. It's really lovely and goes with lots of decor. I've had a million compliments on it, too, for style and function. Love this piece.
No assembly required. However, it is quite heavy and it would be good to have a helper to help hold it while mounting it. Plastic anchors and screws are included for drywall mounting. If you are mounting it on a hollow core door, you will need suitable anchors of the right length (not too long) that will expand when tightened.
you could put medium to large bangles in it, there are only two small trays at the bottom that really do no hold much
Hi Mary , no, I don't believe so.....however, it's truly awesome! LOVE it so much!

The one I have is just a flat piece of glass with the wood frame around it. There are no bevels on the edges.
9.75 x 44 inches
About 4-5 inches deep.
A small luggage lock
It's small about 6in tall 9in wide
No,it does not have any kind of strap. Only strap it has is to support the tripod.
This will of course depend on whether you are talking about a full size SLR and long lenses or something more compact. I recommend you lay out your equipment on a table and see if you can fit it within the TT airstream internal dimensions. Don't forget the dividers will take up 1/2 an inch each.
No problem. I've traveled with Nikon D800 (full frame)with 14 24 and 28 300 and 50 plus sony nex-7 with several lenses plus chargers, filters, etc. Travels well and fits in ALL overhead luggage compartments....even on some pretty darn small planes. Sturdy and great wheels. Hope that helps.
It should, depends on the overall length of the 400mm lens. The Canon 400mm f2.8L will fit in the bag. After that lens though, you might not have much room other gear. I returned mine because I could not get my two bodies, 3 zoom lenses (24-70 f2.8, 70-200 f2.8 and 100-400 f4.5-5.6) and my flashes into it. I did get the Airport International instead and all my gear fit with some room to spare.
I would take a guess it's about 2-3lbs give or take.
These lightsabers said have a string of LEDs across the length of the blade. They cannot be replaced, but they last for thousands of hours of use.
It's white
On a Plane? Yes.
You sure can, there is a cap on the very bottom. Untwist it slide out the battery clip. It takes 3 AA batteries.
Yes we can!
It stays on until the batteries run out. Kind of an expensive decoration and alot of batteries. You might want to look at one you could plug in a wall or something
its not removable
hi my friend..the lightsaber is a toy...the intensity of the light is only to iluminate the bar...in the dark it seems intensive...I use the lightsaber once in a while so the batteries last more than 10 months (it depends of the use)..the sound can not be turned off...the user only turn the toy on /off with a slider switch (and sounds with some moves) but sound is automatic..its a wonderful toy
It has sound and it's pretty loud actually. You can't use it as a nightlight because of how loud it is.
I purchased the black one. It's true as described. But I don't know the color you asked. Maybe you can try google the pictures to see most backpack with the color you want
Hi. The nice thing about tho model of Think Tank is that it is fully configureable to your needs. I am not familiar with the dimensions of the 400/2.8- suggest that you measurement of the interior dimensions of the case against your lens. I use two Airport Security bags to haul 70-200/f2.8, two d800s, 9 more lenses, plus 6 sb900s battery oaks ; and have at times used them to carry a couple of Aline Bee 640s , batt packs and various grip equipment. Good luck!
Yes on most airplanes, but not on the smaller ones. It is an excellent piece of luggage. I recommend it.
It does, but it's the outside pocket. I don't put my laptop in it. Maybe if you had a heavy sleeve.
My 70-300 does.
Yes, but some smaller aircraft will require you to gate check this bag. I went to Russia and back with the bag weighing nearly 50 pounds and didn't have any issues until a commuter hop where I had to gate check. It was fine.
5.8 kilograms
We sell both the Airport Security and the Airport Takeoff. They are similar. The Security is a little bigger and the Takeoff has backpack straps for additional carrying option.

It was not the color I was expecting - and I was hoping for a "true red". Mine had a bit of a raspberry look, but was probably closer to red than raspberry.
No they are not made for that purpose. They are strictly a walking shoe
It is more maroon than a true brown across the toes. A dark brown around the ankle.
Dark purple. Actually, I would call it magenta.
Yes they were true to size and fit perfectly.
I bought them for my special lady friend and she has had them for 4 months and logged around 40 miles in them including streets and hiking on a rocky trail, and the velcro remains in tact.
Yes. I usually wear a 9 and the 9 fits perfectly. If the shoe is wide I can wear an 8-1/2. These are very comfortable, I highly recommend them.

That depends on the temperature. The ones that are worn in our production assembly area stay cool for several hours but the temp in that area stays around 76-79 degrees F. The ones in our welding shop, don't stay cool but for about 2 hours but the temp in that area can be 108 degrees F. Hope this helps.
I threw it away after one use, it was so slimey. It leaks out some gel stuff. it did not work that great. ended up buying the frogg toggs cool towel which works better and is washable.
The bandana tag only has the Chill Its name on it. No other information. Don't have the original packaging available.
Hi That would be tiny. the smallest child size we carry is 8. Just curious, how old is a child that is size 6?
Hi Here is a conversion chart. I believe it is quite accurate.... See below. Big Kid Size Conversions (7 - 12 years) US Sizes Euro Sizes UK Sizes Inches CM 3.5 35 2.5 8.625" 21.9 4 36 3 8.75" 22.2 4.5 36 3.5 9" 22.9 5 37 4 9.125" 23.2 5.5 37 4.5 9.25" 23.5 6 38 5 9.5" 24.1 6.5 38 5.5 9.625" 24.4 7 39 6 9.75" 24.8
An inch. Like a tap shoe. Not too high.
Hi, I am sorry but we do not sell size 7.
Yes we can. We just sent about 22 pairs to Amazon to have stock. We will not have any more for about 6 weeks.
No, I would say it fits toddler 13 to youth 1
toddler size 8
Hi , No they come in amny sizes. We have shipped more inventory to Amazon last week to fill new orders. Thanks
I would get her whatever her shoe size is. For example, my daughter wears either a size 11 or 12. I got her a size 12 to give her a little room and I thought if they were a little big she could just wear heavy socks. They fit her perfectly. If you don't know her size, call a local shoe store and find out what an 8 in foot would fit into.
I bought a children size 13 19.6cm ...it would then go into an adult size 3 or 4 I think which they did not carry....I THINK
Hello Sharon, I bought these for my daughter who is 6yrs old and she loves them. I would only tell you that these do have a small heal and at her young age it may be difficult for her to walk in them unless you plan to use them under adult supervision. I hope this answered your question.
They are play shoes, for dress-up play, and not really for wearing anywhere. In that respect the size doesn't matter. My granddaughter loves then but after a week the sole was hanging off. I'm going to glue it back on.
Hi Yes, order the size 12. With socks they will fit fine with some room to grow. Thanks
I ordered a size up and they were a little too big I would order her reg size
Hi - I am so sorry, the largest size we carry for kids is a 3.

Sizing chart is a little confusing, but here is how to read it: size ----- XS - S - M - L - XL - 2XL - 3XL waist --- 23 - 25 - 29 - 33 - 37 - 39 - 41 hip ------ 33 - 35 - 39 - 43 - 47 - 49 - 51 inseam - 29 - 29.5 - 30.5 - 31.5 - 32.5 - 33.5 - 33.5 Hope this helps. Looks like my spacing got messed up after I filed it, but I hope you can still figure it out.
I'm sorry, I no longer have them.
It's in the product description.
Large fit over my 10 1/2 ex wide shoe very easily and seems to fit well
This type of boot is an overboot that should fit easily over dress shoes (no overly pointy shoes or cowboy heel boots) but trying over sport shoes is a little more difficult cause it depends on type of sport shoes (low cut tennis works but mid-cuts & b-ball high-tops may not). I don't like these boots due to the buttons in front thats needed in order to fold the excess rubber flap which when closed and buttoned up the flap rubs against the shin on both legs, even with long pants on. I want to return them back to amazon. It's better to buy the Tingley brand that has closure flaps on the side. With Tingley's as a British or European brand you'll need to order X-Large if used as an overboot and don't use the sizing info you'll see on screen w/ the description or Amazon's pop-up chart because the conversions don't apply to overboots in general but do buy directly from Amazon if wrong size order'd so you can exchange.
I use them over my size 11 Georgia composite toe boot. They are a bit difficult for me to get on, but once they are on I have no discomfort. I would say they will work fine with your boots.
Yes
Mine are just a little taller than my hiking boots.
No they are not specified
Thick and flat
Yes
yes, although the boot may be a bit too large for that length wise. i wear a 11.5-12 and it is still roomy in it
My husbands foot is a 10 1/2 wide and it's fits perfect and snug. You might try the large it might fit ok. But like I said it was snug. If they carry an xlarge I would try that that for 11.
More than likely a medium.
No, but now that you mention it, I had to look, and none of the 8 other pairs of cycling shorts I own (cheap or expensive) have a removable liner.....I don't think i've ever seen a pair with a removable liner.
Draw string along with elastic.
Yes. I normally wear a size 35. The large was neither too tight nor too loose.
No safety warning on bags.
270 bags per roll
Hi Cindy, I am sorry to see that happening to you. We have the same product for $56.99 plus free shipping. Its also available in Prime. Let me know if this helps you out. Here's the link to our product page..
There is no information on the box as to where they are made. They are good quality, if that matters.
I don't know. I haven't opened them yet. I'm selling dozens of barely used jackets on Amazon with these. Ask the seller in the "contact the seller" button.
They are clear
Hi Emilia. The bags sold by Plasticplace are clear and only clear. I can't say for sure regarding the other sellers.
The Shock Doctor line of supporters and cups have proven to be very comfortable for me. I use them in my MMA sparring and have so far had experienced only minimal interference in my range of movements. I would recommend to actually try several brands/styles/sizes and find what best works for you in your preferred sport. I myself went through two-strap, thong, and compression short/briefs styles of athletic supporters before I settled for this model in the Shock Doctor series. I hope this helps.
B/L. Boys large age 14-16 year A/M. Adult medium. 30-32 inch....
Haven't tried, but I'd assume it is. The shell itself is plastic with small rubber elements. It's quite easy to hand wash in fact.
Yes, but if positioned incorrectly can hurt them, I always wear with a pair of compression shorts and it works out nicely
I myself haven't done any weight-lifting with a j-strap and cup on, but I can imagine doing so in this garment without any issues.
i have a 31/ 32 waste and I got a medium i would go with that
Yes absoluty. I use mine for Krav Maga.
Yes
Xl
Don't know but the carbon flex is the best one I've used by far. It takes quite a beating in krav maga but I still got 2 kids so it's protecting well.
I have a 34 waist. After reading the reviews which stated that you needed to order one size bigger to get the proper fit, I bought one in the large (34 to 37 inch) size. Works perfectly for me!
This item does not come in youth sizes, it is only availble in adult sizes. Below is a sizing chart to assist you better. S (27" - 29") M (30" - 32") L (33"-35") XL (36"-39") XXL (40"-44")
I don't believe it would work for biking' I think it would it wrong on the seat. Although I have not tried it biking myself. I hope this helps' good luck.
Its geared towards baseball, but running in it for baseball has not caused chaffing. But with that being said I played soccer for years and I would say this at some point would get uncomfortable and probably would at some point bother the person.
This is by waist size not your junk size so based off a 30in waist a medium should be fine
It seems that there was a glitch in the system. We do have this item available in the large. We will get this added as soon as possible.
Medium for me
The only International Shipping that we offer is to Canada. Due to the cost of shipping to Portugal being so expensive we have to cancel orders. With our agreement with Amazon, we cannot contact customers about any additional shipping and charge this since we do not have any of your payment information.
Yes. The cup also has rubber grab points. So, once it's in the pocket it doesn't shift or move.
The medium. ... The item runs true to waist size.

It works great on anything. Shoes, boots, gloves, helmets (with the right attachments, of course) are all dried in minutes.
It works great on big goalie gloves so I think it would work well on ski gloves too. I don't think it would do much for knit gloves or hats though. Hope that helps!
"fan has to run"
You have to set the timer. It will run for 4 hours max.
you dont HAVE to - We have stuck our gloves on the included boot end, and it works just fine. with no attachment, the gloves can fly off - amusing, but not useful!!
does not sound defective. it should be above room temp but I'm not sure the target temp. Mine is noticeable that it is warmer than environment but it is not hot. (have to ask.... heat is turned on?) It should not be hot because it might damage some materials and change the fit of a glove or boot.
They do continue to blow air out. It is a relatively low volume of air, so it is fairly quiet. Mine has worked very well for my heavy off road motorcycle boots. Dries them out over night without overheating the material.
Don't have ski shoes but it works great for my husband's hunting boots :) I don't know how I lived without this before. Love it! Hope it helps :)
It inclludes the 4 boot drying attachments as pictured
If your model has both air and heat settings, we find the heat setting does the trick within 1 hour
What do u mean by that? It's just a regular sized backpack I guess not small or too big
Sorry, no it doesn't PixelPusher.
Its all mesh. You will get wet.
Yes just 1... you can actually see it in this pic. It's the solid pocket you see the the mesh. No side pockets, but a big front one. Hopes this helps.
Yes it is it's has holes on the bottom as well it would be perfect!

I bought the sz small for my sons school show & it fit just shy of being perfect. My son is 6 yrs & wears a sz 6, he's small for his age about 40lbs & 3'7" if that helps,the only thing I had to adjust was the hat so FYI this runs on the small side. The jacket is a stiff polyester but the pants & vest are a very thin rayon. My son had this on the entire school day & it was still in solid condition that eve, so it was worth the money as far as I was concerned.
Child. My kindergarten nephew wore it.
The bow tie does, the yellow vest is part of the outer one, and I do not remember on the gloves
Yes it is for 4-6 sz. My son was 4 when I got it and it was a llitle big but nothing I couldn't fix with some sewing.
Sounds right
Typically a size 4-6 fits a 4 to 6 year old. My nephew wore that size when he was 5 and it was a bit big.
I use them for night driving to reduce the glare from headlights
Yes, they, like other sunglasses, even though they're yellow. They're also better for cloudy days or even dark, because 5 hey cut glare without the darkening effect of other sunglasses.
the reason I bought them here is because I could find them at my eye doctor. But I can tell you this, I used these over my prescription glasses during a 9 hour gun course on a sunny day and did not squint once. They kept my vision sharp and clear. Also, since these glasses protect your eyes on all sides, you do not have to be concerned about empty shells hitting your eyes from another gun being fired next to you if you are in a gun training class.
I use them for night driving to minimize glare and they've never fogged up. I can't say for the shooting range.
No, these glasses are just basic yellow safety glasses. They help with sharpening eye sight in the light, but nothing more.
They should be fine without glasses. My friends use mine and never have a problem. However, if you plan on being pretty active, you might want to purchase regular sized eye protection just to be sure.
Yes they will. I have average size rx glasses and they fit fine.They aren't a fashion statement, but they work great
I have very wide feet, and they fit well in regards to width.
35.3cm. 14inches. They are 12inches at the back of my leg from the heel. Gorgeous boots btw. Had mine 2 years now.
I ordered size smaller than my regular shoe size and they're a perfect fit.
Measures 10.25inch x 7.5inch x 8.75inch when closed.
It depends on the size of the watch and the bulkiness of the band. The drawers are 3/4ths of an inch deep, so unless you have extremely thin watches, I wouldn't recommend it.
the box is the only part that has a lock.
There are two plastic inserts for earrings on the top right.
Gold
Yes
I doubt it....mine seems ok. .but it's only been a little over a month since I put mine in there. .I hope this was helpful. ..
I don't know that the Zuca Pro is a Sport Frame. I don't believe I said that it is. I do know that the Zuca Pro meets TSA Carry-On Standards. Documentation that came with mine says that it is guaranteed to meet those standards.
Mine came with all the included bags--5 "drawers" plus one clear TSA complaint bag for toiletries, etc. It also came with a protective cover which I use when I check it through baggage. The bags are a FANTASTIC way to pack. I can literally go for 4 days on a business trip with this set up. I know of no other carry on that makes it this easy. I think it's no suprise that a lot of flight attendants use this bag. FWIW, Zuca has a new Travel bag called the Flyer. It's designed to be easier to get into overhead storage bins. I've had a bit of trouble on certain planes (generally when I'm in the far front or far back of the plane) with the Zuca not going in easily. Be aware that there is quite a bit of variance in overhead storage bins--even on the same plane. If it won't fit in the first place you try, move a couple of rows and try a new bin.
Cannot answer this.but i have both models and simply love them.me and the wife can fit all our stuff in one f or them for the week end.
The door zipper go around 3/4 of the way.the door is hold to the suitcase from the bottom.it like a flap.
The pro "drawers" have a label slot on the handles for identification of what's in a given bag. They are also sized differently: 4 identical, one smaller. The Pro Travel has 5 "drawers" that are sized 2 x-large, 1 large, 1 medium, 1 small, plus 1 clear TSA compliant quart-size bag for toiletries.

I checked with my daughter and she said it plays "My Old Kentucky Home." My 5 year old grandson loves and stashes his treasures in it.
It was a gift and I don,t remember. Sorry&#128530;
if the circumfrence of your hand at the knuckles measures 8 and 1/4 inches that would put you right in the middle of size large. if its the measurement of your pallm from end of wrist to tip of driving finger i believe that would put you into XL range.
These fit true to size. Hatch has a sizing chart on their website. I think you'll need a large if I remember right. If you get some of the other styles with the Kevlar lining, you'll need to go up a size.
The bearings are spread out so in a way it would help-they sort of turn your fist into one more dense contact point. They are more protect your hand. They do not interfere w/ grappling more than any other snug leather glove would.
Yes, if you do that then you are a moron.
No these are weighted gloves though they fit well I don't think I'd use them while shooting
Punching without damaging your knuckles.
Hi Four draws function. I wish I had known that. I assumed all functioned. But the top opens and there is a lot of storage there and that takes up the top small draw. The two bottom draws are actually one door and has a large storage space for items that wouldn t fit into the draws (such as boxes). There are four doors on the sides for necklace storage (lots of space). I have a lot of jewelry and it is sufficient for my use. I just would have preferred all drawers. Hope this helps you. It s a nice heavy well made piece of furniture!!
The base and back is solid wood - the rest is pressed boards. The pressed boards are of high density making the overall unit pretty heavy (and sturdy).
The height is 41 inches, width is 16 inches and the depth is 12 inches.
It's not lockable.
About 10-12 inches.
For the most part, yes. You have put on the legs & the top lid with screws. The only tool you'll need I believe is a screwdriver. It was pack pretty well to prevent damage.
two are 1.5" and two are 3", my wife loves it and there is a lot of room.
It doesn't come with a lock but my wife loves it.
Yes... the whole thing comes with this price... best thing about this product is it is very easy to assemble... literally pretty out of the box with 10 minutes of work...
I just did a little test to answer your question. I soaked mine in a glass of water until they were sopping wet. First of all, they are considerably harder to install onto your glasses when wet, so I recommend doing that before getting them wet. But once they were on, they held on just as well as when dry, if not better. So you should have no problem.
by itself, yes. attached to glasses, it will probably not have enough buoyancy to keep them afloat too.
They should work Great!
Yes my son plays baseball!!! In them they are excellent
Yes
I should have ordered XL and didn''t so I had to work with this and never did get it to fit. Good luck if you can get it to work for you.
Yes. The sides are stretchy and accommodate wide and thin frames
I have frameless glasses with thin stems. Hold my glasses snug. Don't do anything much more intense than hiking tho.
The only adjustment is to push them further up on the arms, but they tend not to stay since they are not rubber!
Yes
Small, I bought one size up. I got an Xl instead of a large, because its so tight. as far as how the shirt is on the body , it is form fitting like an under armour shirt. For the fit on the gun it fits up to a full size glock 22 . Hope this helps, if not let me know
The holster on this shirt is designed to fit a wide range of pistol sizes. The pockets are very deep and easily conceal both my H&K USP40 Compact and my full size Signal Sauer 226. Of course, like any holster, the bigger the gun the bulkier the feel. That's not to say that it is uncomfortable, but a careful wardrobe selection is important to hide the extra bulk. The last thing to consider is the weight of the gun. Though this holster helps evenly distribute the weight on each shoulder, carrying bigger pistols can become taxing on the body for longer periods of time. Also, the pocket openings are sealed by two velcro patches and my heavier pistols can get them to separate with a little less vigorous activity than my smaller ones, things such as running. All in all, with the design of the holster pockets on this shirt I have been able to successfully conceal sub-compacts, compacts, and full size pistols alike.
I bet it will... Of course depends what you're wearing over it and your body shape if it prints or not. But as for the gun size yes. Those holster pockets are so big they can hold a cannon!
No..it's a heavy duty shirt & reinforced in the holster areas, but wouldn't stop a knife.
Yes

If you go to 5.11 Tactical's Home page and scroll to the bottom, there is a link to click on called Size Charts, but I'm not sure if this chart holds true to these shirts. It has been my experience that these shirts run pretty true to size and they are made for a snug fit, similar to under armor. Hope this was helpful.
I believe it will.I carry my star firestar45acp.comfortable concealed.
This is just a shirt. So yes it works, not worth the money IMO.
No, I choose my color soley based on what color over shirt in wearing. It's a great cc tac shirt that I use even in the office!

About five inches deep and three across; big enough to hold an iPhone comfortably.
The legs have the holes to put draw strings in. I have looked into to this but have not found anything ready made with toggles. I have 4 of these now in different colors and I wear to work. They're very comfortable and functional. I work in an office of mining people and it fits in perfectly with those others wearing plain jeans.
I have not ran any endurance races in them, but I do work as an EMT and wear them as my uniform pants. I have had a couple pairs for almost 2 years now and they are still going strong after being in mud, dirt, you name it and beat to crap, very durable! The Teflon coating wears off after a couple months but they still are pretty stain and fade resistant. Hope this helps a bit!
yes they are, there heavy duty pants that most of the contracters use in iraq where its 115+ i hike the grand canyon in them last year and it was really hot. these pants are almost like wearing shorts
They do dry quickly, but I would say they do not wick away moisture. But they do not get real heavy when they are wet like cotton does.. Hope this helps.
Inseam...I've never seen a pant measured any other way.
well the 40 waist was right, have you measured the 32? i guess its the luck of the draw with what you get.
I would describe them as medium dark grey. 0 being total black, 5 being middle grey, 10 being pure white, I would call these a 2.5. The 5.11 website also has another colour called storm, which appears to be lighter.
they look blue in the picture, but they are VERY dark, almost to the point of black
Absolutely not, lol

No it does not have arm pit zippers.
I would say no. And it fits a lil snug.
It's roomy in the chest to accommodate a vest and several articles of clothing.
No. It's just a jacket by itself. Very nice and very warm. I love mine!
As far as chest and arms - medium is fine, but I'm a little concerned about your hight... I'm 5'10 (40" chest) and medium fits me fine in terms of length (waist etc.), but in mid section there is still plenty of room (for bigger guys). So, I think you should go M unless you want jacket to cover you below waistline.
I don't know exact measurements but they do run big. You shouldn't have a problem. I ordered a 2x because I was worried about size. I'm a pretty big guy. 5'10" 300lbs. And if I loose much weight at all I'm going to have to order a new because this one will be way too big

16 inches at the top, they have a slight taper to the ankle! The BEST winter snow boot I have ever purchased and believe me I have had many!
They rinse well but do get a lighter look from the mud after awhile. In other dirt and mud they rinse well. Mine are well used. I have worn them to the barn 2 times a day to feed cattle and horses for almost 2 years. They don't look like boots to go out in but have kept my feet warm and dry which is what I wanted. They are much lighter weight than other boots which is great when you have a distance to walk.
Yes, here is the link for both USA sizing and European http://www.bogsfootwear.com/shop/sizingInfo.html
Weight is 4 pounds per pair. Much lighter than MUCK boots.
Black
The boot is 15" high according to the BOGS web site. On me it sits just under the natural bend of your knee. Their website has additional information. I think you will love these boots for your trip but I would bring warm wool socks also. I have had BOGS on the farm for the past 6 years and my feet have never been cold although when it is below 25 degrees I wear wool socks. Now we just need them to make gloves :)
They seemed true to size, but the bigger issue was that they looked like Herman Munster shoes, SO big and bulky. I returned them.

I Googled it and found that in women's shoes, B/M is considered medium and C/D is considered wide. http://shoes.about.com/od/fitcomfort/a/widenarrowwidth.htm Hope this helps.
I use them for walking only. The arch isn't very high, but they are comfortable and I've had 5 pairs over the years. Because of the mesh they are good if you have problems in the big toe area (like bunions).
no these have not left any marks on none of the floors i walked on
Actually my foot measures a 5 1/2 but I ordered the 6 M and they fit great
They are very lightweight and fit very well! My second pair. Just love them.
I am a 9.5 wide but I end up buying the 10 medium when the 9.5 W isn't available.
The arch is the best I've found as far as height, but unfortunately for me/my size, the arch was about 1/4 of an inch too far back and therefore hit my heel instead of my arch. I had to return them for that reason. I wear a 10 wide, so ordered an 11. The most comfy shoe yet except for the positioning of the arch. Maybe your size would be fine. It's worth a try since its such a comfy shoe with a high arch.
Yes, I wear orthotics and need a W shoe - these work perfectly.
I don't find them to be any higher in the back for support. In fact, I have a heel spur on the back of my foot and they are very comfortable on it. I have wide feet and 2 heel spurs and these are the most comfortable sneakers I've found. Had no trouble walking all over Disney! If you have any foot "issues", I think these would be a good sneaker to try.
Didn't see the question. Very nice fit and I have a wide foot. I haven't done trails but I get my miles in weekly. I keep a spare pair available!

Depends on your foot size. My husband wears a 12 1/2 and they fit about 1/2 the way from his ankle to his knee.
The Terries Slip Resistant Socks stretch but I do not believe they would stretch over a leg cast. You will need to find a slip resistant product designed for a cast.
regular athletic sock
I take a size 11 (men's) shoe. So I always try to get an extra-large size in these slip resistant socks, at least. I've found that socks like these which may be issued to an in-hospital patient, have always been too small. The socks will stretch somewhat, but, I feel that it's better to have a large size that you don't have to stretch to make fit. The color doesn't matter to me.
Hello Howard. I am not a physician, nor am I a professional physical therapy person. Therefore, I strongly suggest you discuss the swollen ankles problem with your doctor. He/she can make recommendations. I pray for your well-being.
I would think so, as long as you put gradual pressure on it, to avoid tearing the shoe. I used it on an 8 wide athletic / hiking shoe with excellent results, but tightened some, let is sit for 10-12 hr, then tried it and tightened some more.
YES
If your purpose is to widen your shoes, this stretcher will do the job. My tight shoes problem was solved.
Everything appears to be metal. I was cautious about plastic units breaking, which is why I went with this one. So far, it has held up really well, and is very sturdy (and heavy). I could probably use it as a weapon in a pinch. :)
No. It only stretches width
Here is a quote from my review on the product: "It fits my hard-cover Bible (9 3/16 x 6 1/8 x 2) perfectly. I'm doubtful that anything bigger than that can fit in this Bible cover." So your Bible may be too big to fit in this case.
Mine measures approximately the same as yours . I didn't measure because I bought the bible @ same time and the bible fits easily with a song book and steno notebook inside ,too !
Yes it does. It is a very nice leather case.
It fits my 9 by 6. It may be a little tight for yours.
I have a NIV Life Application Study Bible by Zondervan that fits nicely into this cover with a little room to spare.
Yes
There is one pocket on either of side of the inside that holds the Bible in place within the zippered area. There is a separate zippered area on the outside and a strong velcro flap pocket that could hold cards.
My Bible measures 9 1/8 by 6 3/16 by 2 1/8. I feel like this cover is close to custom-made for my Bible 'cos you can't fit anything bigger or thicker into it. The content is more previous than the cover itself. %)
Lny, No, I don't believe your Bible will fit based on the dimensions of your Bible and the cover which I actually measured - dimensions are same as those given by Amazon -10'' x 7'' x 2'' .
I purchased this cover, along with another one, but haven't used this one yet. I have been using this type of cover for years for novels I am reading and they work great for that. But I am afraid it might be a very tight fit for your Bible, if it fits at all. I measured the inside and it seems to measure just under 10 inches, so it might be hard to get the Bible in it. I wish I had something close to that size to try, but I don't. I hope you find one that fits and will work for you. I love protecting the books the best I can, plus it makes it so much easier to carry it when your hands are full.
I think 1 pair only. They are just little but expensive but they are good quality
Yeah, they are no-show. Picture is misleading.
They are thinner. They hold up well from a durability stand point but do not add a lot of additional padded comfort
Both, although I believe I've seen women specific ones
http://darntough.com/customer-service/faqs#sizing my son is a shoe size 9 and we sized up to the large based on others' comments; they fit fine. (medium may've been too small)
darn tough vermont is in merino wool in black and red colors. darn tough vermont socks i bought are for men.
No, not padded
Perhaps! My head is about 22" and the hat is plenty snug. I hope it will stretch somewhat, but who knows.
Just measured mine. 3 1/2 in front and back and 2 3/4 in on the sides
Yes - I'm a 7 5/8" hat size and it fits me. Snug at first, but it loosens up, kinda like blue jeans- if you know what I mean.
I drape it over the back of the brim. It's easy to keep it out of the way.
I have two other sun hats - one with a stiffer brim than the Slogger and one with a floppier brim. Would describe the Slogger as moderately stiff and not really floppy. I haven't washed my Slogger yet, but given fabric, stitching, and other construction features, I anticipate it will hold it's shape with washing.
It's very lightweight and has sweatband to absorb if you perspire. I have a heavier cotton one and even though this one is nylon it breaths well. Also dries fast
have been using the hat for a while now. it's a and relative form preserving.
From brim to crown is about 3.5 inches
It is really adaptable (it would probably fit you well). It's a good hat, but it won't protect you if the sun comes sideways. I also think you can find prittier hats for women.
The fabric is Paratex dry fabric, Paratex Dry is a 100% waterproof fabric (Hydrophillic Polyurethane Coating). It feels like thick plastic.
Agree with you, it is difficult, roll as tight as possible before stuffing, grasp bag edge with thumb and forefinger, then use remaining digits to work pancho into sack.
I am 5'3" tall and it was quit long on me and large, I loved it though, enough to buy another one. I hiked/backpacked through France and Spain in the Spring and it definitely did it's job of keeping me dry. I do have to say if it is hot you will sweat buckets under it. But I really love this poncho. The sleeves are great.
Not sure but im 6ft 185 lbs and this thing is a dress. Its designed to wear over a pack to keep you and the pack dry, doubles as an emergency shelter as well when rigged up right.
Bought mine to carry in my back pack. It is really light weight and is stuffed into a small sack. Would guess its less than 1/2 lb.
No it does not.An easy solution is to place a small stone in the desired grommet spot and wrap parachute cord on the outer part to create a emergency anchor .
I looked on this site & see that a string of these lights is $4.34 plus s/h of .49 cents; total is $4.83. I bought some online a year or so ago, don't remember who the seller was. It seems to me that they were around $2 per string. I stored them somewhere in the basement and cannot find them now that Christmas is upon us!
AG3 batteries included and one extra set
Yes. There are three settings. Quick flash Slow fade Constant on
If you order from someone with a fixed shipping rate, it will cost the same as shipping just one.
Yes
No
Hi! If you place the entire order with a seller who has a fixed shipping rate, and plenty in stock, (that's us!) we can help no problem. You'll be charged a flat rate for any size order regardless of weight or number of products.
Possibly but it is an actual necklace so you wouldn't be able to make a string of lights
yes
It uses two CR1220 batteries, (included.)
http://www.sunpentown.com/ucshbu.html the replacement part number is 70001 for $40.00.
It is a plug in. This roller is powerful. You would not want one that operates off a battery because its efficiency would diminish. Hope this helps.
120 V
The manufacturer only has the red and black buffers available for UC-989. Please review the manufacturer website link listed below. http://www.sunpentown.com/repaforshbu.html You may purchase it at http://www.amazon.com/SPT-PAD-989-UC-989-Replacement-Buffers/dp/B00TJ69IBS/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1425932450&sr=8-2&keywords=uc-989+replacement+buffer
No. We do not ship to Spain.
The only thing I see on the paperwork is this: Power:95W Weight: 3.3kgs/Input power: 120V/60HZ. Hope this helps.
It's only input for 120VAC
I use both.

apply the polish the same as you would as if you were going to polish your shoes by hand.
Absolutely, a must have piece if performance is of concern..
PhantomNeal is correct - this version only displays FPS. However Chrony also makes an "Alpha" version that allows you to switch between FPS and MPS by holding the "FU" button while powering it on. So if you need both metric and imperial, I suggest that version. I hope that helps.
The answer is yes to all of the above. If the sun is very bright, no overcast, you'll need the screens positioned to cover the electric eye sensors. the metal rods are to support the plastic screens....all included
no it does not
I've not tried it, fluorescent lights are not supposed to work well because of the way they flicker wit the AC frequency. I believe there is a light kit available to fit these models for indoor use.
Yes, there is a digital display. For readouts less than 100 fps, it has 2 decimal places, From 100.0 to 999.9 fps, one decimal place. 1000 fps or more, it shows only whole numbers. I am very satisfied with my Chrony.
It does have a tripod mount.
The detached digital readout can't be added to the regular F1 without some creative wiring and voiding the warranty. It does have a plug for the printer which can also be utilized by the remote power button to display the low, high, range, standard deviation, average, and shot #.
Kevin: Better check with Amazon. If you're able to provide specific dates of use and detailed results, no product damage along with original packing material they MIGHT allow a return. They're usually pretty good about that, but it's been 6 months... 1-foot distance is closer than recommended; Error-1 means the projectile is not being "seen" by the first sensor: the trajectory might have been too high, or too low. Use a tape measure (vertically from the sensors) ensuring the distances are exactly correct, (4-inches) and that the diffusers (sun) are properly installed, or not (clouds.) You might even try borrowing someone's pellet rifle: it's cheaper, slower, has little muzzle blast, and can be "dialed-in" more carefully from only 3-feet... Sorry to hear of yours.... Mine worked perfectly! ... Good luck!
The manufacturer says it can be used for testing arrow velocity.
The top shelf is removable and has a bunch of small compartments for earrings. And a couple larger compartments for bracelets and necklaces. The bottom portion of it has two or three large compartments for larger jewelry. I bought mine two years ago and still use it daily. It is a great value and actually looks nicer in person than shown above! Great value :) you won't be disappointed
Bottom tray doesn't come out, only the top. There is one compartment on the bottom tray that should fit a folded letter sized document. I tried and it fit.
There is not a mirror.
Do not know, sorry.
It's two levels inside, top tray is small compartments. Bottom are larger.
It is roughly 7" front to back and about 11" long. It is a nice size unless you have alot of jewelry
without measuring-it's about 11" wide, about 7" deep (front to back). It's a very nice size jewelry box, very nice quality.
The largest is 12 x 10 x 1.75 inches; the smaller two fit side by side on top of the largest chest. I really like mine because they are not very deep, so they are better for finding fine jewelry, especially rings, earrings, and other smaller pieces. I still use a larger separate chest for wide bracelets and "statement necklaces." I hope this helps.
The silver jewelry kept inside does tarnish.
All are 9 inches deep and 1.5 inches in height. Widths are 11.5, 6.75 and 4.5 inches.
There is a loop that goes on your duty belt. For cuff securing, there is a molded indentation in the case that prevents them from coming out. I have had two of these cases on my duty belt and been involved in multiple foot pursuits through difficult terrain to include canals, wooded areas, open fields, as well as urban areas and have never had a set of cuffs come out. Like any new equipment, they require some practice to ensure that muscle memory takes over in high stress situations. I am very satisfied with this system.
i would not buy it. it did not fit my handcuffs
I bought two and on one of the cases I'm using my peerless 801 handcuffs. They fit perfectly. To answer your question, it should fit without a problem. The only real difference between the 801 and 701c model is that 801 has the hinges on the 701c has the chain link. The chain should not effect the cuffs from fitting in this case. They are about the same in size so that's why I don't see a reason for you to have an issue. I'm using my ASP cuffs on the second case and they are a little bit wider and thicker than the peerless even though their lighter. I still managed to make them fit on this case whoever. That is why I would feel safe for you to purchase this case for your 701c model. Hope this helps you.
Yep, nylon. Sturdy stuff. If you're not worried about looking pretty with leather gear, this stuff will get the job done.
Yes they will
No
I honestly dont know here is a link to their website http://www.bianchi-intl.com/ ask them directly. I have Smith & Wesson chain cuffs
No. It is just a case for the duty belt. No cuffs or keys.
6 1/2 x 3 x 3........they do a great job of holding my shaded over glasses for day & night trike riding.
Not sure about individual model of glasses that would fit... but as long as they are not goggle type glasses I would think they should fit... I use this case for three different styles of glasses the largest which looks similar to the fancy Harley Sun glasses... unless they are way above what you would see as normal sized glasses, they should fit with no problem... it's a pretty sturdy case too... good for in the saddle bag protection... hope this helps...
6 1/2 long 2 1/2 deep 3 1/2 wide
I don't know how long but it fit the neck well on my wife and still had some movement
yes...you can get this set in Ivory....thank you
like me I have a small wrist also Do not worry, I can do for you small size bracelet Thank you
yes .. You can now get the amount that you want Thank you
Not to counter the other answer, but I normally wear a size 34 waist, and regularly buy prAna pants in medium. I could not for the life of me fit comfortably in any of the mediums that I tried for the Sutra at a local store, mainly due to the facts that they aren't stretchy (the 3% lycra doesn't help at all) and don't have a fly. I now have a pair in large and they fit just fine. I would suggest checking them out at a local shop even though length isn't indicated on the labels and you might just have to re-hem them yourself.
Mine is 30,32. Just right.
I don't know the lululemon pants, but these are like light pajama pants.
The pants themselves are sized in length and inseam, not small, medium, large. I don't know why those are the options available through Amazon. I know the medium is 32x32.
Mine haven't, only washed them a couple times, cold water, only put them in a dryer for a few minutes. They hang dry really quickly.
I don't know for certain. It if they are truly Sutra pants, I have 3 pair and they are hemp poly and spandex
Inseam is the inner measurement of the pants length. That is from your private parts to the ankle.
2" ea
You could remove it, but it's not meant to be removed
It not possible to messure it, but I can tell you its strong enough to carry books parers etc. Is fullm aluminium. good luck
slide knob to the left sert numers release do the same for both sides
If you already tried opening it with the default combo 000-000, and it still refuses to open, then you'll have to try to remember any possible # of combo(s) you may have set it to. Can you think of a familiar number you may have used to set the lock(s) and start from there by trying every combo possible with that familiar number?
The laptop will move around a lot because of the depth of the case and the inside isnt very padded. You can probably get a fitted case for the laptop and then drop it into the case with your other documents and necessities.
Thank you for your inquiry. Unfortunately, we do not offer international shipping from our Amazon.com store.
17 1/8" across, 12 3/8" front to back, 3 1/4" depth minus the interior pockets
Inside the briefcase is the places to put pens/receipt books and other items you carry to conduct business, in my opinion you could put a laptop in this to keep it safe, is that what you are asking?
No
No. Never use a "stone" in one of these, as a rule of thumb. It'll make the pearl disintegrate.
No it does not use heat, just ultrasonic frequencies that loosen up dirt. I recommend using warm water, though, to make it even more effective.
6" long; 3 1/2" wide and 1 1/2 " deep
The instructions say to drain and wipe it down after using.
It's for watch bands so the face doesn't get wet.You hang the watch from it so the band is ssubmerged in the water.
I clean my weekly & they come put great. Don't use too much water, just enough to cover the item & they really sparkle!
Yes
Hello Ma'am, Thanks for asking. The white playable object that you saw inside the Ultra-Sonic cleaning device, is to keep jewelry or a watch On top of it so, the watch body is not immersed in the liquid. On some occasions, if the body of the watch is immersed in the liquid the parts inside the watch may become detached, due to Ultra-Sonic sound waves. So be careful there. But the watch metal straps can be cleaned by this device. Once again, the white playable bridge like object you see inside the Sonic device Is only a stand to place jewelry. Cheers. Sincerely Kumar
I put my Raymond Veil watch that I have owned for 15 years in the unit and went through the normal 3 minutes of pulsation. I did not have any problems. Yes it was a risk as the watch is very expensive but it worked out just fine and the watch looked great after I cleaned it. Raymond Veil is water proof for normal fall in the pool 10-15 feet so your watch should be fine.
I have put my diamond earrings in and they look great and have done fine. However, I don't know about sapphire.
32 liters
I'd recommend something smaller than 3l I find that it takes up alot of space.
It's a maxpedition product with the model name of Condor.
I have no idea. The main compartment maybe large enough. I use mine for hiking. It along with all Maxpedition products are very well made.
Mine doesn't have non slip material, the shoulder straps are padded and sewn in place. I absolutely love mine, I carry it in my trk. Constantly ready to go. I love to take it and go on a "day" trek to practice my woods skills.
Its taken me almost a year to break mine in. It wears like iron.
Yes the pack was for my son and it can carry a lot. He uses it for school , books, laptop& his hoodie/sweater all can fit inside. I guess it will depend on the size or thickness of the jacket
The bag will fit comfortly, I am 6'3" and for a medium size bag fits well. Will fit a 15 inch laptops.
I purchased this backpack for my son, he uses it for all his outdoor adventures (camping, hunting, etc) and also for school. I am not familiar with the backpack that you have but I can tell you that his backpack is 1400 cu.in / 23L. If you are looking for something bigger, Maxpedition has the Vulture-II 3-day backpack which has 2100 cu.in / 34L
Pretty much the full amount.
I think that would be a beautiful way to display a Christening gown. I used it as a centerpiece at my SIL's baby shower. I put a tutu and headband looped around the top. It is a shade over 2ft tall. My SIL now uses it to hold my niece's hair bows...until she takes it for herself ;) she loved it! Hope this helps!
this is pretty light weight...it's for indoors on a table if possible...I hope that helps...
ships same day as order.. if here before Noon.. as federal express picks up daily at noon.. if it left tomorrow.. should be there in 5 business days.. coming from CA.. d
No. This dress form is only about 2' tall.
I made the mistake of thinking it was a full size as well - when it arrived I realized that it isn't. It was beautiful but meant to be on a vanity or a shelf. I ended up ordering a different, full size one, which was also beautiful.
Total Height is 29" so centerpiece on table would need to by your call. Yes.. the base does come off. Dress portion is about 20" in height.
it only holds doll clothes, its that small
I used this for an assisted living facility. It seems sturdy enough for use at a vendor show for display. I used it as a decorative accessory at my facility. C. Walker
I don't think it's enough.. It's only 29 inches total height.
D-6", H-12", W-12". 3 pockets- 7"x3"X appx.1". One lg pocket 9x7". Handle drop Appx. 7"
Made in Tiawan.
Cannot answer as I purchased the garden tote as a gift. Will say, however, that my sister loved it. Have to purchase one for myself.
Gave this as a gift, so I don't know the dimensions. Has three outside pockets on one side, one large one on opposite side; no inside pockets. Recipient loves the bag, especially the cord to hold tools in pockets.
I measured the loop - 2 1/8 inches.
No, they do not. They do have a 3-4 inches of elastic material on each hip to allow for concealed carry with an IWB. That feature is great.
You would have to know your waist size and length size. They do not come in small/short like Propper's regular BDU's
They seem to be what they are advertised to be. They are well made and worth every penny I paid for them!!!
They are fitted in the leg. i do not think you could get knee pads under the pant leg.
8 pockets. No zippers except fly. All velcro
These run a little big and have a good amount of give, but to be safe...I would.
I am a 34 and because of what I carry I ordered a 35 and I think that you should allow a little give room because no ones waist stays the same for as long as these pants will last.
I have a pair. They are poly-cotton, but they feel like and have the weight of canvas.
Yes they do come with a belt
Small - no, Medium -would be fine. Large - if you want room to wear long underwear under it, or room to grow into it. Get the "long" sleeves.
I'm 5'3 185 and ordered the large short and it fits great. So depending on his size the short lenght should be fine
I'm about 5'8. I bought the medium regular and I personally think it fits well.
I'm the same height and that's what I got. Fits the arms better.

To get past the "horribly wrinkled" stage, soak in water, wring or blot and then hang it up. Most irons have a low setting that works well for the finishing touches. When on vacation, I am usually satisfied with rinse-and-wear.
Long enough for me and I am 6'2'
Not sure. I did not buy the shirt with spf in mind. If this is not specified on the amazon product description try the Exoffficio website. This is one of my favorite and most worn shirts.
No, it does not. Everything is in plastic bags. You have to supply the box.
The box says it is made in China, not sure who the manufacturer is. For adults only.
It takes 1-2 days inhouse, then shipping time.
Does not say on box. Assume some sort of surgical steel. Mostly nickel free as I did not have difficulty wearing pieces for several hours and have significant reactions generally.
I bought this, i loved it. It was easy enough with everything i needed. I made birthday presents for my family. I still have some left over that i can add to. Its a great price for all you get!
I purchased this as a present for my granddaughter, so I can't answer because I have no idea. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
No, but it is very well made. My wife loved it.
Nope. I actually have one and i store it in another deeper type box. no big deal for me though. I still love my Rita Jewelry Box.
yes, absolutely. on both sides.. the sides open up and there are hooks.. i love it
The lock is for the lid, which only covers the top section. The sides and drawers open freely. But it's not like it's really secure, regardless. Would only stop a child from gaining access. It is a pretty nice jewelry box, though.
i am 42 waist and it had plenty of room to expand.
The pouch is basically flat but may expand to 1" deep when filled. The hight is 5" and the width is 11". It actually looks bigger in the photo but the text dimension is wrong. I hope this answers your question.
I wouldn't buy it if you have arthritis. The plastic buckle is 1 inch wide and 1/2 inch long and is not for heavy duty use. May easily break. I ended up putting mine in my backpack when going through the TSA checkpoint at the airport. If I use it again, I'll probably put it in my backpack again.
Yes, a U.S. passport fits (max width) so as long as your phone is no larger it will fit. The money belt isn't the greatest, it tends to bunch up, but it is the best we have found so far.
Yes it does. There are 2 zippered compartments but I wouldn't wear it under my clothes when going through TSA checkpoint at the airport. They would ask you to remove it and run it through the x-ray machine. I put mine inside my backpack before going through the checkpoint.
There is a plastic mini buckle. One side fits into the other - fairly easy. Possible you have a defective item with missing or damaged. I wear mine around my waist underneath my shirt so that it can't be seen.
choose expedited shipping which takes from 1 -3 business days.
I don't know. It depends on how heavy set she is. It fits my husband who has a 40 Inch waist. It has an elastic band for the belt part of it. It is of good quality and looks like it will serve us well when we take our trip starting next weekend.
It is 10 1/2" wide by 5" high. It has two separate partitions so you can keep your passport in one area and money in another. I was very happy with it.
Yes, a foam Mastersword would fit just right in this belt. My family and I went to Comic Con as the Four Swords Adventures Links. We got the Foam LARP Sword and Shield set and found that the swords were too long to draw and shealth while wearing the belt, however, we could feed the sword through the loops of the belt for eachother. The swords fit just right without scratching off any of the paint. We even used the straps of the shield to clip it to the belt and sword on our backs.This freed our hands to shop and take pictures. I can't recommend this belt enough!
This item does not come with a sword, it's only the belt. Don't worry though, the sword in the picture is available on this site too!
I believe the master sword I purchased is the skinnier one. It rests perfect across the back. This is the sword I brought, http://www.amazon.com/Anime-Twilight-Princess-Master-Scabbard/dp/B001C02EZ6/ref=pd_sim_sg_5
Nope. Sold separately.
If you are purshasing the same I bought, it goes on your back from side to oposite side, just like Link holds it in Ocarina of time if you google pictures of link Ocarina of Time you can see how it holds. Hope this Helps. Regards. Regards, RPineda
unfortunately, I do not. but I purchased a wooden replica Master Sword from Twiggy's Treasures, and it fits like a glove.
Correct, especially when the sword is strapped in.
it should, it may not be a perfect fit but it should hold it in place.
the sword fits nicely into the loops and looks good together. my 10 yr old son was very happy with the setup. the only issue we had was a poorly glued handle on the sword which i took care of with some good ol' wood glue and a proper amount of drying time. hope this is helpful.
It's only the belt, no scabbard included.
Sorry, it does not play any music~
There must be a way to lock it, I don't really remember cuz this was a birthday gift for my friend. But what I feel is this box is quite heavy though it's very tiny! So I won't choose it to contain pills in my purse, cuz I have already carrying lot of stuffs in my bag. Just a advise! Hope it's useful for u! Thank you for asking me!
It's 1 3/4 by 3 inches inside measurement
No, it does not snap shut. But it is beautiful!
I gave this as a gift so I dont have it on me to measure it, but it seemed like the widest part of the oval it was 3 and a half inches. The more narrow part of the oval is maybe about 2 inches. The box is about an inch and a half deep, measuring about 2 inches if you include the lid.
Its about 3 1/2 inches
yes it will
It has a smooth inner rectangle on the top.
Hi Kim. The inside is a navy blue suede-like material. Firm suede, not plush but nice.
Yes, it is mirrored on the top and around the sides. It's Beautiful! Has a lock and key with it. Very happy with this jewelry box. &#128522;
The one we received a few months ago is just like the picture on the question: smooth top surface, but engraved (or at least engraved-like) border.
The outside is not glass, but the surface is perfect for engraving. Bought this as a gift for someone and loved it so much that I plan to get one for myself!
I bought one for my daughter last year. Yes it is sterling. It tarnished quite easily. It has a decent weight to it . Interior is blue velvet and has a mirror. Hope this helps.
Yes,I just checked using a 10$ bill and it fits with room to spare. Hope this helps.
The inside of the box measures 1-1/2" high. The largest compartment is 3-7/8" across by 3-5/8" front to back. The total width is 6-1/2". There are two smaller compartments., one of which is for rings.
I believe you can, i would take it somewhere like Things remembered or any place that does it, they would be able to tell you there for sure if it can be engraved. Hope this helps!
Yes
It is not a music box. As per the description, it is velvet/suede-lined box; good for jewelry or the like. No music.
Silver plated. It is quite small but very pretty to use as a gift box which I plan to do for my daughter or perhaps granddaughter because she wouldn't care it was silver plated.
The box is very small on the inside and can hold maybe two rings
4 (long)x2.5 tall(at it's tallest peak)x 2.5 (wide), which is about .5 friggin too short from what I needed!
standard American of 120 Volt
Yes, you remove the tub so you can rinse out the bowl and use again.....you would be surprise what comes out from your jewelry....amazing.
Yes, there is a white, plastic basket that you can lift out to remove the jewelry.
I usually use plain water to clean my jewelry. I haven't tried dish detergent,
I asked my daughter-in-law, whom I gave this jewelry cleaner to at Christmas. She says YES, and removes any tarnish and beautifully cleans her lovely white gold and diamond wedding ring. So yes it does clean silver!
Jewelers tell us not to put "stones" in the cleaner .
I think it is a great for home and travel use but it would be difficult to compare it to the steam cleaner our jeweler uses.
I know it cleans sliver and gold. It will clean any metal, you just have to check which cleaning solution you use. I love mine! Great investment.
I believe they sell both kinds, 220V and 110V. You will have to be specific and contact the seller to ensure you are shipped the 220V version.
Inside measurement is 61/4 long 5 wide 21/4 deep hope this help wife really love this cleaner would buy again..
On the 1.2 quart unit the wattage is stated at 60 watts. This is the rated electrical consumption, however I have no way to tell if the wattage of the transducers is different (less) or how many of them are in the unit. The unit I believe has the ability to warm so that wattage listed may be less. I have no information on the 1.6 qt unit.
At this time we do not ship to Australia.
Sorry we have even used it yet.
I bought this as a gift. It has not rusted but then is doesn't ever get wet.
I have never had an issue with the paint--mine is even. The only part that appears painted is the blackish background behind the lion, and the whole piece has a sort of antique finish to it. I've had mine for more than 4 years and have had no issues with regular wear. Hope this helps!
Go to www.entertainmentjewelry.com, the Official Summit Entertainment Twilight Jewelry Collection. The are pricey, but the items are in sterling silver, 14K gold, diamonds, white topaz, onyx, and black diamonds. If you are a huge fan and want something a little better made, try them out.
It fits like a chocker almost on me
The necklace is a steel alloy.
It would be a lot more if real silver, this is costume jewelry.
One place on amazon has it listed at 19.99 and one has it listed for $89. The item numbers and all the details are the same. Am I missing something?
Well, I ordered mine on the 12th and got them on the 15th but this was before they were on backorder. Now it says it'll be available on the 26th :( They are selling these at Hot Topic for $19.99 right now.
no i believe it comes on a card.
Hi I sell this necklace on amazon under zinnia_blue. It is more money than what amazon is selling it for but I have it in hand and I will ship international. My necklace also comes with a black fabric covered handmade gift box. It has a red satin liner. I can ship it priority international (6-10 days) at no extra charge. If you decided to purchase it pick the shipping international at check out. Thanks Erika
I suppose it would depend on your shoes. I adore the yellow! It's a real conversation starter & besides, if you're gonna go poultry might as well go all the way. You won't be disappointed.
No, it will not be free shipping to Sweden, the shipping cost will be calculated once items are added to your cart. Standard International shipping is 4-6 weeks. Thank you - Toynk
i have only used a mild soap face soap and water to clean it.
Shipping is automatically combined when the items are added to your cart. Just need to place the order for 2 and they will ship together. Thank you - Toynk
It's now available on Amazon UK
This item is shipped by Amazon and they have restrictions as to where they will ship.
Rubber/latex, it is exactly like if you bought one of those rubber chickens they use in stereotypical comedy shows.
It would probably hold them but the zippered opening is somewhat small.
They are a medium. She is wearing a 13 now and they fit her a little big, but not much. I hope that helps. Sorry I didn't respond sooner. My son drowned in the Kern River so my brains have not been with me for a while and I haven't been to amazon for a long time.
They run big, my grand daughter was a size 12 when we purchased for halloween.......they still flip off her feet!
Child's red sequin shoes (medium) is approx. child's size 8.
I actually never received these shoes in the mail and received a full refund. Sorry!
I don't think so. 5t would be the max upper limit. It is closer to a 3T.
I got this for a 2 yr. old. Fits size 2T to about a 4.
Yes, I think so. Our granddaughter is 4 but average size and there was room for growth. Everything stretches and has velcro closures so I think it will work for you.
I think it will.
I bought them for my 3 YO Granddaughter, who is tall for her age. They fit her and will go up to about a girl's Size 6
I think it will be too small. My girls are 3T and 5T and certain pieces fit each girl almost perfectly.
Best guess: these fit between a 4 and 6, but I think I mentioned in my review -- these need to be worn with clothing underneath. None of them close all the way or cover any important parts on their own! I can't double-check, as we donated them very soon after we received them.
Small 2t-3t. The treasure chest is basically cardboard and broke within a week. Not what I expected, but I suppose I got what I paid for:(
3\4
No. Thanks
Just don't wind it
I am not positive, but I would think so. The heart on the front is flat, so I would think you might be able to, but not sure. Sorry.
I sent it back right away because the ballerina didn't work, don't know if we overwound it,
Actually, I returned the item due to the faulty ballerina mechanism. I had read this on other reviews, but took my chances when I ordered it. Every time the box is closed, then re-opened, the cheap rubber ballerina bends and will not stand up straight. If you play with it, you can get it back into an upright position, but this process starts over every time it is re-opened. I was worried that it would eventually break off. The metal was a very shiny material but not sure what is what made of or if it would rust.
Yes the ballerina does spin! :)
Yes, it closes fine.
It plays for about four minutes. Yes, it stops when you close the lid. However, it plays very fast at first, then slows considerably. Other music boxes pace the music.
Metal on the outside. Under the metal I'm not sure. Could be particle board or wood. It's ways to sturdy to be cardboard. Sorry I couldn't tell you for sure.
We do not personalize this item, but it can be personalized.
It does come included with your purchase. I have the CCJAK01 it comes with the smoke grey lens, gloss black frame, I have the CCJAK06 it comes with the polarized Emerald Mirror(Amber) lens with gloss black frame. I also have the CCJAK03 it comes with the clear lens and the gloss black frame.
No these glasses do not do that.
It comes with a small case. It's not a hard case, but a stiff flexible zippered case. It looks similar to http://www.amazon.com/Como-Reading-Glasses-Sunglasses-Carabiner/dp/B008IBLBJM
Mine were crappy and scratched when I got them but the seller gave them to me for free after I complained
I wore these masks with my other (adult) friends. You'll want to get some ribbon to use instead of the elastic string (which will pull out through the holes too easily). Knot a piece of ribbon to each side and you can fasten with a bow in the back of your head, or under a ponytail, etc. They were super fun and everyone loved that adults were wearing kids' masks.
Yes, they do. At least when I ordered them last spring they did. We used them in our Seussical production
They are prepackaged and come as sets of 12 assorted Thanks
The masks look almost exactly like the picture. They cover roughly half of your face.
My Rolex, Tag, Luminox and my Seiko Diver watch all fit. Having no idea how large the band is on your husbands watch I can only tell you that the holder for the band is one inch wide and anything over that is not going to work. On the other hand, the unit is a very good investment...especially at the price!
Yes it will. I have a Rolex Milgauss and it fits perfect.
Yes, I use it but have to take off the outer layer.
Hi Vincent. The included AC adapter is designed for 120v outlets.
You need to buy your own batteries.
The winder in this case will handle one or two 40+mm watches. I have a 45.5 mm Omega Seamaster and a 48 mm Emporium Armani. They both fit well.
8" high in the back, 9 1/2 " long and 7" wide
I have never used a battery; it has been plugged in since I got it about 5 months ago and it has always worked for me.
It's very dark black with a glossy finish. I would describe it as a "piano back" finish
3V
I think they run true to size. I typically wear 9.5 and I ordered 10 because my feet grew recently. Most 10s are slightly large on me, and these were slightly large. So I'd guess true to size. Keep in mind that being rubber boots, they are tough to get on and off, so I like the extra room.
They are stamped Made in the USA on the bottom of my Sloggers.
orangy red
I wear 7.5 Wide, and size 9 fits.
They are only very lightly lined - if the weather is chilly, a thicker sock should suffice.
They are made of thick rubber, so yes. They will definitely keep your feet dry. But there is no lining in them. You'll need to add a liner or thick socks. I'd guess that if you won't be outside for very long that that would make a decent snow boot if you add liners and/or thick socks. If you are going to be outside for a longer period of time or live in extremely cold climates, then this is probably not the best choice for you.
Yes. Very Orange-ish.
There is no incisor, sorry.
I love the boots but haven't worn them yet...to answer the question I am 5'5" and come almost halfway between knee and foot..from the bottom of the sole to top of the boot it's 10"....no one can go wrong in buying the boots.. I can't wait until winter rain and snow
I would say No. They are perfect for gardening and a spring rain but they do not go up past your calf- so depending on how deep is deep - I would go for a pair that were a bit taller and closer to your knees. They are definitely not riding boots.

I bought an 8 which is my shoe size and I have a wide foot. I would probably say try an 8 1/2 to start.
Mine have some black lines and tiny blue flowers with other shapes in aqua and yellow. The above picture is not the boot I bought.
The upper part of the boot is not lined. The lower part of the boot with the comfort sole, it makes it feel lined. It is a comfortable rainboot. I am very happy with Sloggers and with my purchase. My daughter has a pair of rain boots, not certain the brand name, the foot does not have the comfort sole which makes it uncomfortable to wear.
I would say a couple pounds. Not too much.
Sure, but your feet would get very cold. These are rubber rain boots and not lined.
No
Yes. My experience is that they run small, so order up a whole size at least.
Shouldnt be easy to pack. The material is kinda thick. I did not think the boots were heavy when i wore them.

These are below the calf. The circumference of the top is 14 inches.
I wear a size 9 1/2 (medium width) and ordered a size 10 in the boots, and wearing a pair of socks with them, they fit well. I believe somewhere in the description of the product it suggested sizing up, if you wear a half size, since they only make whole sizes in this boot.
Yes. The sole of the boot has a nice tread on it. These are really nicely made boots.
i wear a B width (medium) and these boots are very comfortable.
The boots fit tight & I would not suggest for wide foot.
My size 7 boot is 10" tall.
I found them pretty comfortable. I wore them all day once and they felt good. the boot seems to have some padding to cushion your feet. Word of warning, since they are plastic, the top of the boot can rub against your leg. So I would recommend wearing a legging or pants inside the boot.
These are pull on boots. They come up above the ankle, but below the calf. The material is thick but flexible. The tread is quite good for sloppy days. The print looks a lot better in person.
I wear them everywhere! I do drive in them and they are both flexible and sensitive to the feel of the pedal of the car. I walk my dog in them through the rainforest in Hawaii for the most part, but think they are pretty easy to wear anytime....and cute, too!
I recently ordered a pair of Sloggers. Love them. Nice to get what you expected on an order

i have implants in both feet.. i got size 7 although i am a 6.5-7 depending on the maker and the style of the shoe. i slip them on bare foot just to take my two yorkies out in the morning because the grass is wet, and they slip right on with no problem.If you choose to wear socks, they should be thin knee socks or regular nylons, unless you have no calves or they are very slim. I find that they are very comfortable, are washable and i have a wide calf.These reach mid-calf and come with a very comfortable insole that you can remove and replace with another one of your choice.I have 3 of these boots in different patterns and color and recently purchased them in solid black and they are beautiful and very well made with tabs on the side to help ease them on as well as on the back of each heel to ease them off.This is made IN AMERICA not CHINA.I do suggest that you contact the Sloggers Company and have them give you the measurements around the instep and calf, then take your own measurement, at least you will know if they will fit you before you order. They look great with skinny jeans by the way and are TOTALLY water proof and are washing machine safe.... how about that!!! Hope you're able to get them.!!
I typically wear size 9 medium shoe. my toe touches to the end of the boot. I can wear a sock just fine though. Is a true 9 I would say. I would think if you sometimes wear a 9.5 shoe you should buy a 10. Dont think it should be too terribly big. A tough call for sure. I do like the boots. Had some heavier type muck boots that were sloppy big same size. These are tighter and feel more stable. Hope that makes sense.
one boot weighs 1lb 2oz.
Mid calf. I love these boots!
I have this print in gardening shoes, they have a black background it looked navy on the website also. I have the boots in black patent, I wear a 9 or 9.5, I got the 9 in both and just right. I can wear socks, not heavy ones, and the boots are very comfy. Good luck, and Happy Holiday.
They are great..The arch is nice..and your feet don't swim in them. They are very cute, as well
No they are basically a rubber boot I bought them for yard work and wear a heavy sock works great for me
bigger than most but not as big as i expected. this is a high quality boot with great insoles and a good bottom. this is not like the low quality boots that you buy at the hardware or department stores.
Hi Victoria, I'm not sure what the circumference is. I usually take a size 9 and these are true to size, but they just fit. No wiggle room for a heavy wool sock. The height is about 12" from floor. I received the wrong color but I kept them because the dark floral was fine with me and they are super comfy! Hope this helps.
They keep your feet dry but they are rain boots, so they won't keep them too warm! Still awesome boots though :)
I haven't ran into that problem. The shoe fits my foot perfectly. I normally wear a 7 1/2 shoe and that equals a 37 but maybe my foot is wider so I need a 38.
I cannot say for sure, as I only bought these. I did use a few objects (e.g., a lipstick tube) to stretch out the small toes. That's where they were the most pinchy on me (4th, 5th toes). I am pretty close to a 6.5 on most things. On some I've done 7. On ski boots I had a 6 and I did smaller on climbing shoes that were really meant to be snug. I thought I googled at one point on sizing and got a comparison of the various styles, like kmd and sprint. If you're at all concerned, wouldn't the one size up be less likely to pinch and you could get those sox with the toes?
Not sure. We don't have such terrains in my country.
I guess if you sprayed Scotch Guard on it, it could be waterproofed but on it's own, it's not.
No there is no compartment. However odor does not seam to be a problem. I have mine on a timer so it is off all day.Comes on when i get home from work and stays on all night. In the morning my work boots are always dry.Then it turns off. Good luck
My son is 11 years old and wears a size 6.5 and my daughter is 6 and wears a size 2. I can fit their shoes on the PEET Dryer. His shoes are mainly cleats and tennis shoes, but it works for my daughter's Ugg boots as well.
It will dry them nicely and you don't need to purchase an extension. The tube is about 20 inches tall from the top of the base.
I have my PEET plugged into a Kill-A-Watt meter, with my rates, leaving my dryer plugged in for months, my daily cost is $.09, monthly cost is $2.80.
No its rated for 120 volts
Yes
I would say its about 5 feet long. Longer than I would expect.
i leave my boots on all night (10 - 12 hours), but boxing gloves should not take quite that long. i would think 4-5 hours should be enough to dry them out.
SURE
Try putting a pair of shoes on it for an hour or so, they should warm up. You should not hear any noise as it is just a heating element that causes a natural thermal draft.
There isn't a specific laptop compartment, so if you put a laptop inside it would get jostled around, unless you put it in some sort of padded sleeve. But, there is a good amount of space in this briefcase; inside dimensions are 16.5 x 11.5 x 3.5 (inches).
Don't do it..Its crap! The day after I started using it the seams on the back side separated and nothing I do fixes the problem. Hardware on my brown case is silver.
Yes
If you look behind the combination locking mechanism area there are two leather round that you lift up under them there will be two metal prong in which you push towards the side and hold while you set the numerical sequence once number choice is set place prong back in position and close briefe case latch and latch without moving dial but as well prior to closing briefe case toggle latches in lock unlock mode open with out touching dial now close case lock and unlock if this works you are all set
I bought this item with Xbox 360 and was shipped with Xbox 360. I cannot tell you the exact dimensions because this was in November, however, I can tell you that the shipping box was big enough to fit this item and Xbox 360, and still had wiggle rooms to put stuffing in the box.
They are only available in brown and black
Obviously at that price it is not genuine leather, but it looks like it.
case has to be flat (its a safety). Then push tabs outward.
Here's a little more info to help you make a decision. My husband is the same sleeve but a 15, sometimes 15 1/2 in the neck. I ordered him a medium in the short sleeve style for Christmas and it was really big. It was so big I almost returned it but since I picked it up cheap on a Lightning Deal I decided to keep it and trying washing it. It's polyester though, so it didn't really help. These shirts are standard wear in our neck of the woods (or should I say water?) ;-). They are not meant to be fitted but they shouldn't be too billowy either. The medium on my husband (who could stand to loose a few) definitely bordered on too billowy. They are very(very) wide and run big through the shoulders. The shoulder seam actually came down about and inch or two into his upper arm. For what its worth, I am going to try a small this time around and hope for a better fit.
The sleeves can be rolled up and secured with a button tab.
Tough question. Think a small might be to short.
I bought "vivid Blue" and it is true to color. Awesome shirt. Very light and comfortable!
A size Small fits neck 15-15.5, sleeves 33, and chest 35-38.
I don't know what to say but will tell you that I'm 6' usually wear a 16 1/2 by34. I bought a large and it was to big. If I had to do it again, would get a medium. Hope that helps.
No
I'm 5ft9in and weight 190 lbs and large fits fine for me. XL should do it. It may be long, but it's such a nice shirt, that shouldn't matter. Buy just one and see. I now have five and wear them almost every day! My wife gets credit for the answer, but it's really mine.
I think the size L maybe large for you. your shoulder and chest is like me. but the shirt is too long and the chest is too big
Absolutely correct. Go with small.

This is simply a metal alert badge on a chain. It does not connect with any other device or system. The idea is that in a medical emergency in which you cannot communicate with medical personnel, they will see the medallion and know you are taking Coumadin/Warfarin. For example, you might be unconscious after an auto accident. There is also a small card you can fill in and carry in your wallet with additional medical information. That's all there is to it.
No, the necklace does not tarnish
Roughly 1.25 inches long and .5 inch wide.
Hi, I'm sorry. No. Amazon does not allow custom orders on their site at this time. Sincerely, Don Rock Ridge
Yes
Yes they should. I have both models and the tubes are the same size.
You can put as much or as little in this but all 4 dryers will run. I sometimes use just 2 it all 4. It's a great purchase. I dry not only shoes but gloves etc.
It isn't a must that the Peet be unplugged after each use. The Mult Peet has four heating elements that combined use 72 watts (less than a 75 watt light bulb) of electricity and if that totals pennies a day in operation. It is acutally recommended to leave the Peet dryer plugged in all the time 24/7. There is no harm since the unit uses a very low level of heat (100 degrees) and is convectional heat which is safe.
It is large enough for an adult. The eye holes are hard to line up, but frankly, if you put the mask around and waive your arms around to avoid runninginto things, it kinda makes you look more like Godzilla. :)
Hi. You are expected to see through the mouth. It's somewhat narrow and I found impossible if you are doing something active with it like I was (I.e. paddling an SUP) My solution was to cut off the top 3/4 section of a bottle of water and insert it into the mouth of the GODZILLA mask to keep it open. Fred
Not from just wearing the mask and walking around, your biggest obstacle will be trying to see as the only eye-hole is in the mouth. I also can't speak to retaining consciousness if anyone decides to dawn the mask while destroying Tokyo, if they're not in shape - they could, possibly, pass out.
It might..its hot and vision and breathing are tough.
Yes, it could be used as a puppet, it's pretty well made
Green
No it does not but it looks great on.
It's in the log area.
That battery lasts long time. It is replaceable. CR 2032 battery. Use a coin to screw off the battery cover. I do not think I have replaced the battery in six months. The battery for the heart stap is the same. It does not last as long
Watch body is 1 7/8" wide. It is not as big and bulky as suunto or some iron man watches but it is still primarily a rather technical watch for a man's wrist.
Yes...
Skirt measures 23.5 inches exact, I measure 5.5 " and the skirt is right below the knees, I think that for you will be mid-calf, if you have twenty years perhaps this is very long, Think about this, on the other hand the skirt is very comfortable and practical.
My skirt didn't seem to shrink only getting back to its original shape.
There is no measurement chart as far as I could find, but read the feedbacks, which are helpful in regards to find the right size. I found that it runs large and wish I had bought one size smaller.
For sure...it runs a bit large. I love this brand. I have bought many pieces.
I just measured both my Discovery Skirts (Size 2) and they seemed to be around 30 and a half inches at the top. They don't actually sit on my waist but slide a bit below it. I have no experience with the Discovery Pants so I can't offer comparisons there. I would not normally wear a Size 2, so I think they run a bit big.
I would go with a 6 and perhaps a 4, depending on your waist and hip measurement. These run quite large. My size 8 is 23" long and sits below the waist.
Not at all. It's a great material. Quality product.
I would not. It is a very tight weave nylon blend with a sort of brushed microfiber feel, like hiking shorts. I held my khaki skirt up to the bright window and not enough light passes through to see my hand inside, even pressed tight against the fabric.

I wear a medium in these shorts, and I have a 32" waist. Very comfortable.
unlined inseam with 6". Size listing is unreliable. I ORDERED A SIZE XX LARGE WHICH i THOUGHT WOULD BE A 48" WAIST BUT WHEN I MEASURED THEY WERE A 40". BUMMER!!.
Is the length of the pants from the crotch measured on inseam of the pants/shorts, as opposed to the outseam which would run from the waist.
I just measured. The inseam is about 7-8 inches. I am 5'10", about 200 pounds, hung like a donkey and they fit just fine. I don't know where your question is coming from so I covered all bases.
Here is the waist size listings for the Men's Backcountry shorts from the Royal Robbins website: S = 30" M = 32" - 33" L = 34" - 36" XL = 38" - 40" XXL = 42" - 44" Could not find a length measurement on the website
Get the XXL. I wear a 40; got the XL.

Yes it is electric and it works very well. It is a slow process and takes over nite, but a great tool...
Favorably. They both do the job. I have three different versions: 1) Peet, 2) Cabela's (Peet), and 3) MaxxDry. Cosmetic differences and cord length other than that functionally similar and interchangeable tubes.
120V, 60HZ, 3KW2 is what it says on the bottom...good luck!
Yes
No noise its always silent...if you let it run a little with boots or shoes on it then take one off you can feel its warm inside!!!
It's only a 2 prong
I would think that if the gloves fit on the drying rods, it would work. This unit does not get overly hot. you might contact the manufacturer of your boxing gloves to make sure.
Yes
Yes
Yes
Good afternoon. Thank you for your interest in our products. Unfortunately this is the only color it comes in. Have a wonderful day.
Read their ad...measurements are stated in their specifications. I was not very happy with the quality of this jewelry box...thought it was poorly made.
It is true to size -10.2 inches x 5.5 inches x 11.4 inches. I should warn you that as pretty as it is - it is not a quality product and the screws started falling out a few weeks after I got it.
I'm not a good judge of the type of finish on the box but I would tell you that my box is closer to cherry than a mahogany finish.
We do stock the Oakley Straight Jacket Polarized Sunglasses. We currently have the red and black iridium lenses in stock in that model.
If you sleep alone yes. If you share a bed these MMA shorts tend to make you punch, kick, knee and elbow in your sleep.
Yes, it comes up almost half way on both sides.
Not positive, but a medium or large should work. The shorts are quite elastic so medium would probably be your best bet, if I had to guess. I'm 6 feet tall and 205 lbs and I use an xl and there's plenty of room for my 34 inch waist. Hope this helps, good luck
Nope
Go XL, they have a very stretchy waistband so don't worry about it being too tight. And you can just use the drawstring if its slightly too big

Insect Shield process binds a proprietary permethrin formula tightly to fabric fibers-resulting in effective, odorless insect protection that lasts the expected lifetime of apparel. Permethrin has been successfully used in the United States as an U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered product since 1977
We do have a few in size 7 available.
You can go to tillys web site they have a size chart and how to measure properly as they are supposed to fit slightly loose so you need to see what they want you to do
Brim- 2 1/4" on the side, 3 1/4" in front. I've packed the hat in a suitcase for a trip to Austria with no problem. CRUSHED into a backpack? Not sure about that.

As the designer of this unit I can assure you it will dry up to eight inch work boots with out extensions
Yes
Almost 15".
This boot/glove dryer puts a Peet dryer to shame, way better product by far, no comparison by any means! The name MaxxDry speaks for itself !!Eddie James, from Superior, WI
This unit runs only on 120v AC. Using the heat setting, it is rated to draw 230 watts. You could use it with an inverter rated at 750w or more, but I would recommend running engine to keep the battery charged. Without heat, at 70F it takes about 3 hours to dry my poly filled gloves. With heat, about 45 minutes.
The long boot extensions come off, but it doesn't easily disassemble beyond that. It is portable, and I've packed it in a large suitcase before for road trips but not when I've had to check a bag for a flight. If you are looking for something to take on a flight I'd recommend getting a smaller model. But this thing works great and will dry soaked boots, gloves, etc dry in a couple hours.
Yes
The base is 7" x 10" x 11" tall and doesn't break down any further. Hope this helps!
Absolutely! My husband dries out his leather boots on it, my kids have misc shoes (leather included) and it works awesome! We used it every day over the winter. I recommend this one.
It's electric. We've had ours for 3 years now - just as great.
If you took good care of them they will last a year or two. I've used them 20+ times and they are still in their purchased condition. They don't require any adhesive to stay. I wash them with a mild soap and just let them dry. The case they come with helps keep them protected.
I'm not a runner, but I had these on one day, ending up wearing them to zumba. Did just fine with the hour long workout. The bond between the nippie and me was intact and dry, even when breaking a sweat with the workout.
I believe they are meant to go right on the skin which is how i wear them and they work great that way, no shifting around at all. They work with the warmth of your skin. There is no padding, they are jelly like.
That's how I'm using them at this very moment. I'm out and about with my kids and am wearing a tight, thin cami under a fairly loose (mommy appropriate) tank top. No bra, just nippies. I got a breast augmentation 6 weeks ago and my headlights have been on full high beams ever since, but my nippies conceal it completely and stay in place really well under form fitting shirts. Haven't tried them with a loose shirt and no bra.
mine had an odor that disappeared in a few hours. try using some mild soap and water and air dry
It depends on the color of your bra, if it is padded, and the color of the shirt you will wear over it. When in doubt, get the color closest to your natural skin tone and you won't have to worry!
So far, I haven't found a material these don't work under. I haven't tried silk yet. But I suspect they will be perfect!
I'm just like you and it works for me, it covers them very nicely
Are you using them with a bathing suit? These are non adhesive so even excess sweat will make them fall off if your top isn't particularly tight etc. If you use them instead of swim padding I'm sure they'll be fine. But solo definitely not
We sell the Medium as well.If you put nippies skin covers medium in the "Search" you will find it :)
No, need shin guards
Yes they do. My kids like them. Our school orders these socks to go with the soccer team uniforms.
We have only purchased the white/red, white/royal, and each has the 3 stripes. Based on my experience, the photo and description is accurate.
Well sure, soccer players run in them all the time! If you are trying to use them as an inexpensive compression sock, no they wont work. They are snug but they do stretch too much. I wear a compression sleeve under these socks when I play soccer.
I found this on the earbags dot com website: Earbags come in three sizes. To find the size right for your ear, measure your ear from top to bottom. If your ears are: 2.25&#8243; long or smaller, size Small is appropriate. 2.25&#8243; to 2.75&#8243; long, size Medium is appropriate. 2.75&#8243; long and larger, size Large is appropriate.
They cup over your ears and clip around them. They don't go around your head at all, just your ears
Yes there are two ear bags a set. I really like mine so far.
Yes
I don't see why they couldn't be worn with a helmet since they are low profile. Just be careful when you remove your helmet. The very first time I wore my Earbags, the wind was blowing and one of them was blown right off my ear and was lost. I won't be purchasing them again because I thought it was a pretty high price for one wearing!
Well, I have somewhat small to medium ears. These fit my ears perfectly and they accommodate earrings when I wear them. However, if your ears are considered large, you may want to up the size.
I suggest the 180 ear mitts instead
I wear glasses too, so yes, they are comfortable with glasses. I sometimes wear a tortoiseshell headband and that is just too much, but glasses alone they work just fine.
I use them for pre- and post-season driving in my convertible. I've had no trouble with cold seeping in - including highway speeds in low 40 temps. Unsure if using them in true frigid weather would keep you warm enough - but then again, layering is always best.

Yes
Straps are 1" wide
It's just a strap. You can loop it around the handle(s) or just around the bag to compress and then click it closed. It has a plastic buckle type thing. Don't know what that type of buckle is called. It's pretty unsophisticated. I used it to compress my backpack.
One end is the buckle. The other end is cut off. You put the cut off end into the buckle properly for solid fastening, at any tightness you want. Kind of like a belt without holes in it. Once you get it to the length you need, you can snap it in or out and even tighten it further once it is snapped. If you are using the strap for only one purpose, you can sew the loose end so it won't budge at all. You can cut off excess at an angle and flame the end so it won't unravel.
Yes
This should work for you, though do know that the strap doesn't hold extremely tightly. It tends to give a little. The length is probably longer than what you need, though that can be fixed by cutting it to the length you want and then using a flame to singe the end of the strap. Its nylon so it will melt and not fray. I did this for mine and it worked fine.
Yes it will. Its actually much larger than 28". I will say though if you put a decent amount of weight on it, it will sag a little bit. And if you're only using 28" or so inches of it, you will need to cut it down and sure a flame to melt the end so you dont have a lot of excess strap.
if i had to guess...id say 12-15 inches on either side...(if memory serves me correct)
There are tabs inside behind the lock. It looks like a hole punch in the leather. When those are moved to set the combination, you can change it. Remember to move them back when you are done. I did have a little difficulty seeing them but a flashlight helped.
Yes as long as you don't set the combination
Unfortunately, the briefcase ripped in 2 places that were very noticeable. I returned it and took a chance with another case same as the first one and same exact rips occurred. I would not cut anything especially if you do like the briefcase. I have to say customer service was excellent and my case was way out of warranty time!
No. After setting both combinations, one side works perfect and the other side wont lock. So the lock on one side doesn't work.
It's on the right side
Yes it ships the same day as ordered from our PA. warehouse ( as long as you order before Noon) Thank you JLW Sales
No
~700
No
what the hell does that mean, outname on briefcase?
I am 5.8" and over weight. I bought the large. I think medium will be fine for your son.
I had to order 2 sizes bigger then what my clothes are. That way they would fit over my clothes
I wear a womens size 12/14 and the medium was plenty big. I can wear this over a hoodie or light jacket. Hope this helps
Yes the coat is not tight around your legs or waist. Walking is not a problem.
I bought mine XTRA large so I could fit a coat underneath. It is roomy and comfortable. As far as cutting it off, why would you want to. I chose this one because it was long and covered my knees. Didn't want water draining down my pants! If you want a shorter coat I'd find another style rather that cut this one.
Yes
I'm 5'4" And I weigh 195 lbs. I bought the size XXXL. That fits me fine.
We have to use 2 of them at once as per the rules of the place our daughter has swim lessons. They fit beneath her swimsuit fairly easily doubled, so 1 should be fine.
http://www.finisinc.com/kids/swim-diapers/swim-diaper-solid-2.html I had to look up the size chart on the Finis website.
I would get the 18-24 month size.
It's a pull-up diaper.
NO
I would go with a L for that size. The M was tight on my 18 month old.
It is 18-24 months.

It has been a while since I ordered it for a gift. I believe it did have a plastic adjustment tab in the back.
Yes it does. Still have mine. Very good product for the price
I bought this as a gift for a friend that flies planes. I believe that this type of hat was worn by tweedle dee and tweedle dum in Alice in Wonderland. Don't know if it really has a purpose other than fun
There is no way to specify medium or small, just make sure the hat is for kids or adults. It's more like one size fits all.
it is rectangle
Nylon strap and plastic buckle.
to attach a piece of glint tape. IR reflective material so you can be identified by a friendly from overhead.
Regular ball cap
It's 3 3/4" long & 1" wide
Hat made in China. Flag patch unknown
I believe it is adjustable.
It was my adult daughter that bought it! She saw in on a Price is Right contestant and Drew Carey asked 'where did you get that hat'. She gets compliments/comments on it a lot, even by a banker in a suit @ Wells Fargo!
The shipping cost is determined by the total cost of the order and where it is being shipped to. Thank you
It's a one size fits all hat. There's a velcro latch on the back.
The bill of the hat that 80sTs carries is flat.
Yes, it's stainless steel
Small record I would guess yes. A 33 size won't fit. Careful not to warm up te cleaning solution too much so it does not warp the vinyl
I believe it's 1/2" NPT.
Sent it back and got refunded. No questions asked. It was DOA. Very Disappointed. I figured if it arrived broken. it was a bad product and wouldn't last long if I got a working one.
basket dimensions are 8.5" W x 11" L x 5" D. not sure about the warranty. I have never seen the tank/unit heat up without using the heater. But, the heater itself is the on/off type, not PID, so it frequently overshoots set temperature.
100-120v 60 hz
The heating function did now work for us using mineral oil - it does not seem to flow well enough. We were hoping to use it to clean the wax off 3D printed parts. So now we use a crock-pot with mineral oil to clean the bulk of the wax and then soapy water in the ultrasonic cleaner to clean off the remaining residue.
Does this cleaner come with a basket?
yes, citric acid is best. I've used it to restore the parts for 3 bicycles. This included a rusty chain that most people might have thrown away. Unfortunately, I don't remember the concentration I used, but there are many online forums that talk about this very thing. I THINK it was 1 cup per gallon plain water. I did let my parts soak overnight, after about 20 minutes of ultrasonic. But, double check online. Citric acid is a very common processed food additive, and I bought mine from Amazon. it dissolves very quickly in water and does not leave staining on the metal like other acids might (vinegar, oxalic). Just be sure to rinse parts thoroughly when you're done.
It plays "All the Things You Are". I looked up the song and tune on amazon and played it to hear it. I think I've heard it before. I got the lyrics off the internet.
About 10 inches at most in height. Sits on my daughter in laws mantle. Very nice piece
My daughter in law loved the gift. I gave it to her for her birthday and she told me she keeps it in her bathroom and reads one each morning as she gets ready for work. They have been married several years and it was very appropriate.
Watch out, this are a cheap plastic imitation, no genuine hair strands ... Seller should be honest and specify the real poor quality of his product
Mine started to fray the first day I had it. I haven't worn it since, and, I wont ever order another one.
These are made from real Elephant hair. I own one and can guarantee you these are genuine. You can tell if it is genuine or not by burning the tip of the bracelet. Smells like burning human hair! People who ship these to the US have to have a license that proves these were collected without harming the Elephants. These can't be shipped to the US unless they are legally harvested. Amazon doesn't allow illegal products into the US. All things on Amazon are legal.
No
It has a usable depth of 2"
No it is more of a brown velour finish. Had looked at many and this one was by far the best quality. Fit, finish, and hardware are top notch.
No
It does have some us-used space on the door but I believe that is because it would be difficult to close the door if it was full of jewelry. I have had the piece for quite awhile. I love it. the wood is beautiful
It difficult to tell. I would say hardwood. It's very well constructed. It's too well constructed to be particle board, in my opinion. It already comes almost completely assembled, so that's why it's difficult to say.
16 9/16 inches
Hi, thanks for your question. I've checked the different options in this listing and unfortunately, the minimum time for this Mirror to be prepared for shipping is 1-2 days, and the shipping time is then 3-5 days. This means that the mirror could take up to 7 days to be delivered which would then miss the required delivery date. You can view the time it takes for the seller to ship the item if you check the listing, and you can view the shipping options by clicking on "Domestic shipping rates" below the seller's name. Sorry I don't have better news!
No. the back is a black board type material and you can see the screws and brackets that it is put together with. But the front is beautiful and good quality wood and well made
Just over 20" wide, and 3" depth. Wife loves it.
I looked at Under Armour's website and found the following information: Men's shoe sizes: Medium - 4 - 8.5 Large - 9 - 12.5 XL - 13 - 16 http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/pid1211106 The sizing chart the mentioned website. Hope this helps.
One pair. Kinda pricey, but they are good socks!
Yes! It goes right up to the knee.
No
The socks are a medium weight pair of socks. They are not thin like summer dress socks.
Only had them a couple of weeks. If you wear them with cowboy boots, you may need another pair of ankle socks as they are not as padded as i would like. When you slide your boots off and under whoever's bed, though, your feet will smell like feet. Do they smell like old cotton socks.....not at all. Do they block them odors?.....not sure anything be is blocking of them odors. If you stink, your feet will too. If a shower doesn't help with the whole odor thing, it may be your diet. These are tough and made for not being hot and they do the whole not being hot thing very well. They also stay up over the calf all day long--unless your legs are a bit birdy, i guess. They seem to be the same material as other UA socks i have had for years and still wear today. So, to answer your question, these things smell like candied bacon when you are in a candied bacon store, and like you when you are wearing them. Happy tall socks hunting and ordering and thankful stuff.
I would go off of the packaging from under armour. I didn't even look when my husbands socks came in
Yes
They have a cotton feel, but they are 85% Polyester, 3% Nylon and 2% Spandex, so no shrinkage in the dryer.
Yes, seamless toe. Just got back from London where I took several pair to help me navigate with my very sensitive feet. They were terrific: Well padded, not difficult to get on and off, good for circulation and prevented swelling. I'm not an athlete or a hiker. Just 80 years old and arthritic.

Only had them a couple of weeks. If you wear them with cowboy boots, you may need another pair of ankle socks as they are not as padded as i would like. When you slide your boots off and under whoever's bed, though, your feet will smell like feet. Do they smell like old cotton socks.....not at all. Do they block them odors?.....not sure anything be is blocking of them odors. If you stink, your feet will too. If a shower doesn't help with the whole odor thing, it may be your diet. These are tough and made for not being hot and they do the whole not being hot thing very well. They also stay up over the calf all day long--unless your legs are a bit birdy, i guess. They seem to be the same material as other UA socks i have had for years and still wear today. So, to answer your question, these things smell like candied bacon when you are in a candied bacon store, and like you when you are wearing them. Happy tall socks hunting and ordering and thankful stuff.
I would go off of the packaging from under armour. I didn't even look when my husbands socks came in
Yes
They have a cotton feel, but they are 85% Polyester, 3% Nylon and 2% Spandex, so no shrinkage in the dryer.
Yes, seamless toe. Just got back from London where I took several pair to help me navigate with my very sensitive feet. They were terrific: Well padded, not difficult to get on and off, good for circulation and prevented swelling. I'm not an athlete or a hiker. Just 80 years old and arthritic.
I looked at Under Armour's website and found the following information: Men's shoe sizes: Medium - 4 - 8.5 Large - 9 - 12.5 XL - 13 - 16 http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/pid1211106 The sizing chart the mentioned website. Hope this helps.
One pair. Kinda pricey, but they are good socks!
Yes! It goes right up to the knee.

I returned this bra, but all my other exofficio clothing is extremely easy to wash and fast drying.
There is no padding at all. Great to sleep in!
I am 34B and the medium is a great fit. You certainly would not need a large. I think I would go with a medium if I was you.
iwould order medium
I'm pregnant, in a 36 C nursing bra and the medium is a little lose but comfy.
A small might work; I'm a 32C and it was just slightly too big around the ribs but the cup part was okay.
its about 3/4 of an inch.
Yes
Inch each very small
the tops pop on, not screw and I am not sure they are food grade- that would be important if you are going to use them for lip gloss or such

Hi, These gem jars will hold the charms if the charms are smaller than the dimensions of the jars. Thank you! Caddy Bay Collection
Not having it directly in front of me I would say they are about 14 x 8 x 2, and the size of the cups are a little over an inch round. However, I have found that not all companies have the same dimensions in their construction. What you may run into if this is not a one time purchase; have to buy from another company later and their box may be bigger or smaller and then they will not stack evenly. If you can, and you think that you will need more than one in the future, buy more than just the one for later. This way in the event the company goes to another size or doesn't carry them anymore, you will have the same size; as long as you don't exceed your original amount.
Top is not threaded... Just a slip on grip cover!
Yes. Very easy to use and paid for itself on day one.
Hi, I suggest that you take closer look at the links screw whether is a tiny screw or split end that was being closed up which look like a screw slot. Or you treat as split pin, pick correct punching size tool and give a light hammer tap in the direct the link arrow showing to move the pin out. Hope this reply helps. Good luck!
Yes
The black and not very good, poor quality!!!!
Yes, you will. There is a tool in the kit to help with that.
Not sure I don't own a watch that big.
They give you an abundance of springs in case of assorted sizes. I'm certain the'll have the size your looking for.
No
No, this kit seems to be for a seasoned watch expert.
Yes they seem to be safe for all the jewelry. I do have to say that I am not that impressed with them. My silver still tarnish almost as fast as it did with out them. I would not buy them again. They were good for keeping earrings in pairs. Hope this helps you out.
Absolutely.
I have used for both gold and silver and all my jewelry is tarnish free. I feel they work well for both.
No. Pearls go into a soft jewelry bag alone. The only way to clean cultured pearls is wipe gently w a damp cloth after each time u wear them. Never put them in an air tight box such as safety deposit box. They will deteriorate. I'm a jeweler 35 years.
Yes
I do not see anything on the label that indicates what the bags are made out of since they are not used for food. Many food bags now state that they are BPA free but I am unaware of any concerns with pvc. You can contact the manufacturer at http://nancysilver.com. The label claims that this is the same technology used by NASA, The Guggenheim Museum and jewelry manufactures worldwide and they have worked for me!
Unless the jeweler's box has some tarnish resistant quality, I would store silver in the bags. I think they do a great job in preventing tarnish. I don't need to clean my silver very often with these bags.
It is hard to know since you don't give the measurements of the conch belt/buckle, but I found the inside of the bags true to measurements. As you would expect, the zip locking opening is a bit narrower to assure a tight grip when closed. Hope that helps.
Yes, the front of the bag is clear . The back is the copper color. It's helps to separate the different rings which is how I put my ring collections together . So I hope I answer your question .. Yes clear in front copper on back .

No. These pants attract zombies. I think it's something in the waterproofing material. Also, they SCREAM "I am well-prepared and have lots of supplies on hand." You need to be a little more subtle than that, or you'll attract attention. Also, the belt has a tendency to get wrapped around your neck and choke you out, which decreases chances of survival.
I now have 4 pair of these pants, and they all seem to fit the stated size in both waist and inseam. They have a dual waist closure - button on the fly plus a snap at the belt-line, and they come with an adjustable nylon web belt. I highly recommend these pants.
I have been wearing Propper Lightweight pants for five years and I would have told you no but I looked closer and they all do have a pocket for knee pads. I had to fold the pant leg back to find it. It always looked just like a reinforced knee but the pocket is there.
Yes they do
I wore the Propper lightweight men's pants when I was working in 30-90 degree (mountains) Fahrenheit weather. Ideally they are comfortable in the spring and fall (50-80 degree F). If you are going to wear them in constant cold weather (close to or below freezing) I would wear thermals underneath to provide protection from the elements.

No. These pants attract zombies. I think it's something in the waterproofing material. Also, they SCREAM "I am well-prepared and have lots of supplies on hand." You need to be a little more subtle than that, or you'll attract attention. Also, the belt has a tendency to get wrapped around your neck and choke you out, which decreases chances of survival.
I now have 4 pair of these pants, and they all seem to fit the stated size in both waist and inseam. They have a dual waist closure - button on the fly plus a snap at the belt-line, and they come with an adjustable nylon web belt. I highly recommend these pants.
I have been wearing Propper Lightweight pants for five years and I would have told you no but I looked closer and they all do have a pocket for knee pads. I had to fold the pant leg back to find it. It always looked just like a reinforced knee but the pocket is there.

I wore the Propper lightweight men's pants when I was working in 30-90 degree (mountains) Fahrenheit weather. Ideally they are comfortable in the spring and fall (50-80 degree F). If you are going to wear them in constant cold weather (close to or below freezing) I would wear thermals underneath to provide protection from the elements.

These portfolios are not too wide, and they are a little stiff , I would say about 4

It is selling one leather portfolio in Burgundy color. Thank you!
The interior is nylon and it features many added pockets on the inside.
I'm a 13W, and the shoe fit well... fit was a little on the big side. It was plenty wide enough (the wide size).
The D, 2E, and 4E are widths. D being medium, 2e being wide, 4E being extra wide. If you're not sure of the width, best to get measured at a shoe store before you buy.
Yes. For example if you are wearing size 10, choose size 10 2E US for wide size feet. (10 D (M)US for average size feet).

The C/D is just a wider fit, so only go for this if you have broad feet.
Absolutely! Just break them in a little first. I wear them 9+ hours a day and love them!
Unfortunately we are sold out in the size 8W. Regards,
Yes.
I'm sorry, this shoe has been discontinued by the manufacturer. The sizes in this listing are the only sizes we have available. Thank you for your inquiry. -MarcusUniforms
This shoe is discontinued. We truly apologize for any inconvenience. Please feel free to contact us for more information on the upgraded styles. We would be happy to help. -Marcus Uniforms
Hi Rosemary. These do run small. Buy C/D- wide width. I purchased mine in an 11 wide, a size up and a width larger than normal for me. They fit and feel like a size 10M. Hope this helps.
I had this same question, as I needed completely blak for work. The grey & yellow colors are on the shoe sole, so weren't a problem. The ordering was confusing, and I was afraid I would have to return them, so I was very happy that I received what I wanted.

Hi Rosemary. These do run small. Buy C/D- wide width. I purchased mine in an 11 wide, a size up and a width larger than normal for me. They fit and feel like a size 10M. Hope this helps.
I had this same question, as I needed completely blak for work. The grey & yellow colors are on the shoe sole, so weren't a problem. The ordering was confusing, and I was afraid I would have to return them, so I was very happy that I received what I wanted.
The C/D is just a wider fit, so only go for this if you have broad feet.
Absolutely! Just break them in a little first. I wear them 9+ hours a day and love them!

Around 4 to 5 feet
Same exact thing on both sides
Approx. 5 feet
Yes, it runs small. I ordered a 7-8 for when my son was 5 year olds and it was just a little big. He was about 42 inches at the time. Hope this helps
I would say yes that would be fine. It gave my son a little wiggle room and was not so skin tight.
It is separate and fits my son well. Great costume!
Idk the answer to that but I would suggest ordering a size up. my son barely fit into his.
my nephew is 5 year old and small was tight for him.
XS fits ages 4-6 , my son is 4 and the xs fits perfect , if you want it bigger so he can grow into it then small should work.
It is made of 100% polyester. Even though it is well past Halloween, he is still playing with it and it is still in good condition! Hope this helps. Sharon
No.the size,7/8.,get him bigger size. My child is 65 and it does not fit too small
My son wears a 7/8 and it is only a little big.

ummmmm. THEY DONT! These are halloween teeth.. Surely you know that?
Bought them both. Don't waste your money. Unless you are using them temporarily for Halloween. Very hard to modify.
the teeth i received were too small for an adult to fit and were made of a hard plastic that couldnt even be trimmed. it snapped in half before i could even use it
It is possible depending on the size you get but I would not suggest it
I'm sorry but we do not ship outside the United States.
No, they cannot be flossed. They give the illusion of individual teeth, but it is actually one solid piece. I purchased these for my son as a temporary solution when he had all four of his front teeth knocked out and the quote for implants was over $20,000. With no Dental Ins, he needed a quick cosmetic fix. These are inexpensive and actually look really good! There secret is to take your time and file, file, file and heat and mold, heat and mold, heat and mold! It's not hard - just time consuming. I think most of the negative reviews are people that don't take their time to shape them so they fit their mouths. I will also say that you should order several packages of the beads, because you will want to mold them and shape them and replace the wax at least once a month (this gives you a better, more comfortable fit since you will be taking them in and out periodically) Which leads to my next hint: If you're a smoker, take them out when you smoke! My son is a smoker and they will stain much faster if you don't take them out. Obviously, you won't want to take them out if you're out in public. But when you're at home, take them out if you drink a lot of tea or coffee - or smoke. It will definitely help to keep them whiter longer. Also, they will break if dropped. My son dropped his on a concrete floor and they broke in half. For the heck of it, I thought I'd try the other brand (Imako). At first, my son liked them better (less filing and fitting). But they definitely stained much quicker and we couldn't get them white again despite numerous attempt at soaking them in Efferdent and out of desperation we even tried soaking them in peroxide and bleach - nothing worked. The Imako's stain much faster than the Dr. Bailey's brand - just our opinion. All-in-all, these are a great cosmetic fix when you can't afford a trip to the dentist. But like I said, follow the directions and spend extra time filing and fitting and you will love them. If you have a little electric grinder (like the jewelers kind) they work wonders. But if not, just take your time with a metal file. I am about to order another Dr. Bailey's for my son, because like I said, the Imako has stained so badly and I am toying with the idea of asking a dentist how much he would charge to for a quick office visit to professionally fit the teeth to my son. Hey, doesn't hurt to ask and they have all the tools and could probably do it within about 5 mins. I've been thinking about it, so I thought I'd just see if anyone else has asked their dentist to do it. Anyway, no you cannot floss them, but they do look real - if you take the time to fit them properly! SMILE ;)
Hello, Thank you for your inquiry regarding our product. I can tell you per the package instructions you soak the veneer in hot water so it can be molded for maximum fit and comfort. **This product is not a "denture" or "dental device." It is only intended for intermittent use when you want to enhance your smile. Additionally, due to its hygienic nature, this product is non-returnable.
Yes, however the medium to large is a VERY old product and that size fits very few people. Get the Instant Smile and cut the shelf off of the back.
it seems to hold it's shape, but at the ocean it would blow up I think
4 inches, the brim does NOT droop. It is a nice fit, great hat. (and roll it into a ball, then sit on it, and unroll it and it is perfect! Very durable.)
You can pack around it, but it is not crushable like a cloth hat.
I'm a dude and I wear it all the time in the garden. I would consider it unisex, nothing really feminine or masculine about it. Just a good ol straw hat. I love it, pretty high quality too. I would def recommend.....cheers
It is in between. It does move with the wind but does not flop around on its own. You could probably hang light weight items but not sure how it would affect the integrity of the weaving.
Hi My information say one size fits all. and don't have a larger one. Thank you for your communication texasvalue
I took this on a plane trip, rolled it in my bag, but did not pack it flat. I can't tell that I ever rolled it. Hope this helps.
My head is a medium and it fits snug. The hat has an adjustable strap to tighten to fit snug. You could also put a bandana around your head like a head band and put the hat on over that if it is still too big after cinching up the strap. This is a really nice hat.
It is a really well made hat and does not let light through. I am very happy with it! I hope that helps!
It's at least 4in, currently out of town without it. Will measure tomorrow afternoon & send you exact measurement. It's an ample brim. Shade from it fully covers face & v neck chest area..
I am 6'3" 200 lbs and 34" waist. I wear a Large in these and they are great. You might want a Medium.
Order white and a pair of black
I bought a size 3x because I'm 5'7" 320 and needed compression . Had previously bought 3x and was very pleased with the compression support but the newer tights is made of a more nylon material with less support. Had to get size 2x to get moderate compression support. The older material was more like rubber and still going strong after 5 years of torture. If you are looking for compression support, maybe you should talk to UA directly regarding the best size.
Great
Hello, This particular model does not. However, there are woman's styles available.

I bought a size 3x because I'm 5'7" 320 and needed compression . Had previously bought 3x and was very pleased with the compression support but the newer tights is made of a more nylon material with less support. Had to get size 2x to get moderate compression support. The older material was more like rubber and still going strong after 5 years of torture. If you are looking for compression support, maybe you should talk to UA directly regarding the best size.
Great
Hello, This particular model does not. However, there are woman's styles available.

I only got the one size so I don't know for sure...sorry. These are good looking shorts with high quality zippers/snaps. But they are a little pricey. If you can get them for a good price you will not be disappointed.
Last item in product description says 9 1/2" inseam.
on me they're just above the knee. the picuture is correct.
My guess would be 5.11.
Funny you should ask! I am wearing one of my TacLite shorts (have four in different colors) as I pen this answer. Unfortunately, the side flap pockets are only 5" deep although they will accommodate the width OK. The two hip pockets do not have flaps but have a single velcro, center tab, closure. The opening is cut at the slant toward the front and would nicely accommodate your MP with the Otter case just fine. However, they are rear-side to rear in their orientation. I do not use those pockets normally because my iPhone fits perfectly inside the flapped pocket on the front left. There is another, smaller, pocket on the right front that is supposed to be for a MP but is much too small for a smart phone. I have been using my shorts for about 6 months and now, wear nothing else. They are awesome!

Mine are 16"
Dear Kathy, as far as we got told by a friend before ordering these, they should be made of latex free rubber material. And so far my wife ( she has very sensitive skin ) didn't have any problem with them. Hopefully this info was helpful, Arthur.
This is the only size we stock in the Stretch Magic Necklaces. If more sizes are available, I am not aware of it.
It's not really a clasp--one end just plugs into the other. The male end of the plug is slender and, being rubber, is pliable. At a guess, I'd say it was no more than 1/8" in diameter. I've managed to work it through the jump ring of numerous pendants. Hope this helps!
No assembly required. I do not know the weight, but I would estimate 30 - 35 lbs.
It is real wood.
Yes and then there is a flat surface/top as on a dresser or other furniture.
Dear Erica A., Thank you for your recent Home Decorators Collection purchase on Amazon.com. I would be happy to assist you today regarding your product inquiry. I apologize for the inconvenience. I am sorry, but I do not have this information available to me at this time. I have submitted an additional item information request about the Hampton Bay Jewelry Armoire.

Thank you for visiting our shop on Amazon.com. We look forward to your continued business. Sincerely, AngelaS. Internet Representative
Yes. All drawers and the two doors are fully lined.
Since you are ordering from Amazon, I am unable to state what sales they may or may not be having.

The sword is made of soft foam, it is kind of like a nerf sword.
This is M&d quality the award is around 20" and the shield is 12 *15
Yes...
I wouldn't purchase this for a ten year old unless he has a very slight build. I would say this fits sizes 4-8.
I think it might be a little small. My son (who just turned 6 and is wearing size 5/6) fits perfectly in this now. In a year it will probably be too small.
It's big on our three year old Grandson
Oh, I wish I could but I actually gave it as a gift for a 4th birthday boy. I do remember seeing him in it and it fit well on him & the parents seemed pleased with the quality. Sorry that I could not be of more help but hopefully this might help regarding the age.
It'll be big on the 3 year old, just about perfect for a 6 year old. Yes all the pieces shown come with it.
My daughter is five and is tall (she wears a size six clothes) and it fits her fine. She has plenty of room to move and grow. Her four year old sister wears the vest too, and at less than 30 lbs and a size 3T in clothing, it's big on her, but we just fasten the Velcro more tightly and it hangs down, but it doesn't bother her at all.
Foam, it is one entire piece of foam that was probably white at one point and is painted grey and black. This is actually my least favorite piece of the costume and definitely the lowest quality piece but I understand why it is foam since it is a kids toy. My 4 year old plays with it and loves it. The paint on the black handle has faded a bit and you can see the foam underneath but it still does the job. The rest of the costume is really amazing quality and has withstood many different ages playing with it.
Small fit 3 - 5 toddlers
Yes. The sword was included.
No, my 3, 5, and 6 year-old kids wear it.
I would think you could, my Grandson I bought it for is 3 also ! He loves it !
There is one vest and one hat
Yes! I would feel comfortable saying it is true to size. I bought it for a boy turning 5. It fit him well. It had plenty of room to spare and he was a normal size boy. It is well made and could easily fit for age 2 if the child was a little bigger.
I don't think this would fit a size 10- but I can't judge because my little one is a size 3T.
I'd say it's about a size 5 but would probably fit up to a 6x in the shoulders & body. On a younger child it would be more of a tunic and older more of a shirt. Again, it is very good material and the sword & hat are well made.
The feel the light hits both pages well. I do not have to move or adjust. I had this goose neck led light for a few years I had to keep twisting the light to hit pages as I read wearing out the light. This one once placed does well and allows me to read and a better speed.
Yes! this has a very thin metal paper clip type hinged piece on the back that will clip on a paperback cover nicely
Can't say because after several months this light is still bright. However, I have not used it everyday. I have used it twice a week for at least 1.5 hrs each time. Hope this helps.
Yes, because it's design allows you to clip to a thin amount of pages, or even better a sturdy hardcover.
No.
Flip the metal piece out, you'll see a panel you can remove to reveal the battery. I think there is some kind of plastic thing to keep the battery from draining prior to first time use. Just pull that thing out, replace the panel and you're good to go.
Not really, it's very thick. The light is terrible, and because of it's compact size the light bulb ends up being a bit too close to the book, and so it doesn't light the entire page well, particularly the bottom. Picture an 8 foot tall street light, it's not going to light as much sidewalk as a 25 foot tall street light.
I see one spot, guess led, but is very bright and works very well.
The cover does not require screws to replace the batteries, it just snaps offd and on
Two Lithium Cell CR2032 3V batteries are needed.
No, wind up Not fist quality, but cute.
happy holidays michael, the song is memories.happy new year
Memories, from the movie "the way we were"
Ours plays Feelings...
It's pretty much the color in the picture, maybe a slight darker but not by much
My child had just turned 3, and though it fit her, it was a bit big. I would say probably too big for a 2 year old.
It will fit! I bought it for my daughter who was 18 months at the time. Now she's 2 and 1/2 and it still fits.
Yes, very easily. I'm very happy with this purchase.
I think so. I have classic hoops, studs, large (2+ inches) and small hanging earrings. Earrings hanging on my holder have the following back types: French backs, latch backs, push backs, fish hooks and lever backs. The same day, I almost bought a jewelry armoire to match my furniture, which would have cost me a few hundred bucks. I am so glad that I purchased this instead. It's the perfect size, a great price, and it's pretty with the jewelry.
I don't use it for clip-on, but it should be fine! Actually easier than post earrings cause you have to reach through to put post on, but plenty of room to do that!
there was a threaded nut soldered into the base of mine. I just screwed the center post into it, put a drop of clear nail polish, and tightened it up. Mine works just fine. Hope this helped.
It says it holds 92. This is right unless the earrings are very big and take more than one hole each. Enev then it still holds a bunch.
It is approximately 2 1/4 inches from the bottom of each level to the top of the next level. The bottom level above the legs is approximately 3 inches to the legs.
I wear a 34. I have the large and they fit perfect.
My kid is scrawny as heck...5 '11" and 125 lbs. we got him a medium and he's got room to grow into it. Hope this helps.
Yes , they do have a cup pocket....we are pleased with this product
There are no thigh pads, just slots for them. Hip pads and tailbone pads are included and there is a slot to put a cup in there if you need to :) These are great for extreme sports too :)
Honestly, it doesn't provide much coverage in the hind area - it's a narrow honeycomb type strip 2" wide by 7". Not enough coverage for musculature on a random fall on the mountain, but it would cover if you squarely landed on your tailbone.
Yes, the model we purchased has a tail bone pad and hip pads There are also pockets for thigh pads and a protective cup(purchase separately)
Made in Germany and is written on inside of frame
Yes
Cant say for sure, but they work well for cycling and fishing. Seeems to cut down glare on the water while fishing.
Grasp the lens at the nose bridge and pull down away from the frame to remove the lens. To insert a lens, put the ends of the lens into the edges of the frame and then push the middle up into the frame until it clicks.
Your pliers need to be coated. Try tool magic it can be found in your craft shop
Bubble Padded Envelope, in plastic bag!
This bead measures approx 6.5 mm x 13.5 mm. A Pandora bead I am not sure about. I think they have different sizes. Here is the site, maybe call them or a local seller and ask them. http://www.pandoramoa.com/pandora-charms/murano-glass-charms.html
No it looks like a silver finish!!
It comes as one with no bracelet. Gorgeous bead!
I don't know. My Pandora is silver, so that's what I look for. Wish I had more info for you.
Nope, the neck strap is NOT adjustable. It's fixed. Comfort-wise, it is ok & it doesn't rub me the wrong way (pun totally intended)!
Yes
On the page for this apron you can select a package quantity of 1, 6, or 12.
To a certain it is. If you're working with a ton of water for more then 5 hours it seem to have the water start soaking in a little bit but not actually getting you wet.
Probably, but I am not sure.
No, I wouldn't iron it! Shake them out and just use it. They go away over time, not sure how long, exactly. Mine is smooth now.
I don't have it with me to measure, but here is how it fits on me: I am a heavier than average woman and 5'6". When I wear it, it comes to just below my knees. I don't have a long torso or long legs, am pretty normal there. I would say it is 41" without the neck. Hope this helps.
The one I received was brown.
about 10oz I'm guessing
Hello. Put it in the gift message section at checkout or email it
Unfortunately not. They will have the same personalization.
You can add the initials in the gift message section at checkout. Or. Once you place your order there will be a contact seller on your order. Use that so that it will be connected to your order.
Yes I am wondering the same thing. I would like to buy also but How do you get the initials on the cuff links?
SO far they have worked for me, but I have only tried them in the house, season is just getting started here. My hands are faily large and they have worked with eveything I have held so far.
Leather and canvas
Joe, I generally wear a small or medium glove depending on the style and manufacturer. Wrapping a tape around my knuckles reads about 8-1/4". I found the gloves comfortable except for the trigger finger which was a little tight. I bought them thinking they'd give me a little more dexterity so I wouldn't have to take them off to pick up small objects. They're a little cumbersome as the ends of the mitten part are squared off rather than rounded. Hope that answers your question. If not, get back to me. I'm not sure I'd buy them again, but I wouldn't return them as they're kind of cool.
They do come with liners they are wool
It should, as that's the idea of the design. You may need to work the liner well into the finger as it is a bit bulky - that helps with the cold protection.
This is a pair.
Made in China
Hot air but don't expect to dry wet boots very quickly...had it in Afghanistan where my boots got soaked didn't dry as quickly as I expected.
In would say the cord is about 8 feet long, they fit well in my flight deck boots size 10.5 very well so your 18 shouldn't be an issue.
Sorry.....but I have no idea!!! Sorry I can not help!
No
The size 7 boot is 12 inches from the floor to top of boot. On me, it goes well above the middle of my calf.
No, it's more a camo green.
Yes they do
Not sure bought them and they did not fit but fit my son so he wanted them we have wood floors never seen marks and he wear them in the house hope that helps.
No ,I can't see a CSA symbol anywhere on the boot.
The circumference at the calf of the boot is about 16 1/4". I then measured my own calf and that was about 14 1/4". My calf looks smaller than the two inch difference,but that's what the measuring tape read. Hope this helps.
Yes I think this boot will work for you
Soooo sorry it has taken me sooooo long to answer. Lots going on here during this endless winter in Michigan. Yes. The compartments are just over an inch square. I have a few big earrings & I put one earring in each compartment. There are lots of compartments. I have had this item for a while & I do like it. Hope I helped, Cindy, Allen Park, MI
The larger trays, like the one pictured, are 9" x 16" x 1 3/8" high. The smaller trays can stack double on top of the larger ones and they are 9" x 8" x 1 3/8" high.
if you took the drawers out of the plastic they sit in - you could certainly cut it down to size. If you tried cutting the plastic, it would splinter - I'm sure.
No cover.
My bottom trays are plastic then the top tray is a hard felt.
the size of?? the whole thing?? each separate little cubby?? sizes are indicated on the item's page.
I doubt that this case will prevent costume jewelry from tarnishing unless you have a similar case sitting on top. The purpose of this case is organization of earrings and other small items. I also have the necklace tray which fits nicely on top.
9"x16"
the size of this item. length, width, & height are listed under the product details.
I have silver in it, but it is still exposed at times and can tarnish over time. They are designed to stack on top of eachother, so I don't have a lid for the top organizer.
They are 8 1/2 by 15 1/2. I love both of them.
No, there is not. and it is extremely difficult to fashion one from clear plastic because I can't find a supplier. I've been to craft stores, Lowes, hardware stores with no luck. What I did was use the cardboard covering and paper punched holes in the edges and then used elastic string to thread an X over the top. This is fine for a dust cover but I prefer a see through cover. IF you want to find the same item in red flocking, with see-through covers and a variety of sizes, go to www.FreshFinds.com .
I don't have it handy to measure but that should be in the product detail info. I do not recommend this item as it does not come with a dust cover, which is annoying. I have not been able to find a suitable clear material, I can cut out, to make my own. I recommend ordering this similar item ( in burgundy) from "Fresh Finds. com.(which has many various sizes) That is where I got my original one and I bought two more. (all with dust covers)
I would not choose this style for bracelets. I use it for earrings. If you want to store individual charms it would probably work Ido not recommend this Axix 3331 item because it does not have a dust cover. There are other brands that are just as good and have many configurations and sizes to choose from that have dust covers.
1.5 inch high by 9 inches by 16 inches
3301 and 3302 have the dimensions of 8.125" X 9.25" X 1.375"
The dimensions of individual compartments are 1 1/2" by 1 1/2". Each compartment can hold 1-2 prs of earrings depending upon their size. It's a well made product and is great for organizing the jewelry.
The felt insert sits inside a rigid lucite form. I guess it would be possible to remove the felt piece and cut it. However, the beauty of these items is their stackability. I love being able to move two layers of these units within the drawer. I used two sizes to get the units to cover most of the drawer.
No, it does not.
Very easy to remove.
Yes
Each compartment is approx. 3/4" wide and 11" long. The big one in the end is 7-3/4 X 3". Some of my necklaces, doubled over, still hang over into the big compartment on the end. If the necklace is very thick, if isn't going to fit in the long slot compartment. The advantage of these, is that they stack. That is nice. You can either lift them off, or they kind of slide off. I have really enjoyed mine but I notice now that Michael's is selling something similar which you can actually see and touch. There is a disadvantage to not being able to see this. But I took a chance and I like them.
The tray itself is 8 3/4" X 15 1/2" X 1 1/8" deep. I sit it inside the plastic cover which is just slightly bigger: 16" X 9 1/8" X 1 3/8" deep.
No, no cover. What I do is to Stock one on top of the other, but the one on top is always uncovered.
As far as I know, no claims are made for the tray being anti-tarnish. I bought it solely because it looked like a nice way to organize jewelry-- and it is.
Sorry, i gave as a gift.
I bought "medium" for my wife's size 8.5 boots. They fit okay, but are snug when put on; it takes a firm tug. With age, the rubber will get less flexible...more breakable.
These are exactly the thing you need.
I bought a large for a mens 10.
If you refer to the Icetrekker website, they will tell you that a woman's 9.5 is a Medium
I wear a size 10 boot and asize large fits perfect. And the metal in the chains will break before the rubber goes bad
I got a size large for a size 10 boot
ICEtrekkers website says a Medium size fits 6.5-9. Large is size 9.5-12.5. My husband wears a size 8 boot and the Medium works for him.
If you are going to use them with regular street shoes, "7" is the high end for "Small." I assume you will be using them with heavier footwear for snow and ice, in which case "Medium" would be the right size.

I wear a size 10 boot and I use size large and I can barely get enough slack to get them on a 10 boot. I recommend a size xl for a size 11. Thanks Harvey
I wear a size 10 1/2 EEEE Adidas running shoe and it fits me. There is a design problem which I find and that is when walking the first part of the shoe to hit the ground is the back of the heel - this part does not come into contact with the treckers so if you hit an especially slippery ice patch the forward foot can slip up instead of rocking forward. this can result in a fall. Knowing this one can walk flat footed over obvious slippery spots, but you have to conciously change your normal walking gait.
I'd go with large.
a medium ...it goes up to size 9 for men. [10 for women] I wear womens size 8, I bought a medium and there is room to stretch more.[ I have them on bulky boots] I think a medium will be just at the edge for you. if you go up a size , the chains will be too loose.
I'm not sure of the answer, but if you go to their website and do the contact us link, they responded to my email question within 48 business hours and were very thorough. I definitely think they will be sturdier than yaktrax.
i wear a womans 9 for regular shoes and mens 9 for running and large fits just fine. better a little big than small
No.
Sorry, I have no idea. Perhaps you can contact the Ice Trekkers company and they can tell you. Good luck.
yes it will damage floors unless they are somehow scratch resistant, or carpeted
Wherever there is ice (no matter how thick or thin)...the cleats will work. Most of the time the lakes are snow covered and the cleats are not needed. But, if you really want to feel secure...put them on. Trust me...you will remain vertical.
You can very much run in these!! We had them tested for both running/walking together.

I bought "medium" for my wife's size 8.5 boots. They fit okay, but are snug when put on; it takes a firm tug. With age, the rubber will get less flexible...more breakable.
These are exactly the thing you need.
I bought a large for a mens 10.
If you refer to the Icetrekker website, they will tell you that a woman's 9.5 is a Medium
I wear a size 10 boot and asize large fits perfect. And the metal in the chains will break before the rubber goes bad
I got a size large for a size 10 boot
ICEtrekkers website says a Medium size fits 6.5-9. Large is size 9.5-12.5. My husband wears a size 8 boot and the Medium works for him.
If you are going to use them with regular street shoes, "7" is the high end for "Small." I assume you will be using them with heavier footwear for snow and ice, in which case "Medium" would be the right size.

I wear a size 10 boot and I use size large and I can barely get enough slack to get them on a 10 boot. I recommend a size xl for a size 11. Thanks Harvey

I'm a 10 1/2 size shoe and ordered the XXL. It fits but is not sloppy or over large. Sizing on carry bag is Men's--7/8(L),9/10(XL),11/12(XXL),13/14(3XL) Women's--5/6(S),7/8(M),9/10(L),11(XL).
Here is the link to Baffin's website and their size chart www.baffin.com/product-p/61310000.htm. I would suggest the XXXL just because 13 is the starting size for the XXXL.
It might. Without saying definitely yes or no, since their sizes reflect overseas manufacture. My size is 13 and oversize (XXL) fits well and is easy to get my feet into. If you want a snug fit, (a suggestion only) order same size. Otherwise, order oversize. When reading online reviews, most people do order oversize. Sorry for not committing. I don't want to mislead you. Be safe and don't buy a pair without knowing for sure you can return them if you don't like the fit.
No, I wear them at home, inside, during winter months. They are very warm, but not waterproof.
They do have a L & R
The specs say down, but I cant remember ever seeing feathers. Usually with true down products one sees a few feathers that punch through the nylon. That being said, they do keep my feet warm and sure feel like down slippers. I have had these slippers for many years and bought a second pair in anticipation that the first pair will eventually wear out. They havent yet and I have them on all of the time. Down or not, they were a good buy.
X large, the elastic cinches allow you to tighten them down.
I suggest size 9. You will love these booties as they are cozy and warm on feet and ankles.
I like them
Not at all water-resistant. If you step in a puddle you're in trouble. I wear them outdoors, to the store, and in the house barefoot. Get them extra big so you can step in and out of them easily. When I'm outdoors I am very careful about water. You can walk on a wet sidewalk, but you cannot step in a puddle. I would not wear them outdoors in heavy rain.

It might. Without saying definitely yes or no, since their sizes reflect overseas manufacture. My size is 13 and oversize (XXL) fits well and is easy to get my feet into. If you want a snug fit, (a suggestion only) order same size. Otherwise, order oversize. When reading online reviews, most people do order oversize. Sorry for not committing. I don't want to mislead you. Be safe and don't buy a pair without knowing for sure you can return them if you don't like the fit.
No, I wear them at home, inside, during winter months. They are very warm, but not waterproof.
They do have a L & R
The specs say down, but I cant remember ever seeing feathers. Usually with true down products one sees a few feathers that punch through the nylon. That being said, they do keep my feet warm and sure feel like down slippers. I have had these slippers for many years and bought a second pair in anticipation that the first pair will eventually wear out. They havent yet and I have them on all of the time. Down or not, they were a good buy.
X large, the elastic cinches allow you to tighten them down.
I suggest size 9. You will love these booties as they are cozy and warm on feet and ankles.
I like them
Not at all water-resistant. If you step in a puddle you're in trouble. I wear them outdoors, to the store, and in the house barefoot. Get them extra big so you can step in and out of them easily. When I'm outdoors I am very careful about water. You can walk on a wet sidewalk, but you cannot step in a puddle. I would not wear them outdoors in heavy rain.

Suunto core - my battery lasts about a year. I also have the ambit which is rechargeable and the battery lasts 3 to 4 weeks with normal use.
I had issues with my watch resetting every hour or so randomly. I sent them an email and they gladly replaced my watch with a brand new one!
Not my knowledge Ive only been able to have it the way it came in the image
Yes it does show temp. Although my went all weird and starter telling me it was 289 after about 2 years. Check out the Pathfinder from Casio as it is the same type of watch but solar powered. I have had mine for 2 years and no issues.
No you have to do it manually
yes it does
As far as I know, no, A B C, altimeter, barometric, compass. I was debating on this watch vs. a GPS watch, but I wouldn't use the GPS watch as much. I hope this helps&#128512;
No, it does not. Only sound alarm
No.
yes I think it would hold up against scratching. Since owning it and it not being the cheapest watch I worried about hitting it on things walking or moving things. I've even hit hard enough where I looked down just to make sure I didn't break the face. All it still well with not a single scratch!!
oh I got the small! If you want to layer or inseam is short I'd get medium
my son is 46 inches tall, we bought small it was right fit or bit short I think medium would be good, thinking large would be too big
I had the same problem and I went with the large now it will be a little bigger but if he plays with his costumes through the year I think it should be fine and the balloon on the abdomen part of the costume won't make it look extremely big...you can always order both sizes and return the other one I hope my information helps you
Small
I think medium size will fit him right
Last year my son was 50+ pounds and 50 inches tall and size M worked fine. It is in as good as new shape if you would like to buy it from me.
I wear my heavy pants outside the boots
Hello, We have updated our shipping options to include Alaska for a flat rate fee of $50.00. As you mentioned, the cost of shipping to Alaska is very high and we are not able to offer free shipping. I hope this helps! Thank you, Deb WinterBoots
They're made in Canada...
They are DEFINITELY waterproof. My husband bought these for when he has to work in a very remote place in Canada. They are great quality and you should have no problem with slush/snow.
I would recommend a size 12. I am a size 12.5 and I purchased a size 14 and they are about perfect.
They are made in China. excellent quality and they keep your feet warm
There is only one version of the Baffin Apex. There are two reasons that may account for the image differences. First, the liner appear either to be positioned very low, or was removed entirely for one of the photos. Second, the liners are not always the same color. It may be that one production run had a darker liner, while the other has a grey liner. The liners always have the same warmth quality, even if they look different. If you have any further questions, please contact us at http://winterfootwear.com/contact-us.html. I hope this helps!
I really don't remember. I gave it to my Grandaughter and it was already wrapped. So she plays it. And she loved it.....She is a teen ager also. So it was good for a big girl.
It plays "You Are So Beautiful"
Lois I don't remember and the box is already wrapped for presenting. I remember that it is a waltz. When I first listened I had pictured A Disney movie with the prince & pricess waltzing. So it must have been one of the old time waltzes. I am sorry that I can't help more, but I am leaving for the trip to see my grandaughter and give it to her.
Dear Granddaughter, This is a very special gift That you can never see The reason it's so special is It's just for you from me. Whenever you are lonely, or even feeling blue You only have to hold this gift and know I think of you. You never can unwrap it Please leave the ribbon tied Just hold the box close to your heart It's filled with Love inside.
My granddaughter has it at college - but if memory serves me it plays "You are so Beautiful"
Yes it holds mine but no padding or other protection so you would need to be careful. I have a Dell Inspiron if that helps.
The logo is sewn on.
It's def a khaki color, on the lighter side though. So not a dark khaki.
There is no velcro :) The front flap secures by way of a hook/latch, while the smaller pocket flap (located underneath the large front flap) secures with two metal snaps.
There is no side pocket. Although, I carry a water bottle around inside of it (it can stand up inside one of the inner sections) and also clipped to the metal strap clip. Both ways work fine for me. Something else you might want to know is that the "paratrooper" symbol is specifically an Israeli Paratrooper symbol, in case you're concerned with the kind of symbols you brandish. It's something I didn't realize until after I bought it.
I don't think you'll get strange looks haha
The logo is about 6.25 inches long by 3 inches high.
Never had one person criticize the bag nor recognize it as an Israeli symbol,here in floroda it jist looks like a retro bag with a red eagle/ bird on it. Its just stylish no political eyebrow has been raised at all. Hope this helps you
I don't recall, but over half of the flags don't stay locked. They're just gold colored metal with flag stickers on them.
Nope
the pin is enamel
The flags are approx. 3/4"x 1/2", a nice size for lapels. Finished very nicely. A good buy.
It is a stick pin, like a tie tack.
I am sorry, but I am not set up to do purchase orders. Hopefully, some of the larger dealers can help you. Good luck! Love4Home
Love4Home price has not changed. I would be glad to handle your order.
Definitely youth large. Also know that my daughter complains these are really hot.
It will be short, and may be too tight around the legs. I'm 6'3", 170 lbs., and I have some space around my hips and knees... I think it depends on how you're built (how thick are those legs of yours?) I don't know hip measurements, so your precision may be wasted on me. There's some stretch to them, not spandex, but some... Good luck.
not on the rear
I haven't the slightest idea. But you Are better off finding some comfortable and durable sweats and add padding to it. The reason is that these sweats are too hot and the padding is on the wrong places and is not good padding at all. I ditched them and goal kept playing indoor soccer using nylon sweats and padded undies and volley ball knee pads and that worked very well.
I am 5' 11" 30 w 33l and have a Adult Small
We returned them, as they were big for our six-year-old. But maybe if you have a very tall seven-year-old...
It should. How ever, I stopped using this item long ago, for it is too hot for use in summer days. You are better off customising a pair of sweats you are comfortable with by adding padding to them. The padding in this item is lame.
I received all 6 of the ones pictured, in equal numbers. Perfect for a birthday party.
I got 24 masks. The photo shows the 6 different colors which the masks come in, I believe.
One size fits most so probably yes
Adults or older kids
Yes, they are for adults.
7-9 yrs
Fits no more than a 4 year old imo unless they are very small. It is very cute, tho. Don't think it is adjustable.
Tag reads "Made in China".
My granddaughter is a 5.5 year old who wears around a 6 or 7. The smock fits her just fine, but the cap is a tad tight on her head. I'd say a size 8 child could wear everything, except maybe the cap.
Yes, lottsa room for massive groinal packages and everWidening buttocks... seriously - yes, very roomy... I have TruSpec, 5.11, and BlackHawk tactical pants - and they all are very roomy for my husky (aka, Rhino) thighs...
Yes, there is a vertical slit internally inside the pants to put in a knee pad. It is hard to see as it is close to the seam. That may be why people are answering "no". Per Tru-Spec site "Double reinforced knee with built in knee pad pockets"
It's a snap enclosure. There is also a button inside the pants just below where the top of the zipper starts. I haven't had a time where i needed to use it.
Yes they are. When purchasing be careful not to buy the cotton ones, they are much thicker and a bit stiff. I ordered these a few times already and love the slider waist, so comfortable!
No, they are pants.
Zipper and top button with inner button for extra security.
I've washed mine three times (with all clothes of all different colors, including whites) and they stay true black! I think the biggest issue, like with most black colored clothes, is lint. but it isn't too bad.
For sure the elastic sides have enough expansion to make up the extra inch, the legs also have plenty of room for thermals. I have two pair that fit great w/ or w/out firearm in an iwb holster
They actually are like 1 3/4 credit cards deep. They reach a bit lower than the bottom of the flap of the large cargo pocket. Sorry I didnt have a ruler at hand. And like Brian I own 3 pairs. Love these things as my travelling and work pants!
I would say yes. They do have a nylon-ish feel to them, and as such they aren't as thermally protective as a more cotton-based alternative might be, but I would feel comfortable wearing these even down in the 40s.

The outfit will be quite snug for a size 8-10. I am not a great judge when it comes to sizing but, don't believe it will fit above a 5T. My grandson wears a 3T and the outfit is a little big on him. I hope this helps.
My son's a size 5T (he's slim n average height for a 5 yr old) the sleeves are a bit long, so we roll them once and its boxy so it should accomodate a huskier build. We have the helmet set to a medium setting.
No
I don't think so.
It's adjustable so I am sure it will be fine ( it adjust at the front and back )
It was plenty big for our 5 year old grandson. He is thin so that could be a factor. He loved it!
Yes, it will be too big to use right now. However your grandson could play with the hat and other accessories that are part of the set.
the material is thin but will be great for year-round play. they can wear it over their shirt. it is really cute!
We just used his black sports pants and rain boots.
All Melissa and Doug costumes come sized as "sized for age 3-6 years"
Hi - I purchased these shoes several months and love them. I use them for cross training, hiking and walks with my dog, so i would say, yes, to the treadmill and eliptical. Hope this helps!
I would say that it is a slim fitting shoe but not so much that it is a problem. the only thing I would say is that because they are slim fitting I would go with a size that is true to you foot. i.e not a sneaker size that is typically a 1/2 - 1 size bigger. They are beautiful though!
Made in Romania - excellent quality.
No they don't I added those running arch supports, which made them much more comfortable.
The B is the width from what I have read online B is a standard width. Check out this link it explained widths pretty well http://www.ebay.com/gds/The-Foolproof-Way-to-Finding-Your-True-Shoe-Size-/10000000177630037/g.html
I thought the M stood for men???
Size 42
womens 81/2 is 39
I don't know, My wife never wear it in rain.
spray them with a Water Repellant from a local shoe store or shoe repair once a month. For dust and quick upkeep, use a stiff plastic bristle brush. For larger stains, the nubuck material will hold up to light spot cleaning with a small amount of Woolite.

I think mine are 9-11 Rodolfo.
Thin and not tightly woven. Pretty poor quality.
They could stretch up to 9, so I suppose that 7 1/2 would be good to. My husbend wears them every day for 3 or something months and they are ok.
I'm a size 10 1/2 men's shoe and the socks are perfect.
I'm a 10.5 and they fit with a little slack, an 11 should fit perfectly
Shoe size 6-12.
I would say men's 7-9.

I would say men's 7-9.
I think mine are 9-11 Rodolfo.
Thin and not tightly woven. Pretty poor quality.
They could stretch up to 9, so I suppose that 7 1/2 would be good to. My husbend wears them every day for 3 or something months and they are ok.
I'm a size 10 1/2 men's shoe and the socks are perfect.

Hi BD, The dimensions of the "Boot Scrubber" are 6" wide by 9" long. I attached it to a piece of 3/4" Advantech 11 1/2"x 20 1/2" (scrap width). This allows you to stand on one end while cleaning your boot/shoe. I also placed three 11" strips under the platform to allow for drainage.
Yes, I just put it on a 2' section of 2x6 right in the middle and stand on either side with the foot I'm not cleaning.
I anchored mine to my wooden deck, but if you try asphalt you will need to use lag bolts or lead shields to keep it in place
Yes, it's got holes to screw it down to the deck or porch. Holds it in place just fine, it's very sturdy.
It looks like they are, as they're merely screwed in place. But you'd have to find a supplier to get the proper size. The frame in which they are positioned seems like it is quite solid and durable, so I can imagine the frame would outlast a well used set of brushes. The vendor who sells these on Amazon might carry replacement brushes, or be able to identify a source.
Correct. We use our leaf blower to clean it out. Works well.
Outer package states: "Made in China". No surprise there. But it is a good solid product. Bought mine at the local ranch & home store for $20 each. Came to Amazon looking for replacement brushes. None here. None on the manufacturers web site, www.jobsite.bz , either. Just have to replace the whole thing when the time comes. Screwed mine to boards. Didn't want to drill hole in the concrete patio, although the supplied hardware looks like it would do the job.
I don't think that this would comfortably fit a VERY skinny adult.
I only ordered one tutu.
Looking for light pink. do you have that color? How do I choose pink?
Yes, I had my 2 year old grandchild and my 4 year grandchild both wear the tutu. It worked well for both.
These truly are "one size fits all". They have been worn by 7 year olds, as well as my 14 year old daughter. She actually likes to layer them to give a fuller look.
I'm just a customer who bought one and it was in white.
This umbrella has almost one pound weight.
of course, thats why i bought it
Yea of course!!! As a matter a fact I been using it a lot lately since it's been raining so much here in Texas. It's a great umbrella!
Yes
No
Dark green. The umbrella works great for very strong sun!
Yes
Yes it can. Although it shouldnt rain too hard
The umbrella is indeed 42 inches spoke to spoke. Its a small umbrella . In addition. ..it is not reliable. Seek dun coverage from the Coolibar golf umbrella (which is not overly large but VERY durable. )
When the umbrella is folded down it is 11 1/2 inches (290 mm). When open tip to bottom of handle 22 inches (560 mm).
No, it isn't. Some type of hard plastic.
14-5/8" x 8-1/4" W, 2-5/8" D, outer dimensions. I recommend you buy the optional bottom liner.
A video game in a case would fit. Plus a card
You can fit 4 xbox game cases.
boiling water will most likely cause producing very toxic substances which (like the tea bags of this kind) are contributors to cancer and other health problems. So, I do not recommend using those bags in high temperatures. those bags will do great for lavender and little gifts but stay away from making a tea in them or washing in boiling water.
of course
Not a normal deck of cards, no. The bags measure 3.5" wide by 4.25 " tall, however the actual holding area is a 3.5" square with the upper 0.75" housing the drawstring (ribbon really). The material is finer than gauze and quite sheer.
Forty eight and they were very nice
10.16 cm x 12.7 cm
They might be - the weave is nice & tight, so small pieces of herbs won't fall out, creating a mess. But my guess is that you'd prefer to use a cotton or muslin pouch for something like that - a natural material, rather than a synthetic. I'm sorry, I can't be of more help than that.
Should fit without problems,
Yes
Yes, if it is truly a small bottle of polish.
You will get 48. Mine came with 48. They're awesome but they do take a little while to get here because of the distance in shipping. Great deal though.
YES! I stack them up to four high on the shelves in my closet.
The case is a very good size. I do believe it can hold cuff links. There is a lot of room from the glass top to where the cushion is.
I don't think this will work for earrings. It is slotted for the shank of the ring to fit in. If the earrings are studs only and small, it might work, but I would recommend the jewelry storage case/earring cufflink boca by Mele. That is what I use for my earrings and it works perfectly. Amazon carries it too and it costs $25 and comes in different colors. Hope this helps.
The box is made of a heavy duty cardboard covered with a black washable covering. The cover is glass. It is sturdy and is a great display case.
It is about 2 inches
I don't know what kind of material it is but it is something like foam with slits for the rings.
Yes it sure does. Very nice display case too.
Yes a d yes, the foam is removable. I ended cutting the foam up in squares to make little cubicles for my earrings. Love it!
I gave this as a gift, so I do not have it to give exact measurements, but it was around 12" X 6".
I think you can do it if you are talking about the ring box! Each row is slits as long as the cuff links aren't two long! You do have a little room in the lid it doesn't lay flat across!
I don't know what he is asking.
It is five-eighths of an inch thick.
This case would work for pins. I've very happy with the cases; I have rings and pins in mine and they look very nice. The cases are much better quality than I expected for the price.
Yes, the insert is included.
Glass ... and it's perfect for storing my rings. I'm very pleased with it!
The foam that hold the rings in place is very flexible, it works fine for wide band rings.
Yes it will hold a boys championship ring perfectly.
Cufflinks with a bar back would work, but not those with a chain connecting the front and back.
Yes it does.
Yes, it does. I have one and love it!
Dear Sya, These are actually yellow and not orange. If you would like to make a color selection there should be a section to add a note at the end of your order and if not then please don't hesitate to contact us directly through email or call us for order customization.
Only one
It has a ribbon attached to it that you can hang around your neck or tie to something. Don't pull too hard though or it will detach from the ball.
On the inside there is an inner pocket that fits a kindle. I'm assuming an iPad would fit? Also on the Velcro putter section there is another pocket that would work. I love this bag.
I am not sure what size the Kindle 8.9 is but a large book definitely fits. Your checkbook will get lost in the large compartments. Lots of space, lots of good spots to hide pretty much everything.
Will hold an iPad easily ... 15.6 laptop, no. Look at the dimensions.
It would stick out of the top but it could fit a mini IPad.
I am not familiar with this equipment. I once had a 35 m Canon with 1.5 lens, it would have fit but not extras and wallet etc would have had to reduce
Yes
Mine is black on the exterior and has a light blue lining.
Yes it will hold an IPAD. I've had my bag for a couple years now and LOVE it!!
No, it does not have an open pocket or sleeve to attach it to luggage pull-up handles.
I'm not completely sure. I'd say the 10X7.5. I tried to measure but it's hard with all my stuff in it. I can say that I LOVE this purse. I lose interest quickly with most all purses, but this carries everything, is comfortable, not to heavy, thick strap, sturdy, awesome drink carrying sides. I'm planning on getting another color soon. I accidentally commented on the wrong color. (mine is black) I hope this helps.
Hi; It runs large. I'm 5'4" and it nearly touches the ground. Also ~ the color is very different than what is shown. The yellow one is actually a dark mustard color.
Yes and yes. They are very nice but run very big. Dori S.
Hi Tricia. I'm 5'4" and the jacket almost touched the ground when I walked. But. .. when I was on a horse, I was very well protected. I had room for layers of clothes under it. Had to roll the sleeves up. .. they're pretty long.
Yes
Not attached but it snaps on
Men's sizing.
i have the last 4 uncented 1 black 2 blue with stars and one light blue thanks
Dear Mary, Thank you for your interest with Nature Creation Hot & Cold heating packs. Nature Creation products filled with high quality Natural Herbs and Grains, the herbs provide the soothing aroma and the grains maintain the heat. As an authorized dealer for Nature Creation products Green royal can provide you unscented Shoulder Wrap this mean that the products will be filled with natural grains of whole wheat and Flax seeds. You can place your order at our Amazon store, once order placed send us an email with your special fulfillment request. Thank You The Royal Green Team Store front:
Yes, it is lightly scented. Mine is about a year old and gets lots of use and I still slightly smell lavender and a hint of spice.
Yes. the red one is available to order and we have it in stock.
I have only owned the shoulder wrap for a few months (about 4 months, I think). So far it has retained its aroma. I am sorry that I cannot speak in terms of years.
I have never tried heating the wrap in the oven. You may want to contact the manufacturer. In the meantime, I would advise against placing the wrap in the oven as I suspect the beads on the inside of the wrap are meant to respond the near instantaneous and intense heat of the the microwave.
Since it is Amazon fulfilled order, the colors are randomly chosen. We do not have control over that option. I hope I answered your inquiries. Thank you for shopping with LDSL CA Inc. Store
Couple of pounds. Someone wrote 3/4 of a pound. I have several of these and none weigh less than a pound.
Lavender and chamomile
18 inches long 11 inches wide
I Don't have any experience with the small. The Medium is what I wear and my wrist is 7 inches. It is a little snug but not too snug as I wear it all day comfortably. I could probably wear a large with no problem. Hope this was helpful and good luck.
I wear the trion bracelets with the two circles next to my skin. Works great for me. Good luck.
Sorry I was buying the bracelet for Xmas gift.he is wearing the bracelet for playing golf.i suppose doing something with balance, cordination
Wind up
The dimensions can be found if you scroll down under product dimensions. But here they are anyway 11.2 inches in length x 7.8 inches in width and 4.5 inches in depth. Also it ways 5 pounds.
I believe it is the Nutcracker suite?
9 is the length and B is the width. The (M) stands for "medium." B always represents medium, the (M) is redundant. I guess they say (M) in case someone doesn't know what width the B represents. AA is narrow, D is wide. Numbers always indicate the length, letters designate width.
I usually wear a 9-9 1/2 in sandals and I tried these in a 9 (no 1/2 sizes available). The length was fine. I don't think going up to a 10 would have helped in this particular shoe. It was just too tight going across the top of my instep area. The length of the shoe was not the issue for me. Hope this helps!?
I've used a combination of oxy clean and water and a toothbrush and had decent success.
I got my wet on a rainy day and they did stretch a little around the toe. They are very comfortable now.
My feet are wide and measures at an 11e/w so I bought an 12 just to be on the safe side and I could have gotten the 11. Also, it takes a little while for the elastic around the toe to stretch, so if your feet are wide and you want comfort right away go with the larger size. I have a pair of 11 and 12 and both are great fits! I hope this helped
No, I ordered an 8 and in some shoes I require a 8.5 but this shoe in size 8 fit perfect.

I usually wear a 9-9 1/2 in sandals and I tried these in a 9 (no 1/2 sizes available). The length was fine. I don't think going up to a 10 would have helped in this particular shoe. It was just too tight going across the top of my instep area. The length of the shoe was not the issue for me. Hope this helps!?
I've used a combination of oxy clean and water and a toothbrush and had decent success.
I got my wet on a rainy day and they did stretch a little around the toe. They are very comfortable now.
My feet are wide and measures at an 11e/w so I bought an 12 just to be on the safe side and I could have gotten the 11. Also, it takes a little while for the elastic around the toe to stretch, so if your feet are wide and you want comfort right away go with the larger size. I have a pair of 11 and 12 and both are great fits! I hope this helped

No it does not come with an wrist strap unfortunately, but if you meant the lanyard to wear around your neck it does come with that and is attached by a lobster claw type
Smooth, engraved yes.
No, they do not. Great idea though!
Battery.
I can't tell you exact dimensions, but it is the same size as a normal wrist watch so tin not huge or to small...

If you go to the yaktrax pro website (yaktrax.com) you will see a size chart there.
Yes, you must be careful in putting these on before venturing outside. I always make it a point to sit on the step and put them on my running shoes to ensure I dont scratch up my wood floors, small price to pay when I get the traction needed to do my long runs in snow and ice conditions.
Yes....This listing is for Size: Small (Fits shoe size: Women 6.5 - 10 / Men 5 - 8.5)
I ordered the small-medums for a female size. 8 shoe and they work very well. I believe the posted shoe sizes are very accurate. Note I had purchased these for my trail running shoes and they are awesome even on ice.
No....This listing is for Size: Small (Fits shoe size: Women 6.5 - 10 / Men 5 - 8.5)
I am not sure about the mud. I use these on the sidewalk, bike paths, and single track through the woods. They are great on ice and snow.
Thank you for your question. They conform to the natural shape of your shoe or boot. Here is the sizing chart: Small: Men's sizes 5 - 8.5 Women's sizes 6.5 - 10 Medium: Men's sizes 9 - 11 Women's sizes 10.5 - 12.5 Large: Men's sizes 11.5 - 13.5 Women's sizes 13 - 15 X-Large: Men's sizes 14+ Women's sizes 15.5+ Warmest, Dorsey D.

I can't determine from the packaging, but I will check further. Thank you for raising the question.
Dear Customer, Yes we do we have about 60 in stock at the moment.
Use it in Vegas as a fridge for drinks. Works with ice...no leaks! Love it!
This item does not have a inside divider.
I have a 38" waist and the ties are long enough to wrap around me and tie in the front - comfortably.
I'm 5' 3" and it goes to my knees. I actually would have liked it longer. If you have a longer torso, the bib will probably fit better, but it's OK for me.
Absolutely not. I'm 6'1 and 32 waist. Comes halfway down my thighs, and ties around kidneys.
No, the neck strap is not adjustable.
Not sure. Was a gift for my nephew. I know he loves the apron.
Hi....I measured it as 11-11.5 inches for the chest area. Cheers
Too big for small woman in my opinion. I am 5'9' and like the size, and it works ok but i dont love the material, not absorbent enough
No it's not but if you need to adjust length it can be done easily with sewing machine &#128522;
We only sell these aprons as each. With Amazon there can be multiple sellers for a single item. Amazon gives the customer a great choice so the customer will get exactly what they need.
Not real big. I can place my hand in each pocket.
Is he a good cook worthy of it?
I measured my hat and the Velcro closure adjusts from a 25 inch circumference down to 19.5 inches. (You could even put a few stitches in and make it even smaller. Hope this helps!
Hi It give's you latest receving date. I will send you by First class mail, you are gone receive in 2-3 days.
I think that it would be just fine to do that!
Starched heavily, stuffed or wire frame.
It's size is 13"
Yes! It has a velcro, so you can adjust it! I recommend it 100% :)
Chima
Hi, Yes you will receive before Nov 14 .
It has a Velcro strip
Hit Alt + F4
Yes, it's huge!!
No, this mask is made for adults.
The two sides open and they hang along the sides. Doors are taped shut when you get the item.
Mine looks like the one listed. I've been very pleased with it. I've now had it for over a year. It looks terrific!
My drawers don't have drawer glides, but they slide pretty smoothly. There's not much friction interfering with the sliding of the drawers.
No, it does not have a lock.
It's been so long ago for me. I had no trouble figuring it all out and it all worked beautifully. All the screws fit send it was great. Sorry I can't remember anything more or complicated about it. Good luck! It's a beautiful, functional piece of furniture!
Closed: 20.62"L x 15"W x 42"H Open: 35"L x 15.5"W x 56"H I'm not sure if the L measurements are actually for width or depth or if they include opening the drawers on the front or the side panels.
Bag is approximately 20 inches wide with a height of 15 inches.
Lays absolutely flat could be the placed on the bottom of your suitcase.
I've asked about that too! You will get the pink, since we don't have a bag that is just blue anyway.
yes the bottom is mesh. sand can get in bag..but it also allows sand to leave bag and all items to drain and dry while in the bag
It's all mesh...the bottom is mesh....I think. I regret buying for the price.....it is big and lots of pockets....but for $35.... The bottom may have a liner.....it's just not in front of me to be sure. I'll send you mine if u like.....I don't need one that big
I'm using it for an airline travel bag, haven't a used it yet for the beach!
The bag is a thick dark mesh so its not as transparent as most bags. You can also wrap you undergarments in a towel or shirt if you want to further protect them. I love my bag and you will too!
Yes, it works on wood. There are some glues that expand and end up with air in the dried glue. Not this stuff. It's solid when it comes out of the tube, when it goes on, and when it dries. . . and it holds on like grim death. Getting it off where you don't want it is nearly impossible.
This stuff should be called miracle shoe goo. Yes it will work.
I believe it would work on any rubber sole. I always clean and degrease the affected area with Acetone first.
I initially intended to put a heel on, but I ended up just filling in the holes. I think the replacement heel would fit, but it will likely stay on until it wears out because this stuff sticks very well.
You can use this stuff anywhere. It's basically a semi flexible epoxy. I've used it to mend a cabinet. The trick is once applied wait a good 48hrs before using. The product needs to cure properly.
contains tuolene and petroleum distillate and has a poisonous vapor warning, so probably a no go for you.
I did not hold or clamp after to first 10 minutes or so and it worked as promised and has held up great so far. You can't even tell that the sole had been separated at a point.
If the slit is on the impact zone of the sole of the shoe it will not secure it for a long time. It depends on the size and shape of the slit, how deep it is, and how hard you step on it. If it is a regular (walking) shoe, probably not a problem, If it is a running shoe...Please refer to the before mentioned statements....
I used it on my wives boots and it worked fine. I also used it on my work boots and it did not work well. I would stick to using this on tennis shoes or boots like you mentioned.
3.7 oz (109.4 ml) enough for a couple of pair of shoes (soles / sides) Keep the cap area clean and close TIGHT and it will LAST and stay loose. roll up from bottom and keep GOO right to the brim when closing (Minimal air)
Hi Danielle, my son is a pretty big 4 yo. 4T i too small. He wears mainly size 4 in little boy clothing now. Based on the other review (a 6 yo who wore a medium 8-10), i ordered the size small. I hope it works out! I'll post a review once it comes in.
My son wears an xs or small (size 5). We bought a medium because these ran small and we wanted room for him to be able to run around and wear this costume over other clothes. It was a little big but it worked well.
The height would be up to 54".
Just a mask.
Sorry I don't have an iPod touch but my Daughter does and she has the ipod touch, the pocket is too small, but the Backpack is great with lots of other room. We bought 2.
I use it as a gym bag and it has a pretty generous amount of space. The zippers can be attached pretty loose so I would recommend taking some pliers and tightening them if you go with this bag. The other problem you may have is this bag is so big, it won't fit into your standard gym locker. On any given trip to the gym I stuff into this bag: 2 large towels 1 small hand towel Full change of clothes Flip flops Bathing suit Cap and goggles Cannister style shower bag Make up bag Brush Grocery bag full of fruit Wallet, keys in side pocket Lotion, body spray, and comb in other side bag And after you work out, there is a spearate section to put wet/stinky clothes
It may have to do with the storage compartments. The bottom is separated for shoes and then there are several side and interior compartments. I bought one for my husband and myself and it fits ALL our cycling gear perfectly.
China.
I'm sorry. I don't know. Cuz it was for a gift,
I am not sure but it is large en po ugh to carry all my tri gear need. It also has dangling carabiners in case you would need to have more stuff hanging outside. I have the option of having the helmet hang outside or packed nicely inside the bag.
It would depend. My son is 4, and tall but very skinny. It is too big on him, but wearable. I would say that it would probably fit an average sized child of 6 or 7.
Bought both police and fire costume, both are great but fire one is superb! Previous answer was terrific so hard to add anything else. I would say from memory no keys and handcuffs just close without locking.
Hello. These Pretend-Play costumes by Melissa & Doug are for 3 Years + (one size) Not suitable for infants.
It does not neccessarily specify, but it looks as though its maybe a 4T-5T
A few garbled words and static. It really does sound like a police radio with static. The child can play it over and over by pressing the button. Have a 9 volt battery, which the radio needs, available when the costume arrives.
It says one size but I would estimate size 4T-5T
I don't think it specifies, but bought for my son last Christmas and still fits. He'll be 5, Dec 7 and avg size, 43", 45 lbs
my grandson is 2 but tall. my daughter said it is big on him but he has a blast with them, I got him the officer and the vet sets. .so I would say it's more for like a 4yr and up. hope that helps
My son is pretty small & was 5 yrs old when I bought. If he's a bigger child I'm sure it wld
my grandson loved this costume.. set is not TWO of the cop outfits..it is just one complete set, cuffs, jacket hat..etc.
They come as a pair.
I love them. Cuts out the heat as I drive and protects my hands and arms. Highly recommend !!!!
At 5'4" and 140 lbs, I ordered and wore the size Small - I was concerned that it was going to slide off my arm so I went with the smaller one, even though I do not consider myself a "small" size usually. They are "compression" type sleeves, so they are pretty tight and have some impressive stretch to them - I always found them comfortable and not too tight while staying put well. Sometimes while hiking (a lot of activity and moving arms around) I found I had to slide them back up onto my shoulder, but overall comfortable!
There's a size guide here: http://www.eclipsesunsleeves.com/
They come in a pair (2)
they are super stretchy, so probably so. They fit me, a slim woman, and my son, a muscular young man
No, they are not that long. When I wear a short-sleeved top, they go up to where the sleeves end on my arms. Definitely not all the way to the shoulders, so they would not work with a sleeveless shirt/top. Generally mine stay up pretty well, although I find they are slipping more with the more I wear them & the older they get. It will also depend on what size you have, how large (and long) your arms are, and how active you are while wearing them. I have used mine hiking & bike riding and have loved them; they actually make my arms feel cooler and I love the way they protect the top of my hands in addition to my arms. I've recommended them to friends and have already purchased 3 pairs myself.
Go with large.
Sizes are small, medium, large according to the website. I ordered the small size and they fit perfectly, I am 5'3 and 125 lbs
I wouldn't know, I am 97 pounds..... I took small and they are o.k. Sorry.

Mine did come with a battery. There was a small plastic tab to remove which then allowed the watch to work.
I had to buy a new band for it. It broke the first day that I had it on and almost lost it.
It is big enough for an average size woman. However it is cheap. Had to buy a new wristband because the "buckle" part broke and I almost lost it.

The sizing chart on the package reads: XS=Womens size 4-6, S=Womens size 6-8, M=Womens size 10-12, L=Womens size 14, and XL=Womens size 16
The label reads it is "100% pure silk/sole. It is machine washable & I hand to dry. Comfortable & warm. It's called "Thermasilk". Only downside, it's made in China!
I don't have my exact measurements but I wear a size 6 (or 8 petite) and am 5'2", 130#, and the med fit me a bit loosely but not to the point they "bunched" under my jeans.
Large=sz 13-14, med=size 11-12, small=sz 9-10, xs=7-8. Petite means shorter in the waist down as in the long johns or shorter in the waist up as in blouses. The fabric is thin but under any pair of pants gives me a nice warmth for 32 degrees F. without making the over pair of pants uncomfortable or tight. Probably would not be warm enough for Alaska winters which can get 50 below.
Best to say they are a second skin. We have had 26 degree temps, but I haven't been out for more than 30 min. They don't make you warm & fuzzy, you would need heavier thermals. I find I can wear them even to work, helping get to & from the car & not overheating me while indoors. Hope that answers the question.
They have a loose fit. If you want them to fit like panty hose, order a size or two down.
I would say that XL would fit someone up to about 190 lbs. and up to about 5'8"... I am 5'7" and 160 and they were a bit long.
82 grams
I went to their website(Terramar)....... It has a sizing chart indicating various measurements.
They didn't chaff on me, but I did not ride a bike. They are like pantyhose, just slightly heavier.
I think the size is right on. I wear a 7.5 most of the time and sometimes go with a 7 in an open toed sandal and an 8 if I want a bigger sock. I have the shoe in a 7.5 and an 8 (I now have three pair) and the 8 is slightly long - but I like to put a hiking sock in it sometimes so I needed the extra room.
I have bunions but they are not too big. These shoes are very comfortable and I usually have problems finding shoes that are wide enough.
The inner sole is removable, and I've replaced it with a Spenco one.
They are low tops.
No. This is not a waterproof shoe. I have found the breath ability to be good.

The best answer is both! It is 16" tall but its just as wide. and yes its 40" long. GREAT bag! I bought 10 of to use as coaches bags for our Lacrosse program 3 years ago and all 10 are still going strong and these bags really take a beating! Hope this helps!!
It has a sling and the handles are large but i dont see how it could be used as a standard backpack. Plus with its size it would be extremely akward to do so.
Diameter. The circumference is pretty big, probably around 40 inches. I'm a massage therapist so I carry sheets and cushions and lotions, etc. It holds about 10 sets of (twin) sheets plus other equipment. It holds a lot!
No wheels
No there is not but there is a slight protective coating but I wouldn't trust it to putting electronics
The material is very tough. I don't think that a barrel will poke a hole in this bag. The bag is huge and that may be more of a concern than the material for you. You will probably need some other type of cushioning to carry around a rifle in this type of bag. It is very well made and the material is strong.
Seems like a nylon/poly blend. The bag itself is very strong, the fabric seems to have rip stop qualities. It is the strap, specifically the plastic strap buckles/hooks for the shoulder strap that are weak. I needed to reinforce mine with metal buckles but the bag itself has taken a serious beating since I got it and is still going very strong.
As long as the equipment isn't over 20-30 lbs in my opinion...in my experience my hockey equipment was too much for the straps and caused the large over the shoulder strap to break at the end of the zipper...causing the zippers to fall off. Hope this helps.
depends on the specs of the tent, but my best estimate is yes it can fit a 4 person tent.
When I checked the bag with an airline, it was considered "oversize" and I was charged extra.
Yes. I bought a large for my eight-year old daughter, and it works for her if we pull it back a bit, but it also fits me.
Yes it will. I believe the small size is for babies. It was hard to tell. The large fit just fine in this age range...
We have black bonnets in large, but not X-Large.
It's just one bonnet, with no choice of color. The one I received was a medium blue floral.
It's alway different
We do not have that specific bonnet in stock.
I'm sorry, I only have one for sale.
If you have placed your order, you can email us at amazon@cashco1000.com to make your request. However, I can't guarantee that your color choice will be pulled once the order reaches our warehouse.
1 bonnet
No,and they are poorly made. Very loose and awkward.
smoke lenses
I have no idea
I also have bunions. These Sloggers are so comfortable, a little too wide for me, but that is because I am an 8.5 and had to get the 9, but I absolutely love these garden shoes. I wear them every day to go outside and do things, then just hose them off and keep them on the porch. When I wear a sock, they are perfect for a rain day.
I would get a size 7 you can always wear a thicker sock
Just wipe over with a damp cloth~inside as well.
For me, the sizes ran true. I wear and 8, ordered an 8 and it was a perfect fit.
Nope - they fit me great and sometimes I have to buy wides!
I am not sure, but have you tried using course grit sand paper to rough up the sole? Perhaps a heavy cut wood rasp would work.
I wear between a 6.5 & 7. I too was concerned about the fit, I ordered the seven and they are perfect, snug on the top of the foot and my toes get to breath. The snug fit keeps the dirt out of my shoes when digging without cutting off circulation. I am amazed at just how comfortable, durable and cute they are!! Hope that helps!
I would say it is availability, if there are more pairs in stock of your size than another pattern, they would be slightly less expensive.
The shoes? Wet cloth.
Iam a medium width and they weren't tight on me.
I normally wear an81/2 or 9 and I got a 9 but my foot is wide. They fit great. Hope that helps. They are roomy on me.
Mine fit perfectly I wear a women's ten happy how they fit
I consider these to have a low back heel. I have had other shoes that did have a high back heel and those came so high on the heel that it pressed into the back above the heel. These are below the ankle area.
I would say get the 8 if that's your normal size. I wear an 8 1/2 but they didn't have half sizes so I went one up and their too big.
Sorry, Miki, have just checked my pair & don't find that problem. Perhaps it's a defect in your pair.
Hello Barbara! I just took a picture for you how they look on my feet and try to edit my review so that you can actually see the back. The weight is exactly 1.8 lbs for both shoes. All I can tell you is that these gardening shoes are extremely comfy and worth the money! I hope i could help... Have a nice day!
Hi, no excuse for not answering this question sooner! I apologize. Actually, we do make a size a size 11 in Midsummer Black and Midsummer Blue. The reason I don't put it on Amazon is that it may be confusing, because the customer will see the size 11 option for all of the shoes, but it is only available in those two prints. Call the office to order the size 11's and tell them I said to use the Amazon price listed here. It looks like it's $21.88 today. Yours, David Hoyt President Sloggers USA 310-532-3411
I would suggest a 9. I usually wear a 7.5 -8 and the 8 is a teeny bit big, but I have narrow feet and never wear them with socks. However, a lot of other reviews say to order down, I would order an 8 again
Yes you could walk long distances if you wear good pair of socks! Your feet sweat too much if worn too long without socks!! I find them very comfortable. I have to wear them half a day when I'm working in the barn when it's raining and my feet have never hurt!!
I would get a plastic container large enough to fit your Sloggers. Fill it with enough water so the grooves are covered. The shoes may start to float. If they do, just put a clean rock inside the shoes. I've tried those porcupine style shoe scrappers. They were a waste of money. I always leave a chair, an extra pair of shoes and a towel on a mat by the hose. I wash off the Sloggers, step on the mat to dry off, and then I'm ready for the next project. Try writing Sloggers, I'm certain they've been asked this question before. I hope this helps.
there is not much of a liner in the sole so yes my feet did sweat a little, but we had a very cool summer so I am not sure what it would have done in some real heat.
They are a bit rounded in the toe area. Maybe a bit more than regular tennis shoes. Not pointy, but not rounded, clog style neither.
Info with product suggested that half sizes should order up. I normally wear a 6 1/2 so I bought a 7 - - fits perfectly without being too loose or rubbing against my feet, yet there is easily room for a light sock.
It is a size 6 and B means medium width. Sloggers do not come in half sizes to my knowledge. The B (medium) width is roomy. Sloggers give you extra room to wiggle your toes, to wear a little thicker sock if needed.
Sorry, haven't had to clean the inside of mine yet, although I have worn them a lot and they are great! The insoles are removable, and I would try washing them by hand in cold water and air drying.
Although I have never shoveled while wearing Sloggers, I have to say, the sole is very durable and I am sure they are up for the task.
We think it would make a fine ditch bag. Its going to float some but thats going to depend on what you fill it with. The bag itself does not have any flotation built into it.
not that I can see there is no way to lock it up
I just measured mine and it is 29"x15"x12". I'm not sure it if was called an extra large, or just large, but these are it's actual measurement.
34 I believe. It's huge
Great bag but I doubt if SUBMERGED it would be waterproof.
We have x-large with 4-person tent, coleman 2-burner, coleman kitchen stand, 2 folding cheap walmart camp chairs, expensive alumnimun rollup table, and some other small things stuffed in it for the canoe. It seems like this would be a fairly big bag on the back of even the big Vulcan. The 110 liter has to be volume before it is closed, but it is still a fairly large bag. Probably better than hard bags for primitive camping if you can secure it however. Wish I could tell you more but haven't rode in decades.
Yes, and no. The bottom (black in the picture) is semi ridge and I would not attempt to fold in that area. Unpacked all the "green" folds into the black bottom. Guessing about 4"
Depends on the size, my 110L one is pretty huge but I did use it for a 7 week, cross country motorcycle journey. It's great for that!
There are buckles on the two ends that you roll down the top of the bag and buckle into (creates the waterproof seal, which works amazingly well on my boat bag), the D rings at the handles are multipurpose utility spots
I'm answering because previous answers were incorrect and new buyers will be misled. Description says X-Large is 14 x 34 x 15", and that matches the 110 liter capacity. Sizes given previously are for the much smaller 'Large' duffel, rated at 70 liters capacity. There are about 61 cubic inches in a liter, so this is easily confirmed.

10 " x 10 " x 22 "
It's too small for a helmet and/or shoulder pads, but could hold the rest.
Yes it does include a strap...
Each end has the big zip pocket like most duffel bags which you could keep a good size water bottle.
Yes it has about 1/4" pad covered on both sides
Yes
Yes. At least one basketball. Two would be a tight fit lengthwise.
Yep!
It's def not waterproof ! I just replaced mine with the Team Speed bag which is water proof. The inside silicone type lining shed off and was moldy. Do not buy if you put wet clothes in.
Yes if you wear the shoes on your feet. The bag cannot handle clothes for three days and shoes. If you need to take shoes buy the same bag in large instead.
Yes... My cleats easily fit into side pocket...
i'm heavier and taller than you and the extra large worked for me, so i'm guessing you might want a large. you definitely don't want tri shorts to be too big b/c they slow you down and be uncomfortable in the water and on the run. however, i can't recommend these shorts b/c i did not like the fit at all and ended up returning them. i use a one-piece for triathlon and it works for me. of course, these might work for you - the price is definitely nice! good luck.
i'm guessing L. i'm 5'8" and size 12 and i ordered an XL. they fit size-wise, but i didn't like the fit so i returned them. good luck!
I would suggest a Medium.
I am 5'4" and 115lb and wear a medium, but I like to size up in compression wear. I think a medium would fit you well.
Chlorine definitely decreases the life of these shorts, but that's the problem with chlorine! By rinsing them really well after use before washing them and air drying them, they will last longer.

There should be a size chart, but a men's size large is for a size 10 -13. I hope that this helps you.
1
Obviously it depends on your height, I'm 6'3" and they are mid-calf for me.
They are a bit thicker than a normal sock. Wouldn't so much say they are great for for winter.
I got medium and large. Medium fits, but is on the smaller size for a size 9 foot. Large fits perfect.
My Husband Wears A Size 10 Shoe So I Got Him A Large Size Sock. USA Size.
I've been wearing it as a cover over a down jacket, and my jacket has not been getting wet. I also wore it over a sweatshirt on a cruise ship in Glacier Bay. My camera got too wet to use again, but my sweatshirt stayed dry. I guess I should have used the jacket to cover the camera too.
Hi. I like this jacket...the hood does not come off, it is attached. But, the jacket is very light and packable, and the hood rolls down and secures with a velcro tab, like a rolled collar. I hope this helps.
Yes, it is VERY compact and thin. Balled up, it is the size of a large grapefruit at most.
It fits true to size, so just go by your shirt size.
Yes
POLYESTER
Below the waist, it also covers a jacket I wear underneath.
It will defiantly wrinkle of u scrunch it up. But it does in wrinkle after being hung for a while.
Two zippered pockets near the waist.
I bought a white one, it does have a hood. Love it.

The sweatshirt has not shrunk. I hang dry and have not put it in the dryer.
The black mossy oak infinity is the Mossy Oak official camo, and the black realtree is the official Real tree camo design. It just depends which brands exact camo design you like better. They are very similar. You can Google Realtree and Mossy Oak and see if you have a preference.
I believe the logo is stitched on at the boarder. Sorry, I'm not sure if that helps answer your question.
Yes on the hood and the sleeve.
It's stitched on. Its a really nice hoodie, bought it for my boyfriend last year, hasn't faded or beaded up or anything
I am 6'2 240 and a XXL is snug
I ordered this hoodie for my boyfriend, and he loves it. It is definitely a darker shade of green. From my understanding, the two options both labeled as "Rifle Green" just have a different pattern in the logo (one being from mossy oak, one from real tree). I hope I have helped!
I would say a large from my own personal experience. I typically wear a 2x but I ordered the 3x and it fit perfectly amd I do believe that had I ordered a 2x it would have been to small. I hope this helps. -jared
The one i received looks exactly like the pic
Sage green is a brighter green than rifle green.

When you purchase, simply leave a message to the seller staing what color and size you need. The Body Magic comes in black, beige, and white and in sizes 22-48. When a buyer buys from me, I automatically send a measuring chart to assist the buyer in determining the correct size.
Be careful ordering from some if these sights as I experienced fraud and ended up getting the garment from a local vendor instead. It was horrible
By your bra size
I am not the seller, so I really can not answer this question but I can say that I am familiar with the Ardyss Body Magic Product and the one I bought from this seller seemed to be the real McCoy and if it is not it really didn't matter because it certainly performed like one. It helped slim me down two dress sizes and it made me improve my posture.
Simply order and send a message to the seller on your color and size choice. Thank you.
Simply purchase then message the seller with your color and size choice.

Measured the one I have comes up 7 1/4 across 8 1/4 front to back with an inside depth of 6 1/4 just got the hats a few weeks back for my kids to wear. I tried on the hat it fits me just a tad snug on the front to back.
About 6 inches & I was very impressed on the quality of the hat.
It is stiff, and folding it would probably ruin the looks of it.
Yes
Depends. If I sit it back on my head it works but it's tight if I set it square on.
21 1/2 in - approx good quality
6 or 7 inches
Yes, I will make sure you receive a blue pair.
1 Pair. You may contact the seller to request a color or get which ever they decide to send.
You will have to contact the seller you purchased them from. Go to "Your Orders" and click on the item you want to send a request on. Good Luck

Hi Yes we have 12 blue ones. Sincerely, Toys & Gifts USA
Plastic but well made. Very cute. We used them in a Fashion Show. Judy
The one I purchased was for an adult...make sure you are ordering a child size.
I ordered 2 of the extra large, I found them to be true to size my son is 6' 2 " and they fit perfectly. He loved them... Don't forget the 2 toed foot socks and shoes... Hope this helps....
The height of the small would be ok, but it may be a bit tight. I'd recommend the next size up for you.
Size Small should be ok
adult small- adult medium would be more for 5-6+ 165lbs +
I own size XL and I'm 165lb. 5'9". So you might fit in the same one as me! Haha
It's on the screen when you place the order. It only comes in small, med., large and X large which is what I bought for my 6'2" son ...perfect fit..... If your not sure I recommend buying the larger size. ..that way you can take it in if it's a little big ...
Im 5'9 and 140 lbs. I got a Medium.
No, they do not, but they do have waist ties. I suppose, if you really needed them, loops could be added.
I'm about five and an xs fit well. I ould suggest a small or medium depending on if you want it to be tight or looser.

Hi There, You can use this over & over. I've cleaned about 20+ items so far - earrings, chains, rings and it's still working great.
If It is gold you do not need this, also I am sure this is not recommended for gold. It is great for silver. I clean my wifes gold by letting it soak in hot water with dish detergent. then scrub with an old tooth brush. the gold and diamonds sparkle after that.
Organic gemstones such as pearls, amber, coral, and ivory should not be cleaned in an ultrasonic cleaner or cleaned with an abrasive or ammonia based cleaner. Your emeralds and diamonds should be just fine if they are in a sturdy setting. A good discussion of the do's and don'ts of this topic, including your emeralds, is available at the site All About Gemstones, here: http://www.allaboutgemstones.com/jewelry_cleaning.html
No
Yes
I dont know how people could say it was the best. I have James Avery Silver and it made it a funky color and the odor was so bad even after I washes with soap and water. I followed the directions right from the canister and I just didn't like it.
No, it is the best cleaner i have ever used
That I don't know but I used it on silver plated jewelry
No I would not put pearls in there or in any other harsh cleaner. If there is no way you can clean it without getting it on the pearls I would take to a jeweler.
Hi Marie, I guess you can spray in the shoe first and place a shoe stretcher... however to give your shoe the "right" amount of stretch needed, it was recommended to spray and then wear on feet. I copied the directions for you from the can: Shake can well before using. Spray lightly inside the shoe where stretching is desired. Put on shoes and walk until they are dry. The shoes will stretch and soften while you walk. Do not wipe shoes while wet. If further stretching is desired, repeat the application. This is exactly how I used this spray... Hope this helped :)
The instructions on the can read "......developed to permanently stretch and soften shoes and gloves made of leather, suede or reptile skins. Not recommended for use on man made materials."
On the inside. I hope this helps.
Not easily...I turn the shoe upside down (keeping the aerosol can upright) and point toward the toes and just spray.
If u can find some material to push against that area, it should work. may be socks?
I received the mentioned can. When I went to use it the can appeared filled with fluid. However there was no propellant (gas) in the can to get out the fluid I tossed the can went to Shoe Carnival & bought leather stretcher in a pump spray which worked fine. I personally DO NOT think I would use these products on furry lined boots. A shoe shop might have a mechanical boot stretcher that would word better. Hopes this helps you out.
I guess
You spray this inside your shoes. As your foot warms in the shoe the shoe stretches for a more comfortable fit. You may need to do this each time you wear new or leather shoes until they feel comfortable. I would not use anything else. I also use this in my athletic shoes.
Yes. Spray your shoes and walk around the house for a few minutes. Repeat this once a day for a couple of days; it should work.
I only used it on my regular leather shoes. I never tried it on patent leather.
oh I got the small! If you want to layer or inseam is short I'd get medium
my son is 46 inches tall, we bought small it was right fit or bit short I think medium would be good, thinking large would be too big
I had the same problem and I went with the large now it will be a little bigger but if he plays with his costumes through the year I think it should be fine and the balloon on the abdomen part of the costume won't make it look extremely big...you can always order both sizes and return the other one I hope my information helps you
Small
I think medium size will fit him right
Last year my son was 50+ pounds and 50 inches tall and size M worked fine. It is in as good as new shape if you would like to buy it from me.
I bought this for my husband - he is normally an XL and this fit nicely. Not tight at all, and it didn't shrink. I think it might be too big if you go a size up.
No it does not. It washes and handles very well; an excellent buy.
Judging from the one I bought... my husband is a standard size XL, and this fit him just the way he like - fairly loose. He also has broad shoulders and (hopefully he won't see this) a little bit of a beer tummy as well. If the fit is standard for all sizes, I think you will like it. Good luck!
I weigh about 160 and ordered the xl, very comfortable
Definitely!
I am roughly the same size as you and a Medium will fit great when you first put them on (they do not shrink) however they become rather loose through out the day. If I were to buy another pair I would purchase the small.
small or meduim
XS for sure - I'm the same height as you and around 105lbs...the XS is a little bit big on me, though I think the height is perfect. I've found it stretches slightly with wear as well.
Wool comes from sheep. Marino wool comes from New Zealand if I'm not mistaken.
No
30 inches
The pairs I have are made in China....excellent quality...still fit and look good after almost 2 years of wash and wear.
I'd get the XS. I had to return the S because it was too big on my & we are about the same size.
I really don't know. I have only tried the midweight.
Not for me. 5'9", 155lbs, 13.5" neck circumference, wearing a medium. Neck perfectly comfortable.
7-8
I would probably order a small size. If it feels too large ( don't think it would) you can always return it.
After laundering and drying in dryer it measures 24" from shoulder to hem and 36" across chest. May have shrunk some but not a whole size. It is not a stretchy fabric. If you like a snugger fit I would be more inclined to go with the smaller size. Even before I purchased from Amazon, Minus 33 responded that their products are true to size. Medium is sizes 8-10 and large 12-14 according to their size chart. You will love this top. It is so warm and so worth the investment! I need to re-order while still in stock. Hope this was helpful.
For me, they are a relaxed true size. I ordered the size for my actual measurements and it's a soft fit. Not stretched tight anywhere. Just a smidge loose for maximal warmth.

No. These bracelets are two different widths. The ladies bracelet is thinner, at least the one I received is the thinner version. This picture could be just to show the difference between a mans and a ladies.
Yes. Four. One about patient has med condition, one patient has allergies. I can't recall what other two said except I think one was about Diabetes and one about Heart Condition-but not sure about those. There is plenty of room on face plate to have engraved if you wish additional info.Comes with paper card for wallet, also. Hope this helps. This is a VERY comfortable bracelet to wear on a 24 hr basis. Good Luck and hope this helps.
No
I received the bracelet in good time.It has a small area to put on info.It however opens up and stickers can be added to the inside .It was too small for my wife.I called the company and wanted to get it engraved.They informed me they did not engrave names on the bracelet. Upon checking with various sources,none could engrave the curved surface of the bracelet.If you want a name or information on the bracelet,be sure where you buy it that they will do the service.
7" but it stretches
I am not sure, I think it is possible
This item is not design to engrave your name but you could try to bring to the store to see if they can do it
I guess my answer would be "yes." However, in my particular case, I created my own DNR / body donation and transport / doctor information by printing it on paper, cutting it into two strips to fit inside, wrapping the paper strips in Scotch tape and inserting these inside the bracelet. When these strips get too wet, the ink on the paper "runs" and becomes less legible; so, periodically, I just print new strips, wrap them in tape and insert them in the bracelet. Bottom line, I'm VERY glad to have ordered this bracelet and have, indeed, ordered another one because I work on "projects" that have caused scratches on the surface and I want to have a nice "back-up" in my jewelry drawer. By the way, I took my bracelet to an engraver and had my name engraved on the outside surface so my identity is readily available.
I had mine done at Things Remembered at a mall.
yes it is..
I suppose that would depend on what kind of conditions you're skiing in. I've only skied here in Michigan, and I would be sweating in these. I would put these on the low end of "low to medium activity." Great for outdoor work like cutting wood where you're not really moving around a lot.
I use this as a base layer, it's soft enough and works well! :)
Their ability to repel odor depends entirely on your propensity to create odor. In other words, if you will be rather active on your camping trip, and you tend to sweat a lot as I do, these aren't going to do anything to help you smell better. If all I'm wearing them for is sleeping in, then I can wear them for several nights without a problem, but if I'm wearing them during the day while I'm outside and doing stuff, I'll wash them every day. If you will have access on your trip to a source of fresh water (even a flowing river or stream, if there's no running water), I would suggest getting a couple sets and washing one and hanging it out to dry while wearing the other.
It is smooth and don't affect pants.
I have a 34 inch waist and 36 inch inseam, and the Large/Tall fits me perfectly. They would still be comfortable even if I were a couple inches bigger in either direction.
I know I'm answering late, but I'm 6'3" about 200 lbs, 36" inseam, and the large tall fits me perfectly.
I wouldn't think these are what you are looking for
Inside were just fine, wouldn't want to wear inside for to long but short term just fine
I think you would be better off with a large. After washing mine shrank a little..
Medium
It has the usual split/overlap door
I think you are better off using the size chart given on the Coldpruf website to determine the size for you. Body dimensions (waist width and inseam length) rather than weight are more useful in figuring out the proper fit for clothes. For your convenience, here's the size chart from the Coldpruf website: http://www.coldpruf.com/public/uploads/charts/front/1351594991.q8bB.sizechart-mens.png
Add two or three inches to the length
Yes
i would suggest the size of his waist. I'm a 36/32 and I got a Xlarge and they fit me fine.
Absolutely, these are very light but still keep your legs very warm in cold temperatures...I wore them as a base layer in 20-60 degree weather.
How tall is your husband?I suggest you go for small because it fit me well. I'm 32inch waist and 170cm height. Hopefully it would be helpful for you. Have a nice day
Go to their website and they should have a place for questions and answers........Most times a large is 38 to 40 but saw one recently that listed large as 36 to 38.....usually the site has that on the product descripton also. .Hope this helps
Yep. I bought them for My Honey and he says the taglessness is much better. He finds the sprayed on label does NOT irritate his skin.
I have washed them several times with hardly any shrinkage,but i never put them in the dryer. I wear a 34/34 jean and i ordered medium tall, good fit.

Is about a waist 32, they fit small
Mi esposo usa normalmente talla 34 en pantalones y en este modelo lleva L, aprox 90-95cm cintura.Normalmente XXL es para un hombre con cintura entre 109-121cm, espero haberte ayudado.
It's accurate.
I am 5'6" tall. I am size small with 28" waist. Hope this helps. I did not like the bulky velcro strap.
Hi, I am also short, I am 5' 6" and 30 waist in US. The short fit good, I thought the front lid/tongue was a bit bulky. All in all the short is very comfortable. I hope I helped you.

Hi Lisa, I bought these glasses (Blue Blockers) a few yaers ago, both for myself and for my wife. Thses are designes as unisex and looks good on anyone. Remember, you should have glasses large enough to cover area around eyes to protect from the harmful UV rays of th sun, the skin under the eyes ai especially sensitive and pron to form wrinckles if not prperly protected. I say go ahhead and you will not regret.
No I have no idea why it says that, maybe it's the size of the box they come in. The temple arms are 5 inches and the lenses are 2.5 by 1.5. (I just measured them). They are the best sunglasses though. This is my 3rd pair in appx. 10 years. My husband won't use anything else to drive because of the clarity they provide.
Yes you did receive the wrong glasses, I ordered from one seller and got the wrong pair, he is listing wrong. But I ordered from a different seller a and got the right one. There's all kinds of new HD sunglasses the fold always, the aviators, the cristal (which is the pair I received,) But in my opinion the first one, (ultra) is the best. The glasses I got from this seller was right.
I don't know what "Blue Blocking Performance" means, however I can tell you I can see clearer whether I am in fog, rain, mist, and in general my vision is much better with the HD sunglasses on than off. My only complaint with these glasses is the plastic frame is very frail if the glasses are dropped further than two feet! I have broken many frames because of my own carelessness. I now wear a gadget that attaches to the end of the ear piece that keeps me from taking the glasses off and putting them in my shirt pocket. My tendency was to forget I had put the glasses in my shirt pocket...then bending over to do something and they fall out of the pocket onto the floor and the frame cracks! For $10 or so it's the best buy I have ever found in HD vision sunglasses.
Honestly, no they don't!
Yes they do. They work really well. Roger
Not that I have seen. They r the only ones I use anymore and always keep 2 to 3 pair extra in case I loose or break ones I am using. Have not seen a difference in lens color. If you buy the folding bow ones that r as seen on TV they r much darker and very uncomfortable.
you can still tell what the colors are but they do tint everything yellow !!
No more so than any regular sunglasses. So if you're thinking these would be great for anything faster than a bicycle, you'll be disappointed.
Not sure what you mean by "dark amber" but I don't think so.
About 3 Krispy Kremes a day.
Wear the size you do for a normal T-Shirt.. I'm 6' 4" and currently weigh in at 216 LB. So I wear an XL most of the time. I will say this, I ordered two, one in black and one in tan. The tan one came as a 3XL, which I was swimming in. It looked like I was wearing a tent, I told Amazon that it was too big and needed an XL. They emailed me back with a "Return Merchandise" shipping label and I received a credit back on my credit card. All handled very promptly. So if the size you order doesn't fit exactly right don't worry about the return.
I believe there isn't any difference. XXL is just another way of describing 2X.
It depends if he has wide shoulders and overall physical appearance. I am 5'6" medium built,160 Lbs..I wear a medium and it fit me just right. The sleeves are a bit baggy but remember this is not a tight fitting product. It should fit snug and comfortable. I hope this answer helps in your decision.Overall,i love it!!
I'd say get a small. I'm 5'10 and 220 and a large fit me just fine. I'd think a medium would be way too big for you.
I would say a med. I'm 6'0 197 athletic built with long arms. the med fit good around the torso area but the arms were two small. so in my opinion the med should be perfect for you. hope it fits good.
It seems to breathe really well, but I live up in the Sierra Nevada and it's always dry, even when it's hot. The sleeves are pretty loose. They come down to the middle of my wrist or so. But I think I've got the sleeves figured out. They've got a velcro tab, and can be worn up really easily. Like you just slide them up above your elbow and pin the velcro. It's a different fit. Not like a regular Under Armour long sleeve for running. Everything works, but the whole combo takes a little getting used to. Hope this helps.
They run true to size except the sleeves are short. Most have noted that one problem with these shirts. Also the re-enforcement on the elbows are to low. Hope this helps you.
Hi Howard, I would think a Large would work because it does shrink a bit, I wear xlarge 511 225 lbs, so as far as i know when i have ordered 5 now in total they ship large to me which is supposedly an XL. Good luck they are a nice comfortable shirt!
Haven't tried mine in the rain yet.

I would say a med. I'm 6'0 197 athletic built with long arms. the med fit good around the torso area but the arms were two small. so in my opinion the med should be perfect for you. hope it fits good.
It seems to breathe really well, but I live up in the Sierra Nevada and it's always dry, even when it's hot. The sleeves are pretty loose. They come down to the middle of my wrist or so. But I think I've got the sleeves figured out. They've got a velcro tab, and can be worn up really easily. Like you just slide them up above your elbow and pin the velcro. It's a different fit. Not like a regular Under Armour long sleeve for running. Everything works, but the whole combo takes a little getting used to. Hope this helps.
They run true to size except the sleeves are short. Most have noted that one problem with these shirts. Also the re-enforcement on the elbows are to low. Hope this helps you.
Hi Howard, I would think a Large would work because it does shrink a bit, I wear xlarge 511 225 lbs, so as far as i know when i have ordered 5 now in total they ship large to me which is supposedly an XL. Good luck they are a nice comfortable shirt!
Haven't tried mine in the rain yet.
I have 2 women's suits and 3 dresses in it and probably have room for more.
The front is completely see-thru. The sides and back are not.
It's 5 x 24 x 54 inches.
It's a bag worth buying , plenty of space and more than what I ecoected
I use the garment bag to store clothes between seasons. I think the zipper is decent quality for my use.
You'll have to check the product description at Amazon for materials details. I can tell you that it feels heavyweight to me, and I feel it definitely is a high quality product that I would buy again.
approximately 50" in length
It comes with the cedar slats. They are not really blocks, but rather thin sheets of wood that may or may not be cedar. The ones that came with my bag had no cedar smell.
yes it does have a small opening.. nothing to prevent months to get in there.. but frankly if your clothes are clean, dry and stored well.. hopefully they will find somewhere else to go.
Yeah there's a slit at the top to let the hangers out, bugs could easily get in but it's got a cedar block in the back to discourage moths and bugs. I expect there's some sort of spray or something you could use around the area to keep bugs out though. Apart from that it is sealed, hope this helps
Yes. But it would be tight. Count on 10 shirts
The dimensions are 24" wide x 5" deep x 42" high.
Not clear! but a good time for memory improvement; or stick a posit note on front with items within!!!!!! Last resort, open bag and LOOK! A good bag!!!!!!
No
It will... But not 'cleanly'. It is definitely not made for folding if that helps.
I did NOT use it for Fur storage... but I think it would work... it is a high quality cloth - with only one panel being plastic bag - thus there is no humidity build up
Nope.
I haven't stored them in the basement but I don't see why it wouldn't work. Bill
No, not really. There is a very small piece of Cedar in the bag for protection...but the scent doesn't invade the clothes. Perhaps, when the bag is opened after a time there is a mild scent...but not noticeable on the clothes when I wear them...Hope that helps.
I have a 13 inch macbook air that I carry in this bag. I slip it into the padded section in the back, without a case and it works well for me...
Absolutely! It's got a bunch of handy pockets. I love mine so much! Best thing I've ever bought!
Yes. I ride a bus and I walk down the isle without knocking someone in the head.
Hi John. I think you are looking for an M or a L. Definitely not the S...I got the M and I am pretty happy as I can carry a lot of stuff (sneakers included). Of course it will depend on how big your sneakers are...there are videos on Youtube you can watch about these bags and diff sizes. Hope this helped.
No, but my standard sized bottle fits upright in the bag.
The fabric is waterproof. But the flap does not prevent water and snow from coming in, This is very very disappointing to me. What good is waterproof if there are huge gaps that render my cellphone vulnerable to water. Vey disappointed, would also help lots to have outside pocket and deeper pockets in general.
Yes. My 11" macbook air just barely fits. I'd go large for a 16.5
It's the XS.
you can see the size differences on timbuk2.com they have photos of each bag in each size carried by different people. They tell you how tall each person is carrying the bag. there is a difference between M and L, Large is pretty big..
No! Very comfortable especially if you wear it across your body vs over one shoulder but either way you'll be fine!

yes it does; you will find it very useful
Not as designed. What I did as I had a similar problem. I drilled holes in the top of the stretcher to accept the "bunion" plugs in the area wanted. Worked great!!
It doesn't seem to stretch out the toe area much at all.
The foot section is wood, the part you screw to make heel adjustments is plastic, the part you screw to widen the forefoot is made of metal.
I couldn't get them to expand very much at all. I have open toed shoes too, and tried to stretch the area at the base of my toes. The stretcher wouldn't even expand enough to touch that part of the shoe...didn't work for me at all.
They came as a pair. Very nicely made.
2 it's a set for a pair of shoes to be stretched at the same time.
2 stretchers
Those are great help for all my shoes. Ti would say it goes quite wide. You will be really happy!
As I recall, each "foot" came with about 4 or 5 nodes, of various shapes; some oval-ish, some more round.
Sizing seemed pretty true to me; however, If you have large, muscular calves or a thick ankle- skip it! The boot gets quite narrow at the bottom and my son has a very difficult time getting his feet in and out of the boot.
I wear size 10 and a half shoes. The size 11 boots were way too big. The size 10 worked for me.
No. not a steel toes shoe ... what I get is not the same shoe in the pic send me is a CLC band
About 15 and a half inches from the ground
They are not light weight but sturdy.
A women's size 10 is equivalent to an 8.5 to 9 men's size.
They are not the boots pictured but the ones I got suffice for using them to spray herbicide and chemicals which is what I was after. The ankle is tight but the sizing was about right I did get one size bigger but I wear fairly thick socks so the are a little looses but not bad enough for me to go down a size with normal socks maybe. Again the boots that were sent to me were not the ones pictured here.
I'm a 10.5 and I bought an 11. They are a little big but it makes it easy for quick on and off.
Don't know!
I would try a 9.5, if they have 1/2 sizes. If not, I would try the 9 first before the 10. Returns were easy. Good luck!!
Yes...I bought them for my husband (half size smaller than he usually wears) and they fit perfectly
ClC They are pretty good boot's, I cut mine at the line halfway up the boot, Because they were way too long.
No fabric liner, but easy to slip on. Alot of space around the calves too for tucking in pants.
I'm fairly short, about 5'7'', and the boots go up just below knees. The calf portion is fairly wide, as I didn't have any problems stuffing my pants into the boots. However, the boots fit quite wide if you don't intend to wear shoes with them. I'm an 8D and the boots are quite loose without shoes. I would go down a size if wearing boots without shoes.
The pair.
Runs about 1 size bigger, from my normal size.
The boot is a heavy rubber material with a fabric lining.
The boot are 15" high, and that's why I purchased them. I was fishing on a 58 foot fishing boat.
About 2/3 of the way up between your foot and your knee.
You can enter the up to 3 initials to be engraved in the gift message section during checkout.
The battery is easily replaceable. It is worth noting that the watch opens to a 90 degree angle, not 180, so that the time is inconveniently seen when the watch is placed on a surface. It is, of course, easily seen when held.
I would assume it is stainless steel as it is not magnetic
The product description says it is included.
Message the seller with the engraving information.
I would trust it against spider bites, but not against snake bites. Although, I've never used the suit for either application, only with bees.
No, I just looked and it is made in Pakistan. Hope that helps.
No, the hood has some stiffness to it to keep its shape. The mesh is integrated with the hood and the mesh stays several inches from the face.
This was purchased as a gift for someone, and I cannot answer, sorry!

yes perfectly..
Yes, is a Sturdy item.
I have not used this on silver. Only platinum and white gold. Some reviews have said that it was harsh on their silver. I would use caution and read their reviews first before attempting to use it.
Have not used on brass but have used on silver, gold, stainless steel and has worked well but you do need to soak jewelry for a good clean.
Not sure, it works good on silver but does not get a real deep clean on certain items. I may not be leaving it to soak long enough or the chemicals may not be strong enough in my bottle.
No
This comes in a 6x7oz Packs and is the liquid formula. Please consider This That & WhatNots for your purchase
It'll get rid of a lot of it, but you'll probably need to use the small brush that comes with it to clean out the small crevices. May need a couple of treatment dunking sessions.
Yes, the only things not to clean are: coral, ivory, amber, malachite, pearls, opals, jade or turquoise. Those are porous and should not be cleaned with Weiman's. You'll get the jar, which has a round tray which sits on the bottom and has a long 'stem' to pick it up and swirl inside the jar. There's a small bristle brush to clean areas where dirt would hide. It does a great job on jewelry. Basically, rinse your jewelry off, place in the tray, place in the jar, cover, and leave for 1/2 hr. Then, remove cover, swirl the handle, brush if necessary, rinse in warm water and place on a soft cotton towel to dry. You will notice a difference! Hope this helps.
Yes. You can use this on fine jewelry, metal and gemstones. Great on gold, platinum, titanium and gemstones including diamond, ruby, emerald and sapphire. Not for use on softer stones such as coral, ivory, amber, malachite, pearls, opal, jade or turquoise. After you open the lid, grab the tip of the basket post and let soak in the basket for 1/2 hour. Use the included brush for heaver dirt. Rinse w/ cool water, and let dry on a towel. It does great job for our jewelry.
I see absolutely no reason stainless steel jewelry can't be cleaned in it. If the jewelry has "soft" stones (i.e., pearls) than of course not. Stainless steel can be cleaned by just plain soap of some kind. Or, try a polishing cloth.
I think so. It says it is for semi precious stones. Not for coral, ivory,, amber, malachite, pearls, opals, jade or turquoise Those are all softer stones. I think aquamarine is a semi precious stone. Good luck.
It depends on his/her weight. My baby is 1 year old and weights 26 lbs. I first bought him the L (22-28 lbs), but it was too tight so I exchanged it for an XL (28-33) and it fits him perfectly. I would recommend buying a size higher than the range stated in the product. it's a very good product and easy to clean!!!.... I hope it helps! :)
I had baby swim trunks, so I wore them over this swim diaper. But a bathing suit isn't needed. Without the trunks, he would have just been sporting the baby *speedo* look. :) I put it in the wash with the rest of the baby clothes, but then hung it up to dry.
Yes I would go up a size they fit snug. As they should !! You dont want things leaking out :)
I would get the XL. My son is 31lb, supposed to get a XL, I got the XXL instead. It's a perfect fit.
100% polyester and liner 100% nylon
I don't think it would work very well. They fit pretty snug. Also I'm not sure going a size bigger would work as there may be gaps around the legs, if your concern is to hide the diaper.
wash like you would a cloth diaper. use a diaper sprayer/bidet to hose it off or just dunk it in the toilet to rinse it off and put it in the regular wash. just make sure to wash your hands really well :)
I would guess yes to the 3T because it sounds like he will have a disposable diaper under. My son is almost 40lbs and the 3T fits well.
The height for the XL size is about 7 inches. My son is about 34 1/2 inches tall, 29 pounds, and wears a size 4 diaper. The XL size fits him well. Hope that helps!
These aren't absorbent like the Huggies or similar brand swim diapers, so pee will soak thru. But, they are better about catching poop. The swim school my child attends requires that kids wear two of this type swim diaper when he goes to his lessons. We haven't had any problems with this method.

My daughter is 21 months, weighs 21 lbs and wears mostly 12-18 month clothes and I bought her a large. It fit snugly around her thighs. I hope that helps!
My daughter is 13mo and is 32 inches and 22lbs and we had to get her x-large (says 28-33lbs on size chart). The 4t looks like it goes up to 45 but i found this brand runs small. Buy and try i guess.
I bought this when my daughter was around 6 months and she was skinny. I found the leg holes on this diaper to be too big for her skinny legs. If your daughter has thin legs, she may have the same issue.
The medium is for 15-22lbs and the openings are snug so I would probably just get the medium because she will probably grow out of a small pretty fast.
I would think so
No. http://www.finisinc.com/download-content/charts/swim_diaper_sizing.jpg
I wouldn't. they are designed to hold in poop but the fabric gets wet and the disposable diaper would get wet.

These are swim diapers sized for toddlers, not older children.

It depends on his/her weight. My baby is 1 year old and weights 26 lbs. I first bought him the L (22-28 lbs), but it was too tight so I exchanged it for an XL (28-33) and it fits him perfectly. I would recommend buying a size higher than the range stated in the product. it's a very good product and easy to clean!!!.... I hope it helps! :)
I had baby swim trunks, so I wore them over this swim diaper. But a bathing suit isn't needed. Without the trunks, he would have just been sporting the baby *speedo* look. :) I put it in the wash with the rest of the baby clothes, but then hung it up to dry.
Yes I would go up a size they fit snug. As they should !! You dont want things leaking out :)
I would get the XL. My son is 31lb, supposed to get a XL, I got the XXL instead. It's a perfect fit.
100% polyester and liner 100% nylon
I don't think it would work very well. They fit pretty snug. Also I'm not sure going a size bigger would work as there may be gaps around the legs, if your concern is to hide the diaper.
wash like you would a cloth diaper. use a diaper sprayer/bidet to hose it off or just dunk it in the toilet to rinse it off and put it in the regular wash. just make sure to wash your hands really well :)
I would guess yes to the 3T because it sounds like he will have a disposable diaper under. My son is almost 40lbs and the 3T fits well.
The height for the XL size is about 7 inches. My son is about 34 1/2 inches tall, 29 pounds, and wears a size 4 diaper. The XL size fits him well. Hope that helps!

12 pair
They are 100 percent cotten and the interior is similar to terry cloth but a little lighter. Very comfortable.
Not really. My husband wears these over his compression socks and actually wears two pairs so that they stay up. They are a good buy for the $$. They are not too tight at the top which has always been a problem for him.
no, mine did not shrink in the dryer. hope this helps. I do suggest to wash them in warm water , not hot water.
In the USA we still use inches to measure length;Whereas, in Europe uses the metric. So, comparable in shoe size means same in length and width.
No
About mid-calf
They look like regular socks and don't leave indentations. They're very very soft with a LOT of give to them.
You can go to my store and take a look picture. It is little bit higher than ankle. Thank you
According to the description (I threw away the wrappers)m they are 85% cotton, 15% poly and spandex. They are a crew sock
No. You wind it up.
It plays Somewhere Over the Rainbow.
over the rainbow. it was a gift for my grandaughter and she said she loves it.
I have it and it does play Over the Rainbow
Hi Jason, My specs fog up too. I've done all my mototcycling in Europe and America wearing glasses and it's the one and only thing that bugs me about the thing I do most for fun (in public) All previous balaclavas, when worn covering my nose have simply exacerbated the problem and no amount of anti-fog treatment of my lenses or visor would help very much. The CTR Chinook has a panel in the nose/mouth area that helps enorrmously and whilst it's not perfect it does make a huge difference. When moving your misting problem will likely be minimal but at stops you'd normally be frantically lifting the visor or poking around with a gloved finger in an effort to create a small clear window. With the chinook I've found that pursing my lips at stops, so that they actually come into contact with the mesh panel, whilst lifting the visor results in almost zero spectacles misting. Like I said. It's by no means perfeect but on cold rides I often find myself wishing I'd found and purchased something similar years ago. Frankly it's a mystery why motorcycle clothing manufacturers don't pay more attention to the snow mobile sector. Hope this helps.
I've never had this happen, and I've used it at temperatures below zero. But, I suppose it depends. If you're using it in the Arctic or Antarctic, then it probably would freeze some what. I bet if you're not out too long it would work at temperatures around -10C to -15C for a long time. Colder than that, and it might begin to freeze over a bit. I would check out the manufacturer's specifications and make sure that whatever temperature you plan to use it in is within the spec range.
Yea it will... I wear it under my full face motorcycle helmet... And those have the right cheek pads too... Its about as thick as... Idk like the cuff of a hoodie.. Like a WalMart hoodie not a super thick one... It'll be fine :)
In the case of this head gear, the vast majority of your head is covered with the exception of your eyes. It's all a matter of not keeping the cold out, but keeping your body heat in and this product does just that. This is the only balaclava I've ever owned, and I'm satisfied having worn it during snowstorms and wind chills in the teens but not feeling cold. Perhaps you should ask others about lower temperatures as Pete said because I haven't tried it during single digit weather as you've described it. We don't often get that cold in Maryland, but we do have our moments. Final point, the fact that you can adjust it to wear the head sock multiple ways makes it highly versatile for all cold-weather needs.
It's flexible. I wear in-ear buds with it. It fits nice and snug. I really enjoy this mask.
No. Fits too snug. Maybe over it.
No, they're connected in the back.
To be honest I don't know but all I can tell you are my experiences with this particular face mask. It covers my face well and it even has a ventilated mesh like area around your mouth that can get wet from moisture from heavy breathing sometimes but it doesn't happen to me often. This one comes down around the neck like a cowl that you can tuck in under your shirt and I readjust the face area sometimes in front of a mirror because I'm obsessive compulsive with making it line up right lol You can also pull down the mouth area in case you go inside a public place so you don't put people on edge which I forget to do sometimes considering it does conceal my entire face except for my eyes.
The head and neck is fleece the only part that is wind proof is the face , not sure what it's made of but its firmer than the rest . I ordered the large and its big on me . Hope this helps .
Yes
Really good. I wore this on a climb on Mount Kilimanjaro and on summit night it was freezing and windy but it kept my face so warm! The only complaint is that it felt a bit tight around my nose so at times it was hard to breathe (though hard to tell if it's the balaclava or the high altitude I was at).
There's plenty of material to tuck in & keep the chi;; out!
My hat size is 7 1/4 and I got a medium. If you wear a large helmet I would get a large
it's big. i have a big head and mine is pretty loose, but it's adjustable so it's all good.
If you have regular access to a washing machine, yes. Yes indeed.
Hello , I bought this in junior size for my 7 year old boy . He is 9 years old now and has outgrown it . He is of Normal size for his age . I think a teenager of 15 could wear one size fis all for an adult
it fits over head and cover nose and most of mouth
I don't know about the size compared to a junior, I wear a 7 1/4 hat and the medium fits me well, not to tight not to loose. True to size.
I wear an extra small helmet (21 1/2 inches head size) so I ordered a size S/M and it fits very nice.
Yes, it covers your nose if you want
I emailed the company and received the following reply: If you measure the circumference of your head just below the nose, junior would be 18-22 inches, S/M would be 20-24, and L/Xl would be 22-26.
40 mph at 29@ in a side by side felt like I was in a cozy chair at home.
yea the howler is better for coverage and comfort. I have both and I would rather go with the howler
When laid flat out it's about 10 inches wide. The widest part of my head is about 22 inches and it fits very nicely, definitely some extra stretch and could easily fit +/- 1 inch or so comfortably, and that's for a L/XL.
This one over laps, and the other is just a hole. With this one I just wear the bottom half, somewhat like a scarf, while the other half rests on the back of my head.
I'd go with the junior size.
I haven't actually been exposed to a downpour, but I have worn on on a dock during a very misty day.. it does fairly well. I never felt like it was wet or damp and it continued to provide the same wind resistance. I don't think that it would work well in a direct downpour.
Go with the next size up. That s/m is too tight for me, and I am 5'5" at 165.
I have a massive head and I got the L/XL and I can still wear earbuds under it very comfortably.
Yes

This one over laps, and the other is just a hole. With this one I just wear the bottom half, somewhat like a scarf, while the other half rests on the back of my head.
I'd go with the junior size.
I haven't actually been exposed to a downpour, but I have worn on on a dock during a very misty day.. it does fairly well. I never felt like it was wet or damp and it continued to provide the same wind resistance. I don't think that it would work well in a direct downpour.
Go with the next size up. That s/m is too tight for me, and I am 5'5" at 165.
I have a massive head and I got the L/XL and I can still wear earbuds under it very comfortably.
Yes
Hi Jason, My specs fog up too. I've done all my mototcycling in Europe and America wearing glasses and it's the one and only thing that bugs me about the thing I do most for fun (in public) All previous balaclavas, when worn covering my nose have simply exacerbated the problem and no amount of anti-fog treatment of my lenses or visor would help very much. The CTR Chinook has a panel in the nose/mouth area that helps enorrmously and whilst it's not perfect it does make a huge difference. When moving your misting problem will likely be minimal but at stops you'd normally be frantically lifting the visor or poking around with a gloved finger in an effort to create a small clear window. With the chinook I've found that pursing my lips at stops, so that they actually come into contact with the mesh panel, whilst lifting the visor results in almost zero spectacles misting. Like I said. It's by no means perfeect but on cold rides I often find myself wishing I'd found and purchased something similar years ago. Frankly it's a mystery why motorcycle clothing manufacturers don't pay more attention to the snow mobile sector. Hope this helps.
I've never had this happen, and I've used it at temperatures below zero. But, I suppose it depends. If you're using it in the Arctic or Antarctic, then it probably would freeze some what. I bet if you're not out too long it would work at temperatures around -10C to -15C for a long time. Colder than that, and it might begin to freeze over a bit. I would check out the manufacturer's specifications and make sure that whatever temperature you plan to use it in is within the spec range.
Yea it will... I wear it under my full face motorcycle helmet... And those have the right cheek pads too... Its about as thick as... Idk like the cuff of a hoodie.. Like a WalMart hoodie not a super thick one... It'll be fine :)
In the case of this head gear, the vast majority of your head is covered with the exception of your eyes. It's all a matter of not keeping the cold out, but keeping your body heat in and this product does just that. This is the only balaclava I've ever owned, and I'm satisfied having worn it during snowstorms and wind chills in the teens but not feeling cold. Perhaps you should ask others about lower temperatures as Pete said because I haven't tried it during single digit weather as you've described it. We don't often get that cold in Maryland, but we do have our moments. Final point, the fact that you can adjust it to wear the head sock multiple ways makes it highly versatile for all cold-weather needs.
It's flexible. I wear in-ear buds with it. It fits nice and snug. I really enjoy this mask.
No. Fits too snug. Maybe over it.
No, they're connected in the back.
To be honest I don't know but all I can tell you are my experiences with this particular face mask. It covers my face well and it even has a ventilated mesh like area around your mouth that can get wet from moisture from heavy breathing sometimes but it doesn't happen to me often. This one comes down around the neck like a cowl that you can tuck in under your shirt and I readjust the face area sometimes in front of a mirror because I'm obsessive compulsive with making it line up right lol You can also pull down the mouth area in case you go inside a public place so you don't put people on edge which I forget to do sometimes considering it does conceal my entire face except for my eyes.
The head and neck is fleece the only part that is wind proof is the face , not sure what it's made of but its firmer than the rest . I ordered the large and its big on me . Hope this helps .
Yes
Really good. I wore this on a climb on Mount Kilimanjaro and on summit night it was freezing and windy but it kept my face so warm! The only complaint is that it felt a bit tight around my nose so at times it was hard to breathe (though hard to tell if it's the balaclava or the high altitude I was at).
There's plenty of material to tuck in & keep the chi;; out!
My hat size is 7 1/4 and I got a medium. If you wear a large helmet I would get a large
it's big. i have a big head and mine is pretty loose, but it's adjustable so it's all good.
If you have regular access to a washing machine, yes. Yes indeed.
Hello , I bought this in junior size for my 7 year old boy . He is 9 years old now and has outgrown it . He is of Normal size for his age . I think a teenager of 15 could wear one size fis all for an adult
it fits over head and cover nose and most of mouth
I don't know about the size compared to a junior, I wear a 7 1/4 hat and the medium fits me well, not to tight not to loose. True to size.
I wear an extra small helmet (21 1/2 inches head size) so I ordered a size S/M and it fits very nice.
Yes, it covers your nose if you want
I emailed the company and received the following reply: If you measure the circumference of your head just below the nose, junior would be 18-22 inches, S/M would be 20-24, and L/Xl would be 22-26.
40 mph at 29@ in a side by side felt like I was in a cozy chair at home.
yea the howler is better for coverage and comfort. I have both and I would rather go with the howler

No...if you look close, there will be an area for a very small tool to pry open, or put pressure on and unscrew. Hope this helps
That's what I used it on, and yes - an old SMALL woman's model. The three points are loose. It took a couple minutes to get the hang of it, then "piece of cake."
The twin post at the end open to approx 1 3/8" and the bottom post approx 1 1/2". I found that I did not have a watch that it could not be adjusted to fit. I have one that is classified as a men's extra large face.
This works for most watches. If it does not work, we offer a 30 day return policy.
You need to place it in position and push it in for it to say.
This tool is adjustable and works with many brands of wrist watches that I own. It comes with different pieces that matches several watches. I would try it. Still cheaper than paying $$ to watch repairers to change your bartery. Hopefully this helps.
Place the watch Face down, on the back of the watches outer edge you will see several cut indentation. Line up the tools points to fit the indentation(points are in separate little box, these points fit into the cylinders on tool, adjust by turning wheel and handle to fit indentations)Turn left to loosen and right to tighten, while pressing down.
Yes, I would imagine so. We got the device to use on my wife's small fashion watch (just barely fit though) so I would think that it would easily fit on a small dive watch.
I bought this to remove the back from a Seiko watch. It adjusted to fit the "grooves", but the tool itself was so flimsy it would "slip off" - causing the inserts to scratch the back of the watch. I never got the back off! So, if you want to try it, be careful!
2 5/16 inches
Only a very thin one would fit I just used old key rings .. even a very thin bedded chain for my dog tags didn't fit
I don't own the other set, but I think they are different except for the Kingdom Key. I'm not clearly sure
Honestly, I can't answer that. I'm just as confused as you. My first box was magnetic, and had just regular Sora from KH2 instead holloween town Sora. I don't know why they changed the box.
Yes mine did and in very good condition
Well I tried sticking them to magnets and they won't stick, so I'm assuming it is a non-ferrous metal. They all have a little weight to them, so they won't break easily, its probably stainless steel. "Generally, magnets stick to materials made out of iron, nickel, or cobalt. These materials are called ferromagnetic materials. Ferromagnetic materials have a special structure. A magnet can change the direction of the magnetic forces of the atoms in these materials". I hope I answered your question.
you can add a jump ring onto them which is what i did, but they will fit a standard chain, like one with the balls. or just a regular necklace chain.
It's just the key set. There is no chain. I bought them and found a chain that fits most of them. Some of them do have smaller holes for the chain though, so oths best to find a thin chain. I love mine. I always get compliments from gamers at my school. :)
No it does not.
I gave it as a birthday present, but my cousin put one on his key chain, and wore another as a necklace. Hope this helps!
I'm not quite sure about the metal pieces because I didn't really end up using those. The crystals themselves don't have lead.
It id 36" long and it is so beautiful that it is beyond words. I purchased the aurora borelis and it is beyond words to say how fab it really is. I hope that you will think it is a fabulous as I do. PAR
I dont know.. sorry. But they are sturdy and look like real crystalson my chandelier... Good Luck
Hi Debbie, I used them to drape them from a Ballard Designs Petite Clair chandelier in my daughter's room and I was satisfied with them. I am not a good judge of length, but they were barely long enough to just drape across the arms. Hope this helps!

yes it is very packable. It folds down almost totally flat then you just pull it out and put it on your head to reshape it. Sometimes you need to reshape it a little by hand but if you pack it flat there is generally no reshaping required. I have packed mine for trips to Africa, Europe, and various trips here in the states.
Go to the Tilley website, they have very clear instructions on measuring for the proper fit.
www.tilley.com/us_en/how-to-fit/
I would call Tilley in Canada and explain your issue. I believe they can suggest a way to remove the deep crease. Otherwise, it's a outstanding out of doors hat!
No but I don't remember it being folded?
No adjust on the inside. I ordered an 1/8 up size to be sure mine fit with all my hair tucked in. Hope this helps a bit.
I have never experienced brim flop with my Tilley, whether walking in strong winds in town or on a ridge.
In mid to high winds yes,
Front and back both measure 3 inches. The sides are just under 2 1/4 inches.
59 or 60 cm would be very comfortable. They have a chin cord, so will never blow off

No unfortunately these are preset assortment colors.
When I ordered they said it was random colors and that I wouldnt know which were sent to me. So they are really cute but didnt know what colors ahead of time
I really want to order these but I really want a black, fuschia, pink, red, blue, white. is that at all possible?
Yes it is Medium
Good question. I see the same disparity. On the one hand, the description lists the model number as 1230364, which is the the number on the tag on the 6" boxers I already own. On the other hand, that same description reads "9 inch inseam" a little higher up. You could roll the dice, but I'd rather not have to try and explain all this to a CSR, and deal with the RMA.
They run small. Buy one size larger than you normally due. I don't like them because they do not support the testicles, etc. properly. The pouch is not wide enough and not curve properly like the original of several years ago. I will not buy any more.
using normal underwear briefs as 38 to 40 would a large in Under Armour
Extra large but if you have huskie upper legs or a large rear those are the areas that these run a little small I am 44 waist I get XXL nod they fit perfectly
is small
I wash in "eco-warm" which is a setting just between cold and warm on my front loader. I dry on a line, because they dry so quickly and I don't want to shrink them. I used to wash in cold, but I started to notice that they didn't smell the best afterwards. Now that I use "eco-warm" I haven't noticed any foul odors.
Yes they do!
Yeah I asked why is there boxerjocks. I guess they sale both.
They are a great quality set of underwear. They do feel snug to me and don't loose the stretch. I would try a set.

On the other hand, that same description reads "9 inch inseam" a little higher up. You could roll the dice, but I'd rather not have to try and explain all this to a CSR, and deal with the RMA.
They run small. Buy one size larger than you normally due. I don't like them because they do not support the testicles, etc. properly. The pouch is not wide enough and not curve properly like the original of several years ago. I will not buy any more.
using normal underwear briefs as 38 to 40 would a large in Under Armour
Extra large but if you have huskie upper legs or a large rear those are the areas that these run a little small I am 44 waist I get XXL nod they fit perfectly
is small
I wash in "eco-warm" which is a setting just between cold and warm on my front loader. I dry on a line, because they dry so quickly and I don't want to shrink them. I used to wash in cold, but I started to notice that they didn't smell the best afterwards. Now that I use "eco-warm" I haven't noticed any foul odors.
Yes they do!
Yeah I asked why is there boxerjocks. I guess they sale both.
They are a great quality set of underwear. They do feel snug to me and don't loose the stretch. I would try a set.

I usually wear 33x32 pants and Large is perfect. Not tight around the waist, and legs are 1/16" above the ground. They do have an adjustable drawstring, so sizes should be somewhat flexible!
Hi, Mine are size large. The top to the bottom along the leg is 43". The inseam is 30"
They ARE fairly bulky, but they would work. You would likely feel a lot of rubbing. I would use some sort of strap on the chain side to prevent catching (rain pants for biking come with a sewn in strap). I personally would carry them with me just in case there is a surprise shower. I'm not sure though that I would find them comfortable for a long ride.
29 inches
elastic waist with drawstring. Relaxed about 41, fully stretched tight about 48"

Sorry, no zipper fly.
A large should fix. I bought a x large and the pants were about inch two long. I am 6'

This warm up set is not one that will make him sweat. It's for comfort.
I am also 5'11", 240 with a 42 waist. The pants were slightly long but not uncomfortably long causing tripping, etc. I got the XL. Hope this helps.
XXL the pants will be about three inches too long. This is a very nice warm up suit hope this helps
No there are no zippers. It just looks that way.
I'm exactly the same and the XL fits perfect. Awesome set
My husband has a xl it fits him perfect he is 6'3" 280 lbs the large fits up to about 175 lbs xxl over 300 lbs

Yes, this comes with the watch, the transmitter, and the chest strap
I swim under water (one way) and back on top the length of an Olympic size pool for approximately an hour with the monitor on and have not had a problem.
The hare rate sensor's battery. Is easy to replace. I am not sure about the monitor's.
The first battery in the transmitter didn't last long. But the second is lasting months longer with no Sogn of weakening.
Yes...you do not have to wait
Have you tried replacing the battery in the chest strap monitor?
You don't need to do a complete reset of the device. The user manual will guide you by navigating through the setup menu and perform the necessary changes / adjustments.
I don't know. I ordered the men's version and received the men's version but they keep wanting me to review and answer questions about the women's version. I wish they would get the version I bought correctly.
Yes, it does a good job. To get the most accurate reading, I suggest you get the new and improved chest strap as sold on the Amazon site. Is well worth the $18.
Yes it comes with a chest strap that monitors your heart rate on your watch. When I am on the treadmill my heart rate shows up on the treadmill monitor also. V
It is quite strong and will survive in city speeds, but probably not highway speeds.
This rain suit is light duty, not good for construction. May I suggest Helly Hanson or something by Bass Pro Shops. Alaskan fishermen and harsh weather researchers I've known use Helly Hanson.
Would be easy to put in a back pack. Nice suit.
The item I brought was for my husband. He has a 40 waist and 32 height. The pants fit snug on him but the length was good.

My husband is 5'10, 175ish lbs, jeans are 32x34. He also wears it over his jeans and tshirt. We ordered him a size L and it fits great. Hope this helps, I would probably order a L if I were you. Sorry for the late reply, just got it tonight.
Hi Juan...I ordered a large for a man in my life. He is about 5'9...185 lbs. He wears this over his clothes and a light hoodie jacket if need be. I hope this helps somewhat.
I wear a 38x32 and i bought x-large and it fits perfectly
I do believe a medium will fit you and you should have room to move around.
I believe the material is of good quality. Not the heaviest gauge, but shouldn't tear too easily.
It's been a while, Al, but I seem to recall no unusual sizing issues. I sent it back, however, because it was too heavy for backpacking. If you're planning on standing in one place (on a boat or something,) this would be the ticket. I'm going to guess it'd be a medium?
fully nylon lined
I would think not. The suit is bulky, and probably not too comfortable during a golf swing. But I must say that I am not a golfer. I use the suit when I pressure wash the house.
In reality nothing last forever. I'm planing to used a couple times and discarted..yes PVC not only crack but tend to get cold that how lose it flexibility and cracks using it with nylon looks more stronger.. But we see if pass the text.

I do not carry a stove in it. I have a separate bag for our stove. However I do carry the griddle in the bottom part . A stove would not fit there. I use the bag for all the cookware, plates cups ect
We have camped in some decent rain storms, and the bag did very well!!
I imagine you could find a piece of luggage that would work well also. We probably got stuck on the notion that this is made for camping! A piece of luggage might actually have more durable sides. This does, however, have a compartment on the bottom of the bag. We use it for the camp stove. I would say just lay out whatever you think you'll need, then go from there. We have two of these bags for all our tent-camping gear. If you are packing in the trunk of your car, you could probably also use plastic totes. I wouldn't say this is the "be all end all" answer, but it is nice, and we like/use it.
Soft no reinforcement
Unfortunately I have not purchased the stove yet but I have been able to fill up the bag with all of my other camping equipment well
Mine ran very loose at a size large , i would go at least medium. Although these shirts are very thin and don't provide much compression at all so beware
in my opinion no it may ride up when extremely wet its more of a dry sport or workout compression shirt
I'm 2 inches taller than you and 44 pounds heavier, and a large fits me nicely. I'd suggest you go with a medium.
It is too thin and doesn't fit tight enough to provide enough compression to help with sweating try another brand like champion or under armour
No I don't believe it compresses that well but it's a good fit if you get your size correctly
I'd recommend the extra large.
I'd say go with the large they fit pretty snug
Hi Visal..if u want it tight and fit go for the medium..I am assuming from ur weight that ur not that bulky..so medium shall do well..however if u have a big stomach or belly watch out..this will frame it..maybe u will have to go for L..if u dont have..then M is fine
I don't know to compare. But, I'm 260lbs, 44 chest, 6'1" in height. The fit for the XL is perfect. I love this company. All their stuff is fair price. I guess someone figured out that gym rats and fighters are poor. But the quality is amazing. I bought four rash guards, loved them, then bought 3 more, and shorts which are also great.
Yes, XL is the correct size for your height and weight.

in my opinion no it may ride up when extremely wet its more of a dry sport or workout compression shirt
I'm 2 inches taller than you and 44 pounds heavier, and a large fits me nicely. I'd suggest you go with a medium.
It is too thin and doesn't fit tight enough to provide enough compression to help with sweating try another brand like champion or under armour
No I don't believe it compresses that well but it's a good fit if you get your size correctly
I'd recommend the extra large.
I'd say go with the large they fit pretty snug
Hi Visal..if u want it tight and fit go for the medium..I am assuming from ur weight that ur not that bulky..so medium shall do well..however if u have a big stomach or belly watch out..this will frame it..maybe u will have to go for L..if u dont have..then M is fine
I don't know to compare. But, I'm 260lbs, 44 chest, 6'1" in height. The fit for the XL is perfect. I love this company. All their stuff is fair price. I guess someone figured out that gym rats and fighters are poor. But the quality is amazing. I bought four rash guards, loved them, then bought 3 more, and shorts which are also great.

they are silver
Murano type beads. They aren't the best quality mine fell apart 2 days after lightly wearing them
yes
They seem to be about 1/2" or a little less. They fit beautifully with my very expensive beads. I'm not very good at this. I was very satisfied with this purchase.
Well...they are not sterling silver,but they do have a metal core. Great if you don't wear them everyday as they tend to darken (core)and turn your arm green. I and my daughter found this out after wearing them a few weeks almost daily only taking off for showers. But...if your only wearing them maybe a couple times a week and then keeping the bracelet in a plastic bag with the air pushed out they should last longer than that. Hope this helps you...
I typically wear cotton, but use these for traveling when I'll be doing a lot of outdoor activities like hiking, biking, etc. I wore both cotton & these in Costa Rica & these were far superior in wicking & drying after washing. My cotton ones were all sweaty & stuck to me. I'd guess these would prevent the yeasty beasties if you're sweating & continue wearing them more so than cotton.
Just one pair.
Medium.the underwear is a little stretchy and gives you a little leeway if you gain a couple pounds
I would go for the medium. I am a 35" hip and a 27" waist and I took the small, they were quite comfortable.
Same thing. Depends on who you buy it from.
I'm usually size "S", so I bought size "S" and it fits nicely. So I'd say go for the size you normally wear.
Yes - the stick on kind do fine.
I believe so., although they are a bit generous is size. I wear 10 (sometimes 12) jean and bought large as I thought I would rather have larger than smaller. I think med would have been better, still ok..
I'd say size 12 would be a large, size 14 would be borderline between large and extra large.
No. They would not be quick dry if they were lined.

The bag is 18" long and 12" wide and about 4" deep. It is very roomy
Ashley, it is letter W that you ordered.
They were not made with letter I. We will be offering these as a custom item very soon. Please give us a call for more details. Thank you.
Yes, it comes with the initial that you choose. If you have any questions, you can message after ordering.
No, it does not have a zipper. It is our most popular tote bag though!
It is larger than I expected in a good way. About 16"w x 7"d x 12"h
Each letter is listed for sale individually This one is the letter M
You can carry it on your shoulder if you do not fill the tote to capacity. It is meant to be carried on your arm or hand.
Yes, it does! One of the things I love about it! This is a tote bag NOT a handbag as many people seem to think! So, I think you will be happy with it!
No pockets inside or outside.
It has a magnetic button closure
I do not believe so. It attaches on it next to the face. Son thought it was cool for a little while. Doesn't stay on well, the watch itself. We were afraid to let him wear it outside the house. So he became disinterested after a month or so.
Small button type battery
Yes it is adjustable, you just remove some Lego pieces until it fits...you can even rearrange the colors on the band! it's just fun

Nope
Yes it does
yes, buy don't wear it when swim
yes, the mini figurine is a standard Lego figurine; the legs separate from the body, the hands come off, the head, helmet, light sabre, cape, etc. can all be separated.
Yes it does!!!
I ony have one.
Yeah has a padded laptop sleeve inside. Fits my 17' hp g6
Yes, there's a laptop pocket inside that fits my 17 inch laptop with room to spare... Living in Florida we deal with rain constantly, and I've never had an issue with stuff inside the backpack getting wet... whether it's actually waterproof or not i don't know but my experience with this backpack in the rain has been excellent...
The compartment in the front is a cooler.
Absolutely. Right now my bag has a Campbell Reece Biology Textbook, a macbook, a square REI lunchbox, a pair of jogging shoes, a shirt and shorts, and a charger. there's still some room in there.
i think so yes. my laptop is 13" and there is still a lot of space, the backpack is a great size, and it has a padded compartment just for your laptop in the back.
Sandwich, can of coke, and a small snack/bar or two
I bought a girls med for my 8 year old last year and it was a little on the big side (she is petite though). I'd say a med runs about 8-10..large 10-12? Hope that helps.
Hello, Thank you for contacting us. The size large is out of stock with the manufacturer and there is no re-stock date available at this time. We apologize for any inconvenience. If you have further questions, please advise.
I think she'd do better in a lg. My 4'5" 60lb daughter fits nicely in a med.
We ordered a child small size and it was a little big for my 4 year old, but very cute. It came to her knees. She still wears it a year later for dress up because it is so comfortable.
Nope.... no sound like Capt. Kirk calling the Enterprise....
prime is 2 days
There is no indication on the package or the product regarding place of manufacture.
This badge is a replica of the Star Trek 2009 badges. This is not based on the ones in the original series. The metal is extremely sturdy. It's not fake-looking or plastic-y at all. It's very well made and can withstand a lot.
Way better. Applies easier and stays on much better.
The issue with this product is that it is very very VERY thick and can be really difficult to apply evenly. I find that it also doesn't set very well and is really heavy on the skin. If you're looking for a all over white face product you should look into the snazaroo's face paint! Clown white is great for little accents or highlights in face painting but using it all over the face didn't work well and was uncomfortable on the skin. Hope this was helpful!
No. I only got one. You get them all at different prices
Yes it will! It's thick makeup so you'll have to use 2-3 layers of it to make it look nice.
No, they are for adults.
they are one-size fits all, but you could cut them down to size for kids for sure
No. Definitely for adults
The top is like a V shape where you put your toes
6 1/8 inches long by 3 1/4 inches wide folded and snapped
There are 2 larger pockets, 3 dl slot pockets, and 1 zipper pocket
Yes. My husband does not ride. He doesn't have the chain attached so its just the wallet. He likes it because it doesn't fold the money and the folding kind of wallets (tri-fold and bi-fold) won't close with everything he keeps in his wallet. This one is perfect and snaps closed. Fits in his back pocket on his jeans.
yes has a zippered pocket, 2 really good sized pockets, 1 smaller pocket. really well made. heavy chain. Good value!
the chain is about 16 inches long with the leather belt loop,and the wallet is pure leather is a very good wallet
At this time, Rocky Mountain ATV does not ship internationally through Amazon.
It has slots on each outside section that opens toward the center and a slot in the middle section that open toward the top. One of the two outside sections is used for the fanfold insert that has slots but can be swapped for another one with more or less slots as desired.
Smaller than the usual that I see. My hunney took it off and replaced it with something else. He still feels it was a good deal.
Yes, two snaps close the wallet.
The chain is 12".
yup, nice size for airport carry-on.
The interior measure 14 3/4" (l) x 6" (w) x 11" (h). It has a small pocket in front, large enough to slip in a cell phone OR plastic ware AND napkins, but not all three items. And there is a heavy zipper closing that runs the full length of the top. So - depending on the size of your thermoses, your lunch bag and your what nots, I'm thinking there should be enough room for everything. I read a review that reported it being heavily used for 6 months and still holding up well. It was exactly what I needed for a convention a couple of weeks ago. JoAnn Fabrics sells a similar item - only this one is a lot prettier! The fabric has a plastic feel to it. For what you seem to want it for, I think you will be pleased with it.
The actual measurements - H 11 3/4", W 5 1/4", L 15" - I am still very happy with the bag.
Probably stronger. It is made out of recycled grain bags and those are very sturdy. There isn't a pocket on the inside, but there is one on the outside although it doesn't have a closure.
The back side of the plastic. I've used it daily and it's really sturdy.
Large tote this is my favorte tote because of size slightly bigger than grocery store reusable bags
Standard size for a tote you're able to carry over your. shoulder
We have not noticed any odor at all or had any complaints regarding odor.
Yes it is exselent product . I'm wery happy with it!&#128512;
More like hand bag length. On your shoulder would be more under your arm than waist length. Hope that helps.
I have never figured out plastic things. The cloth is used to buff out your jewerly. This is an awesome unit, cleans super. I recommend it
It's 5" X 3" oval so it doesn't look good.
No...it is electric.
I think that is used to hold certain items (like a watch that you don't want to get wet). You could try using a search engine to get more info or maybe try emailing the manufacturer.
It works on house.
Not sure only used for jewelry but great for diamonds!!!
Frankly, I don' know. I use it just in USA
My guess without tape is 8" wide, 5" deep and 6" tall.
I believe you can use it on anything with a gemstone, the silver you may want to treat separately with a rub on cleaner intended just for silver since I do not think this will clean silver as a rub on polish would, I use it mostly for my wedding ring that is set in gold and it does a fantastic job of cleaning the setting and getting the dirt out.
I honestly don't know. I bought the jewelry cleaner to clean a probe from a lab instrument at the hospital where I work since a sonicator would have taken a year to get due to cost. I can tell you that the cleaner works really well and our area is pleased with it. Good luck!
It has a padded back panel on the outside.
60 days return policy , but I lost around 12$ for shipping expanses
I don't know if the product in question any warranty but as for the handle I have had problem with it being loose and I had to use a screw driver several time to tighten the handle...
No
About 24 inch.
am sorry if I responded late but this is the best shopping I ever did. it does have warranty if that was your question
Yes I would. Excellent back-saver.
I dont know exactly but I can fit 2 text books 2 notebooks a 800 page book and a 200 page book with a 2 1/2 inch binder not including other pockets
I'm in nursing school so my text books are massive I'd say 2 massive medical text books plus folders and miscellaneous stuff. I'd say it can def hold 50lbs.
No it only fits up to a 17" from my experience.
They are wide but my daughter only rolls it
It will stop at two heights- all the way up and like halfway (one section collapsed). I don't know what to tell you if you need one with a handle that stops at exactly a certain height.
Yes... it can
Yes it locks
I'd say 3-1/4 inches.
Yes
it's about 6" long and stands about 4 1/2' high
I think so, they aren't tiny If it is a large wreath, it should look ok.
No, they will hurt themselves and probably break the shoe. It's a hard plastic.
No, these are basically toys; I posted the dimensions in a previous answer. They are not deep enough for a scoop of ice cream.
6"
I ordered these for my niece thinking she would have cute Cinderella shoes to dress up in - wrong. They're big enough to put mints in on top of a table :/ hope that helps you!
The shoe measures 5.25 inches from heal to toe on the bottom (outside) of the shoe; the hollow opening measures 5 inches(heel to toe), the opening is 2 inches wide, with an additional 1 inch depth inside the heel. It stands 3.75 inches tall.
Hi there! Diameter is 1.5 inches (3.8cm) and the length of each rod is 12 inches (almost 30.5 cm). Hope this helps.
The base is @ 7" x 7"
13 1/2" for Height from top tier and 12 1/2 " for width from top tier.
They are about 2.5 inches by 3.5 inches:)
There is no exact size because they were likely made in a foreign factory by poorly paid workers with no quality control. The bags are cheap because they are cheaply made. The approximate size is 2&7/8" x 3.5" with the drawstring 3/4" from the top.
Outside versus inside dimensions.
I think mine took about 6 weeks to get to me, they are coming internationally.
No that big, I can put about seven glass beads in one bag.
matte color
Yes it will, and that is a great idea! (I just tried it to make sure it fits and there is a bit of room left and the drawstring can be tightened).
It would definitely sift through!
i believe mine were divided up pretty evenly...but it's been a while since i purchased so can't guarantee that is true.
From HongKong
I'm just guessing, but the one I have is approximately 9 or 10 inches from top to bottom. It holds all my shorter necklaces with an inch or two to spare. Great way to store your necklaces and visible & accessible, too. Highly recommend. My longer necklaces?...I put tiny nails in the wall on the blind side of my dresser! I hope that answers your question.
About a 1.5 inches
12.5" from base to top of bar.
It is about 12 1/4 inches wide and 12 inches long.
I gave it as a gift. But it is big. Maybe a foot tall. It was definitely bigger than I thought.
about 10 inches high. Useful for short necklaces and bracelets.
Larry, the pad is about an eighth of an inch thick (made of hard board - you cannot push a pin into it) and its plain. Since it's out of hard board, you cannot mount anything on it except for just laying something on it, unless you drill a hole through it. The pad is also plain, no slots, no mounting hole. Hope this help.
8in. x 14in.
Approximately 7 5/8 by 14 inches. I purchase cases on Amazon as well and they fit with room to spare, although the size difference isn't visible thanks to the framing around the glass top.
Hello Tiffany, The Velvet Felt on the tray an very nice and feels like a good quality, but the stiffness of the tray felt like a Hard Board - the type you find in hardware stores that has many holes to fit metal pegs into them to hang tools (except the board is smooth). I've cut these boards before and using a hand saw is almost out of the question, as it will be messy and crooked. If you have a cross-cut saw such as a radial arm or a chop-type mitre saw, it should work out fine. However, you'll also need to undo the velvet to separate the board for cutting, then re-wrap your board. I wish I could look at mines to tell you more if the velvet could be undone, but I just threw my tray away. Sorry about that.
I don't believe so. I wanted to use them to box earrings and they were too small. These boxes are probably only big enough for standard ring band.
1 1/2 X 21/2
Hi, Looks a touch too narrow Oxxxo
Yes, the short measurement is the height of the box. The two boxes in the picture are standing on the short ends and you are seeing their length.
These are way smaller then what you are looking for
It prevents rain from getting you wet. Alas, it does not prevent the rain from occurring. It is completely waterproof.
The first time I wore it in the rain I was soaked to my skin in 10 minutes.
I got a Medium and iam 5' 8 1/2" and 164 lbs.... I would get a Medium ... I think small would be too small
They made an error. "M" is same as Medium.
It does run true to size. Being a water-resistent outer layer of clothing, expect it to be built to intentionally have enough room to fit over base, second and and perhaps a medium weight outer layer. Now, if worn in hot weather with only a t-shirt underneath, it may be a bit loose-fit.
11oz.
Yes there are 4 records. songs on both sides Twinkle , twinkle little star, Oh where has my little dog gone, Au clair de la lune, London bridge,The farmer in the dell,Hickory Dickory dock, Camptown races and Children`s marching song. The record player is exactly like the original. Hope this helps.
Yes it does unlike the one they made back in the day. The sound isn't as good as the old one either.
They are right. This toy is an electronic music player. I miss the old music box version, it doesn't sound the same.
not sure but it can take a beating.
I bought this for my grandson who had just turned 1 year old. He loved music. I expected it to play the classic old-fashioned toddler songs. That is what it did. But, beware. The quality of the sound is not so good. I was very unhappy with my purchase. My grandson ended up just carrying around the record disks and used them as toys. I wouldn't advise giving this to any young child. Just my own experience here. Maybe others have had better results.
It's just music. But my children love it!
Yes it's defective unless you didn't install new batteries
either AA or AAA, sorry I can't remember. but no funky sized batteries required :)
3 AA batteries.
No it will only play the records that come with it.
Definitely. It will be big, but will stay on and will fit when he's 4T (perfect) and 5T (more snug).
I have a 3 and 4 year old and the play clothes fit them both. My 4 year old wears 5t sometimes too.
Probably. My niece is a tiny 5 year old they are very big on her. She only weighs 37 pounds.
Yes it's good for a 3 year old and up
The hard hats are adjustable. My 3 year old granddaughters heads are on the smaller side, so the adjustable strap is really helpful. The hats would be way too big for them otherwise. I have a grandson who is 12 now, but his head was bigger than average, so I know how hard it is to find hats that fit. I would say, give it a try. The hats do seem to run on the bigger side. These items are made really well. I have been happy with them.
I believe they were packaged individually and then stuck together as a three pack. If I'm remembering correctly, they could be split into three gifts easily.
2 years old. He especially liked the fireman and construction costumes. He likes to wear the construction outfit when he "helps" daddy.
All three fit my 4 year old and 3 year old just fine
Its weird. This one says 1984. But it really is the remake glove. I purchased this one because i wanted the remake one and it was the one i got. So you should probably go to the 2010 glove page if you want the 1984 one. They need to fix this problem.
The tips are. The blade part is thick and not sharp. I would still be careful with it.
Yes
Yes. The whole thing is metals
No, just like to others in the market, but it runs 2 size smaller than it should be.
Sure could be, but I used it in place of a wet suit and it worked great. No buoyancy, but it kept me warm and sun protected.
This is a rash guard. Not thermo. Hope that helps.
I'm 40 and have a very active body. This shirt is TIGHT! It will highlight it. I am 5'11" and 150 lbs. I ordered a Large because of the previous reviews. I brought it to Costa Rica surfing and was annoyed by it the whole time! It was to tight. And every time I looked down I was reminded that I definitely didn't do enough sit-ups to be wearing that shirt. Also it was very tight in the arms and neck too.
I am 5 feet and ordered the medium. It fits me perfectly and does reach the hips. It stays put. I usually order a small, so order 1 size larger than usual. I hope this helps.
pull over. its like a skin fit t-shirt
I'd go with XL
No shelf bra
No zippers. It's a pull-over.
I would recommend wearing a lightweight long sleeve shirt instead. These are quite thick, and most comfortable when getting wet.
I'm. 5'4.5" weight. 145. Bra size 38D. I ordered the medium. Fits perfectly.
It I true I size. If however you are slightly curvy like I am and don't want it hugging your backside, I would go a size up. If however you don't mind, stick with your regular. I love this dress!
I bought this dress last year, wore it at least 3 times and it still looks black.
xs-xl
When ordering just make sure your shoe size falls in one of the stabilicers listed. Small 6.5-7.5, med 8-10, large 10.5-11.5 ect. The stabilicer straps will adjust to fine tune the fit.
I can't answer your question off hand, but if you look at the post I made a couple of years ago, I included the conversion chart from their size designation to conventional shoe sizes that Stabilicers publishes on their website. Harry
They are designed to be worn with boots and that is how I wear them, the ones I have are a bit large, but the straps allow them to be tightened, and I think they are sized for a man's foot rather than a woman's. They work very well however, and have been very useful this year in the icy north east.
Thank you for your question. This listing is for Medium which fits: Men's: 8-10 Women's: 11-up
I wear a 32/33 and I got a large which fits great.
I am a waist 40, for men, and the "XXLARGE" fits perfect. However, if you don't wash it first before you wear it, then it will be a little loose right out the package. Overall, I have brought several over the years and I am very satisfied with the support and fit.
Ok ..Thank you for your Inquiry!
The jock is curvy to hold a cup,the straps keep it in place.Thank you for your Inquiry!
Sorry is the last twin pack in our inventory..Thank you for looking!
My waist is 37 and the Large is comfortable. I am very happy with these.
If you like your jocks tight , buy a small. I'm a size 32 and size medium fits perfect.
Yes, my husband used it when he got his vasectomy and he has a 38 inch waist and got an xl and said it was comfortable.
We are out of stock of 44 waist at this time.Thank you for your inquiry!

I am 5'8 176lbs and large fits me well (i lift weights). So medium should fit you. However, a reviewer gave me advice that worked perfectly. He said to buy the suit that is the same size as your t shirts. My t shirts ard large (42-44) chest.
rashguard, in general, and this shirt, in particular, is worn for sun protection, not to keep warm. For that, you will need a wet suit made of neoprene, which comes in long or short sleeve and varying thickness.
I am 6' and 180 and the XL was too long so I returned it and went with the large which fits great. I would go with the medium or maybe even the small for your son since it seems like they are long in the arms and torso.
I'm 185 and 5"11 and the large fits me perfect. I'd say maybe a medium.
Yes, cold wash and rinse with no bleach or softener.
are the same thing !!
IF WET, YES
This shirt will not stop you from swimming, and assuming your arms move normally without the shirt, they should function just as well with this shirt on. However, I should caution that this shirt will NOT cure your arms if they do not currently move normally, nor will it teach you to swim if you are currently unable. A more serious answer, this shirt feels great, like a typical base layer shirt that is a bit snug.
Yes
Well, I wore it for my Hawaiian vacation in November 2014. This thing runs on the tighter, smaller size. So, you might want to go for 1 size above your normal size. I normally wear small, and I ordered Small, which felt a tad too tight around the chest. I should have ordered a Medium. Other than that, it's well made and feels nice. It looks good, too. I played in the ocean for days without getting my body burned. Highly recommended. Just make sure you order a size that's a little bigger than your normal size and you'd be set.

I would still use a separate guard. I do not really notice too much support knee wise just decent muscle compresion.
It felt like gradient pressure. Ankle pressure was good... waist band was too tight, and not comfortable at all. Compression socks feel better.
Actually, they can be worn during any physical activity. Since I'm a gym rat they work great during interval or circuit training. Try them either way and I'm sure you'll be pleased.

When I bought them it was only one pair.
I wear size 13 and I believe I ordered the XL and they fit really well.
The best way I can describe it is "normal". I wear size 13 and they fit just right, not too big or too small.
I wear size 13.
Yes
Real fur? Heck, it is a real horse!
Don't listen to these people i think you can totally breathe out of this mask while running a marathon where your body uses every bit of oxygen it takes in. I would get a tail just to complete the look but other thyan that, strap it on, YEEEHAW!!!
Yes, but if you're trying to give your pining daughter a pony on the cheap, you'll have to concoct an elaborate series of explanations for the many anomalies. Maybe explain that said pony is afflicted with dwarfism and subsequently raised with a dog litter, thus explaining the pony's barking.
A very small one, but it will do amazing things for the horses self confidence! With this mask he will be looking like a horse in no time, free to frolic with the other small horses without fear of being made fun of!! KCCO
Usually, yes. But, sometimes it may come not completely hollowed and you may have to do it yourself.
Only if it is smaller than the head of a horse. Otherwise, you should probably seek medical care, anyway.
Yes , only if you truly believe that you can become one with the horses.
The toxic VOC fumes coming from this mask will likely kill the dog and your wife.
Just put on the horse, and ask the source - he'll give you the answer that you endorse and put you on the steady course.
Measures 13.5" L x 8" W x 9" H, according to product details, this was a gift so I don't actually have it in hand to measure, hope this helps
Hi Norma Dont know we got it for my boyfriends mother for christmas. Sorry I couldnt be helpful.
Yes, really a nice piece of furniture.
Only locks the lid
Wood does appear to be pine with some press board. Be aware that there are small pegs that come with the unit that hold the drawers from falling out when you open them - several of ours were broken when we received the cabinet. A small inconvenience, but annoying when the drawers want to fall out when you open them.
2 have compartments, 6 do not. Drawers are about 7" x 7".
There is no lock and no key that we saw with the product. Sorry. Love the purchase other than that.
There are no locks.
Sir, the possibility of successfully receiving an incorrect lightsaber is approximately 3,720 to 1.
Yes it is. Also the set contains special cover to attach instead of removed blade. The handle is looking better on a belt clip with the cover attached.
I don't know what the material is but all I know is that this product is made very well. I was expecting more of a "toyish" product and I was pleasantly surprised to get a really well done piece. There are of course sabers that cost thousands more - but come on, you gotta be pretty gone mentally to place so much money and effort and time in getting a light saber for hundreds of dollars thinking they are a real thing.
Yes I believe it is a polycarbonate just like the non-removable blade models. I would say the plastic is highly durable but the electronics inside are not so I wouldn't advise hitting this thing against anything beyond a light tap to initiate the clash sound effect
It won't turn off as long as the on button is in the on position
Fans of Darth Vader
No, but when you don't have the blade in it makes a kind of static noise it's honestly quite impressive.
Yes. It'll make the humming sound but that'll be all. The other sounds are made when moving the saber or when you clash it.
That would be where the strip of led lights connects in the middle. Most of the replica lightsabers are constructed in much the same way. It is visible to a certain degree but should not be that noticeable.
No but you can see what's called the corn cob effect the LED strip if not properly spaced.. Can leave a visible shadow... Sadly with a strip blade there is no way to avoid this... Even in high end led strip blades such as a makoto lightsaber
Well worth the money, Kendra. I used these to make bead bracelets as gifts, but can barely part with them! LOL. Buy and enjoy.
Yes Simon
No is not 925
Yes it was 925 sterling Silver!!!! But its shorter than 7.5"!!!!!!
Sorry for the late response but the size runs a bit small.
No! It's great.
It is 10/12 in like childrens. (Girls sizes in childrens)
No the dividers are I next under a layer of fabric. They don't come out or adjust in size
They are rigid, can't move them. Glasses would fall out if mounted.
There is some play in the slots,I think if the protected boxes are not huge.you should be ok! Hope this helps
I wear all different sizes & have had no problems so far....I have everything from the round avitar to the big ones that look like they came from the 70s (my favs) & they all fit with no problems. Hope this answer helps :)
Def. not 5, but more like 2 3/4 x 6 inches approx. per "box".
There are two laces in each packet.
I don't remember for sure, but probably 45" as I was looking for shorter laces. The ones that came with my shoes were too long for me.
I got two lengths, 45 inches and I think 30 some inches. But I have not measured them to see if the named length is correct or not.
The laces should be great. Just take your old ones out, measure their length and get the closest length of these.
about 0.4 mm

My son is 8 years old & wears a size 7-8, it fit fine. My son is tall, the pants were a little short. No problem, I just made sure he wore black socks.
It includes the hat a tape on beard and a shirt/vest one piece. The pants are something separate
Small is 4-5, large is 12-14.
I'm not sure, but it was shipped from within the US. I gave them for gifts and they loved them.
I didn't get proof that the are real but my cat seems to think they are, I bought them for him to play with. They do look like the real thing, you can feel and see the claws and bonesHope this helps.
Authentic, real genuine article.
Sorry, packed 4 to an order
No . Maybe a monkey or hamster
unfortunately my daughter has placed several of these on my head so I can assure you they will fit adults
Yes there are smallish 1-2 inch combs at the back on either side.
Yes that is true
No, they would be too big
18 inches tall? I'd say not. Head circumference? Probably too small. They're around 5-7 inches across.
From what i can tell they are pretty much as shown. I haven't opened the box.
Not really
7 rows: 2 rows of 9"x2" (about 3/4" deep), the other pockets are flat: 2 rows w/ 4 pockets, 2"x2", 1 row w/ 2 pockets, 4.5"x2", 1 row w/3 pockets, 3"x3", 1 row w/2 pockets, 3.3"x 3.3". I love this and have three of them. I paid a little less than $15 each for them, after Christmas 2012. My daughter paid more to give me the first one for a Christmas gift.
Yes, it will roll up, and so far I've been pleased with it.
roughly 8 1/2" x 19 1/2" when it's opened up. It folds up w/ velcro closure in 1/3s.
The shirt is big and the helmet is a little big (but light weight) I bought it for my son when he was 2 1/2 and he's now 3 but it's perfect for him .. He feels like a real football player and looks like one 2 !! I bought him 2 different teams and I'm about to buy him another one .. It's great buy it for him .. He will love it
I would say it's a roomy Boys Medium. My son is 5 1/2 and wears a Small (6/7) and it's big on him but not by that much. The helmet fits me.
I used it for my wedding dress and it did not rub off. I traveled with it from St. Louis to St. Lucia and back. It worked well for me.
I don't know but it's very light weight.
It would definitely fold, but it's a bit bulky. It would probably be the only thing you could fit and it would be a tight squeeze at best. You may want to check and see if your airline allows a garment bag instead of a carry on and use a larger purse for other essential items.
it might i haven't looked at mine since my wedding but you should ask yourself why you needed to get your dress a year early when styles change and your body will change as a result of all of the upcoming stress you will have to endure? Also more then likely, and this happened to me your dress will go on sale and everyone will think you bought a cheap mark down anyways.
sandalwood scent
I do not know if they would turn green. I oiled mine with sandalwood essential oil so they are now affected (darker brown) by that. You need to ask vendor.
i don't see why not :) the beads - any beads - become filled with energy of mantras or prayers. they don't differentiate :)
I am 5'4" and around my neck the bottom of the tassel reaches my bellybutton and the guru bead is about an inch from the bottom of my sternum.
Mine is roughly 32-inches, the beads are not small either. I do wear mine as a necklace, or wrap it around my wrist as a bracelet quite often. I very much love mine, and have given a few as gifts.
Around 1/4 of an inch each.
As I understand it. Prayer or meditation beads are connected to Buddhist and Hindu religion. However, Catholics have the Rosary. The beads are used to count or concentrate while praying or meditating. The scent of sandlewood reminds us of nature and can be considered calming. The lucky cat...not sure.
it's in the translation--Cantonese is got 3 different meanings of the same word--it's their meaning of the word. a green wood when used, it also has a vague meaning of scent ,and a food flavor
I don`t know because unfortunately I haven`t received them so far! Sorry about that!
ah, sadly enough it was made of a nice kind of metal, but it is now Very tarnished, meaning it turned reddish color if worn frequently, due to the coloring rubbing off revealing the cheap metal below. Now, sadly enough every set of vongola rings use this metal or a metal that tarnishes because it's cheap, unless you're willing to pay 150$-250$ for a Real silver set.' hope i helped!
Yes
I'm not a hundred percent sure what size they are. I usually wear a size 7 but they fit a little big so I'm guessing its bigger than that and all of them are different sizes. Only the sky ring fit me. Sorry I know this is probably not a good answer.
you just get one for each ear. I remember when they were $8 when I first started buying them years ago. I guess the thinsulate is costlier than the older fleece.
no get the med the small wont fit
I haven't used any kind of headset with my earbags. If the headset has larger earphones with a headband, I don't think they would work. If they are earbuds that fit closely into the ears with small wires going to them, I think they would work. The earbags fit closely around your ears. There isn't enough room for anything large or a band holding them to your ears. Hope this helps.
no noise blocking at all
one
No. It's already put together. It's a larger box.
Each bar is 12 1/4" long exactly. The diameter of each bar is 2" wide.
some are 1 1/2 and some are 2 inches in circumference you'll have to ask the seller
1 9/16"
The fabric is a cotton linen of good quality. Nice enough that she can wear the mini skirt and shirt with a pair of boots to school. It is by no means stretchy so make sure to go up a size or two. My daughter has an XL and the shirt is 16 inch across the top pf the shoulders and the waist is 32 inches
No its not.you will wanna order a bigger size.
The measurements your supplied us with don't really match up with any of the sizes provided. Your best bet would be to purchase a size that is bigger than all your measurements and then have this taken in. I don't believe a particular size will fit you without alterations. Thank you.
My daughter is a juniors size large and pants size 9 and i bought this outfit in a X large and it fit perfect so if I had gotten a large it would have been to small. I would suggest going up a size from the jacket size. If your daughter is in a Juniors x-small go up to a small or medium. This cosplay outfit is really good quality and I got it for my daughter 2 years ago and she is still wearing it. I will get my daughters measurements and ask her how the jacket fit in proportion to her size now for you today. email me back at dauzzone@gmail.com or through amazon questions
Yes. My wife uses hers every day and they are still in good shape after about two years.
There are three handle positions. I just checked :)
The front flap can be locked but is large enough for an iPad so might not be the best place to transport files. The main compartment has a place where you can purchase a luggage lock for securing that area. However, the bag does not come with a lock.
I have the single retractable bar. I love this bag, BTW. It fits my needs nicely and I get a lot of compliments on it.
Not very heavy. Of course the more you add, then weight increases. I love mine and the red color!
I have no idea. If your talking about the handle I wondered the same this. I even compared it to the photos from the actual company website. I have only purchased the red one, still holding up great.
No, the bag is to wide. Part# 96495 LA GRANGE Maximum Screen Size Supported: 15.4" Compartment Height: 15" Compartment Width: 2.50" Compartment Length: 12"
The picture shows zip, but mine came with clips. Debating whether to return.
I don't think it would hold enough books. They are too thick. I went to law school as well and most of us used rolling carry on bags for our books and laptops. Eventually I wound up getting a locker, which I highly recommend if they are available at your school. If you were only carrying one or two books at a time this bag would be ok. Good luck with classes.
You have the option of 3 handles. The attached "handbag" handles are fixed, so those are always seen. There is an optional shoulder strap that you can clip onto the rings. Then there is the pull-up handle for rolling the bag. That one can be pulled up when you want to use the wheels, or pushed down and hidden if you want to use the handles or shoulder strap.
Yes easily. Also nice that it can be rolled down the aisle of an airplane.
YES! My laptop measures 15"X 10" X 1.5" and it fits perfectly with some extra room on the width! So, you'll have plenty of room. I LOVE this bag and I get compliments on it all the time. My only complaint is that once you get the laptop in, and power cord, you will have very limited space for other items, files, etc. You just have to be particular about what you carry along with the laptop. Good luck! Hope this helps!
I have a laptop (13inch MacAir) and full sized ipad, plus cords & files. I would think two laptops would fit tightly, but am not sure.
It a great bag and I recived a lot for compliments on it but the inside is small and not to many books will fit in Otto would not put a lap top and text books.
Yes, I was able to fit this bag (with the wheeling part still on) under the airplane seat -- but it took up the entire space. So my feet could not go under the seat at all. That was fine for a short flight. On a longer flight, I put it overhead.
I have a 16" that fits comfortively. I don't think it will accommodate anything larger.
The handles on the bag are very securely fastened. The handle/pull mechanism has held up really well for me. I have even put items on top of my bag, increasing the weight, and it's has performed really well. I love my bag!!
Yes, the wheels are very smooth with no issues.
The red one I ordered came with a oval- shaped handle.
no it won't!! barely got my 15 inch in there.
Yes
Yes
Not very heavy, but it doesn't fit into the badge holder unless you cut the leather with a razor blade.
The Under Armour product page (https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/mens-resistor-lo-cut-six-pack/pid1219032-001) says L should fit a 9 to 12 1/2.
6 Pairs of great sox!
My guess is size XL -- my son's foot is size 14 M, and XL works well for him. My other son has a size 11 and wears the size L.
I would purchase the large.
No, I am a size 10.5 and the large is a snug fit on me!
I purchased the mediums for my size 9 feet, and they fit pretty snug, but probably how they're supposed to fit. No complaints there. My bro has the same mediums for his size 8 feet, and he likes them. I imagine that a size 10 would be about as far as you would want to push it if you're ordering the mediums. As I have mentioned in another review, though, they are not really no-show; the "under armour" strip will be legible unless you're wearing a mid- to hi-top shoe. Hope that helps.
So far, they're holding just fine. And yes, no surprises with regards to the quality.
I believe so.
I am a size 12 and got large but half the socks didn't fit me. It was like the package had two sizes. One was great. The other was very tight and barley covered my heal.
dont buy these socks unless you like holes in your socks

Odd, I swear it was in the product title when I bought these a few weeks ago. But assuming they haven't changed it, it's a six pack of pairs (so 12 socks total). Hope that helps.
Under armour has a foot size chart on their website. Google for foot size chart and scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page. I'm an 11 shoe size and I bought a large, which is 9 - 12.5 for that shoe size. Fits perfectly.
Adult meduom
I would return them and.let both amazon and underarmor know about it. I was not impressed with these socks either. The listing originally said they were seamless at the toe. Untrue.
11-12
No. $35.13 is just how much an independent seller is trying to rip off for a pack of these socks. Select your size and color and you'll get the correct price for a set of 6 pairs of socks. You should ultimately get these for less than $15.
I have a size 12W and these socks in large barely fit. I'd say if you can find the extra large, they'd probably be right.
Not that i know of. I buy the extra large, shoe side is 13.
No
If you wear a size 10 shoe you should get the large 6-12 size. I wear a size 14 in men's and the extra large sock fits me well!!
Due to the waist band having an elastic hidden band for comfort, I would say they run a size bigger than normal. I have thick thighs as well and found that if I had ordered a size smaller it would have been a perfect fit for me. I have a curvy figure so it's sometimes hard for me to judge what would work. I feel confident that if you order a size smaller than your normal perfect fit you will be happy.
These pants performed beautiful in both humid weather as well as cold weather. I wore the pants in Costa Rica, where there is a diverse climate from the lowlands to the highlands.
Yes
Mine were unhemmed and at least 4 inches came off the bottom. If they had been a 32" inseam I probably would not have had to hem them. I about 5' 5 1/2" and like my pants long. Maybe they are hemming them now?
If you go to this website, http://www.opticsplanet.com/24-7-pants-ladies.html, you can find the sizing chart on the left side of the page under Documents. If the link doesn't work for you, copy the name of the product (in this case, TRU-SPEC Women's Lightweight 24-7 Pant) and one of the websites will have it :) Now, I don't know how accurate that is as I haven't got my pants yet, but this is what I used! Hope this helps!
No they are not....
No.....
I would say the pants are true to size. I'm 5'7 and about 154 I usually wear a 6-8 and a size 8 fits perfectly. Hope this helps.
If I remember correctly, they come unhemmed. I'm pretty tall and there was plenty to work with.
I would suggest a size 6...I'm 5'5'' @120lbs and wear a size 4 comfortably. There's extra elastic stretch in waist also. They ship unhemmed, which is a great thing, so you have them hemmed for your liking! These pants are wonderful!!

Yes it is. I'm looking at mine right now. And it's hanging by a window. Light definitely goes through it (diffused) but you can't see the dress inside it. I purchased it specifically for that reason as I had no other place to store it where my (now husband) couldn't see it as we have a tiny apartment with no closet space. It's roomy and has a pocket for accessories. I recommend it!
It's definitely going to have some synthetic content, but it's not "plastic". It's a really soft, but yet, not thin material. I have head my wedding gown in this for almost 2 years now. It doesn't smell at all - I'm still glad I bought this product. It's a quality item, in my opinion.
The bag has the potential to fold over, however, with a large garment in it, it would be very difficult to fold. I have a princess style dress in this bag and although it could fold, it would be very cumbersome.
Yes, this bag has done a great job of keeping dust out.
This is an excellent bag for a wedding dress. It's even big enough to contain my folded train
No
Yes, there is a slot for a hanger and a plastic pocket on the outside to show a picture of what is inside.
The garment bag is white. You are not able to see through the bag.
Can't see why it wouldn't work unless your coat has a oversize collar and is very top heavy.
It's cloth and acid free
The lock only works for the top drawer.
Its 15 inches in height.
No, only the top lid.
Unfortunately no it is made in China
The keyed drawer has the two compartments at 2 3/4 x 2 1/2". The second drawer has 6 compartments at 1.5 x 2.5". The third drawer down has 4 compartments at 2.5 x 2.5". The fourth drawer down has 3 compartments at 5 x 1.5". The fifth drawer down has two compartments at 5 x 1 3/4". The sixth and seventh drawers are one compartment at 5" deep and 5 1/4" across. From where the necklace would hang on the hook to the bottom is 9.5".
all hard wood. Sturdy. I was worried about it being made of cheap materials but it was not. Was very appropriate for a gift to my wife of 20 years to put her expensive jewelry in.
Only the top locks.
just the top.
I have been using them for over four weeks and it does slide just as well in my leagues
Yes, they are
The entire top is synthetic leather, no real leather on their base models. To get a Dexter that is real leather starts around $110.
No Mens
I've really never cleaned mine except to brush them with a wire brush I got at the pro shop.
Yes the shoes are true to size.
I am sorry about that, but I do not know. Why don't you take the shoes to the bowling alley shop that is in some of the bowling facilities. I hope this was helpful.
I wear a D width and they fit me good. Not at all to wide.

should work fine
The threads are metal but there is a plastic end that as you twist is what separates the stretcher. The plastic piece broke in half on one and came off completely on the second stretcher.
Wasn't real happy with it
Same here. I store them in a separate little bag and tape them on to the boot stretchers as needed.

I have been using them for over four weeks and it does slide just as well in my leagues
Yes, they are
The entire top is synthetic leather, no real leather on their base models. To get a Dexter that is real leather starts around $110.
No Mens
I've really never cleaned mine except to brush them with a wire brush I got at the pro shop.
Yes the shoes are true to size.
I am sorry about that, but I do not know. Why don't you take the shoes to the bowling alley shop that is in some of the bowling facilities. I hope this was helpful.
I wear a D width and they fit me good. Not at all to wide.
Your regular shoe size is the size you order.
They are both
Dont know the youth sizes... I had initially purchase the XL but they were too big so I gave it to my fiance sons, they're big.
Both my son and fianc love these kind of shirts. I know for a fact that they would wear them year round if it was warm enough in fact my son also uses them for t shirts to sleep in. A rating of 0-5 I give these kind of shirts a 5 being the best
Hey Jane -Try contacting the vendor... I don't know the exact measurement for a 3xl but when I purchase the XL for my husband it fit him like a 2XL, it was huge, wow, we gave the shirts (blue, red & green) to his sons, since they love their clothes big. Love the material so I went ahead and purchased the white & red in a large and it fit perfectly. -E

I agree. Write the company and Amazon about the issue. Should be able to get your money back from Amazon.
The jacket is suppose to fit snug so I would recommend you order your husband's actual size. I'll explain why; this jacket fits very odd on a woman. I normally wear a women's large top because a have full breasts and a medium bottom because I have narrower hips and not much backside. However, I ordered this top in an XXL thinking it would be a snug fit across the breasts. Well it was just the opposite, it fit snug at the hips and generous at the top, shoulders and arms, like a men's size would normally fit a woman allowing for broader shoulders.
It's not as thin as a rash guard but is perfect for me. I don't put my face in the water but do swim back and forth with ease. I think you'll really like it!!!
No it won't keep you warm in cold water the fabric isn't that thick. It's better for sun protection.
Runs Large...also long, bodice and arm length, if you are tall order a size smaller
I bought a large because it looked like a woman's item. Small would have been a better choice for me. The beautiful purple color in the chlorine will soon fade to a flesh color.
I just googled this: an AUS 12 equals a US 10. Good luck!
I would say no. I bought it for water aerobics at the 'Y'. It's OK for that, but I wouldn't expect it to make me warm in very cold water. Hope that helps.

Size large
No back pocket. Side pockets, yes. These pants snag. Since my original post, I put them in the dryer and when they came out they were snagged on a zipper. Now these pants have a huge run like pantyhose.

This item is a fitted fit, so it is designed to be a next to skin fit. It should not be as tight as a compression fit.
Yes. Boyfriend is 6'0" 170 and the medium fit perfect. Not too tight but he can wear under jeans
I used bing and found the under armor web site for the size chart.
No they do not.

My opinion: Fits my 9yr old. He is on the smaller side of 9. Yes, it IS big for him. It is really seems to be made for an adult, but the straps are adjustable. He uses it for school and it works fine for that. Military style and camo were the key here for him.
after four days the smell went away, I just left it open, i believe it is what they waterproofed it with I have bought other things from an army surplus that smelled the same way.
No. I bought a Molle gear one at a tactical shop near me.
No is very durable, i actullay cary 2 cases of 12 pop cans in it, its ajustable as well, havent done more than that though.
Will work but not really a provision for a bat if that is your intent. If only mom stuff then should suffice.
I stuffed a couple of towels into the pack and it measures: @15 inches wide. @20 inches long. @6 inches deep with the outer pockets empty and tightened down with the straps. @ 12 inches deep with the outer pockets stuffed and the straps loosened. Pretty good size and very versatile pack. I would definitely buy it again.
I don't know.
Hi. This Measures 12-1/2" x 19" x 6-1/2". Thank you!
Hi. This measures 12-1/2" x 19" x 6-1/2". Thank you!
No, it does not.
It's about 5 and 1/2 inches round on each tier. Hope that helps
All three bars are 12 inches long. The picture looks pyramid shaped, but they are all the same length.
Mine is 14inches wide, 13 inches tall, and 10 inches "deep"-front to back, but the depth is only of the base. The three tiers are on top of one another, so it goes straight up and down on a single middle pole, not on three. (The photo looked like three connected stands to me which is why I point that out.
Yes, they will hang behind the following row, but it will hold them!
The base dimension is 18cmx18(7"X7") The diagonal dimension is 25cm(9.8") I hope it helps.
Yes. That's why I got it. Love it.
About 12.2 inches tall, but it would be taller with bracelets on the top row.
They are staggered
Each bar is 1 3/4 inches width; 2 inches height.
Dear Maria, We ship from Ohio.
Due to the waist band having an elastic hidden band for comfort, I would say they run a size bigger than normal. I have thick thighs as well and found that if I had ordered a size smaller it would have been a perfect fit for me. I have a curvy figure so it's sometimes hard for me to judge what would work. I feel confident that if you order a size smaller than your normal perfect fit you will be happy.
These pants performed beautiful in both humid weather as well as cold weather. I wore the pants in Costa Rica, where there is a diverse climate from the lowlands to the highlands.
Yes
Mine were unhemmed and at least 4 inches came off the bottom. If they had been a 32" inseam I probably would not have had to hem them. I about 5' 5 1/2" and like my pants long. Maybe they are hemming them now?
If you go to this website, http://www.opticsplanet.com/24-7-pants-ladies.html, you can find the sizing chart on the left side of the page under Documents. If the link doesn't work for you, copy the name of the product (in this case, TRU-SPEC Women's Lightweight 24-7 Pant) and one of the websites will have it :) Now, I don't know how accurate that is as I haven't got my pants yet, but this is what I used! Hope this helps!
No they are not....
No.....
I would say the pants are true to size. I'm 5'7 and about 154 I usually wear a 6-8 and a size 8 fits perfectly. Hope this helps.
If I remember correctly, they come unhemmed. I'm pretty tall and there was plenty to work with.
I would suggest a size 6...I'm 5'5'' @120lbs and wear a size 4 comfortably. There's extra elastic stretch in waist also. They ship unhemmed, which is a great thing, so you have them hemmed for your liking! These pants are wonderful!!
This bag is the Nokia of duffel bags, I'd be more worried about your washing machine.
northface duffel bags run big . if you need it for the gym get the X-small - small, for weekend or 3-5 day trips get the med. if you are a world traveler or if you have a family / large groups and need to carry clothing and equipment get the large or x-large . i have the med. great for me and my girlfriend on 3-5 day camping trips . a lot of reviews will tell you the med. will fit in the overhead bin on a plane and that is what sold me .
Yes, you would be able to if you wanted to.
I went to uk for 2 weeks and the large was plenty to store about 7-10 days of clothes, if you can manage to wash your clothes then a large would be perfect size, and much easier to carry around. hope my answer helped you out.
The xl is huge, you will have ton of room. Also, you can wear it like a backpack so it will be more convenient if you're going to be moving around a lot. If you're going to stay in one place a suit case might keep you more organized but I haven't seen many suit cases that match the size.
I don't know what is the dimension of a 'suit case'. The bag is more like a duffle bag. If you are flying, a full bag of medium size is too big for carry on. Small one should be alright.
It is water resistant but not water proof. So I would say the answer to your question is no.
It is, but honestly, it is pretty large. If you are hoping for a smaller weekend bag, I would go with the small.
The XL version
It is foldable as long as it is empty.

The inside of the masks are plastic. They are made very well.
10x5 from feather tip to tip. That is the measurement for the one in the picture in the bottom middle. Others are taller, but width is pretty much the same on all masks.
Hi Good afternoon! Assortment may vary. They are not the same style always but mostly the ones that are shown in the picture. Not any other style. Men can use one!
Yes. They all did.
Margaret, I gave this jewelry box to my granddaughter last year. As I recall, the drawers ARE lined with a soft fabric. It is quite a nice little girl's jewelry box. Well made wooden box and was a hit with our granddaughter. Best of luck on your purchase and Happy Holidays. Lois Darst
My daughter (8 yrs) and I think the ballerina is cute. It is made well and hinges have not fallen apart like on other boxes we had in the past.
Waltz of the Flowers
There is a mechanism on the back of the jewelry box that is wound to make the ballerina dance.
Fabric. Like a tulle. The ballerina is tiny; the box is small.
I don't think there are. The uit is adorable and well made.
It is a standard size jewelry box, perfect for any girl (my 6th year old currently uses it & love it). The dimensions are: 5 x 6.4 x 7 inches.
Yes there is music. It's very nice.
I dont think so...
This does play music.
I do not know. The quality of the wallet did not hold up to normal use. It ripped after a few months and I trashed it.
Yes it does. Only problem is the wallet is a little big and stiff. The good news is it still looks new after months of wear, the bad news is it's still as stiff as when it was new.
Hello, Not 100% sure but I don't think so.
About five inches deep and three across; big enough to hold an iPhone comfortably.
The legs have the holes to put draw strings in. I have looked into to this but have not found anything ready made with toggles. I have 4 of these now in different colors and I wear to work. They're very comfortable and functional. I work in an office of mining people and it fits in perfectly with those others wearing plain jeans.
I have not ran any endurance races in them, but I do work as an EMT and wear them as my uniform pants. I have had a couple pairs for almost 2 years now and they are still going strong after being in mud, dirt, you name it and beat to crap, very durable! The Teflon coating wears off after a couple months but they still are pretty stain and fade resistant. Hope this helps a bit!
yes they are, there heavy duty pants that most of the contracters use in iraq where its 115+ i hike the grand canyon in them last year and it was really hot. these pants are almost like wearing shorts
They do dry quickly, but I would say they do not wick away moisture. But they do not get real heavy when they are wet like cotton does.. Hope this helps.
Inseam...I've never seen a pant measured any other way.
well the 40 waist was right, have you measured the 32? i guess its the luck of the draw with what you get.
I would describe them as medium dark grey. 0 being total black, 5 being middle grey, 10 being pure white, I would call these a 2.5. The 5.11 website also has another colour called storm, which appears to be lighter.
they look blue in the picture, but they are VERY dark, almost to the point of black
Absolutely not, lol
I do not. I'm sorry.
I thought it was the box of crows also....however, it is just a single crow. I was surprised when the individual crow arrived. It's a nice prop but if you're expecting the whole box that is not what is actually provided. Sorry if this is not the news you were hoping for.
1 crow.
yes! Buy its.. its fab!
12 in in length and 3 in in width
About 10.5"x3"

I haven't tried a 15" laptop. I have a seperate over the shoulder bag I use for the laptop. However, I do use this for short duration trips on airlines. I've never had an issue with its size, as a carry on. However, I do try to mask it in that I put the shoulder strap on and carry it over my shoulder rather than by the two handles at my side. The airlines hardly look at it and certainly don't weigh it! The different compartments or pockets make it very easy for me to arrange and pack items of clothing, shoes, and the 1 quart bag of 3 oz. items.
Yes, this bag is exactly as shown. Very nice quality and good price.
Yes, a basic, nylon webbing strap is included.
I recently bought this item a couple weeks ago and the accesory has a velcro strap. So you'd pretty much wrap it around your leg and use the velcro strap to keep the size accustomed to your thigh circumfrence. However, it often felt like the accessory would slip down my thigh while walking. In addition, i was able to fit my iphone5 in the accessory pocket (perhaps you can try comparing the width of the iphone 5 to your device) It was a little tight but it was fine. The only thing youd need to worry about is keeping the bag from slipping off your thigh.
You can't see it now but it has a velcro strap on the back that you wrap around your leg. Also I do believe the larger pouch would be able to fit your phone.
I bought this one last year and the size is just right (about 5x5") you should be able to fit at least 3 kunai in each pocket
Yes, it's Velcro.
Yes, 100% cotton. They are a bit stiff at first but soften up on the first wash. They keep their color but seem thinner than some and after only two washings there is a bit of fraying.
They are thin they are sift after washing but I'm not sure how many times you can wash before they fall apart
21x21 inch
Costas do not use a number sizing system. They come in sizes x-small through x-large. Your best bet to get the appropriate size is to find a retailer and try some on.
Hi. They aren't mirrored, but the lenses are dark & I cannot see my husbands eyes when he's wearing them. He LOVES these.
Polycarbonate lenses are up to 10 times more impact-resistant than plastic or glass lenses and provide 100% protection from the sun's harmful UV rays. They are also lightweight which adds to the comfort of your sunglasses. So.... customers requested a more lightweight, impact resistant Costa 580 lens for use during fast-paced, aerobic activities and so they developed a polycarbonate lens that still lived up to their high standards for visual clarity and durability. The 580 lenses are available in the polycarbonate lenses and they call it 580P. Hope this helps you. Debbie
Totally legit and absolutely lovely. I was gonna buy em in the store and saved over $100 with a huge smile. I didn't know they had more or would have bought another pair so thanks for the heads up.
Yes, it comes with a very nice hard case.
They're plastic lenses. My husband absolutely loves them. They're perfect for fishing with the polarized lenses.

I wear medium, so I bought medium. Seems to fit fine. The sleeve length seemed to be fine too.

Sorry, I have no idea. My husband ordered this for himself and he is an Extra Large (6"4). If I were buying one for me I'd get a large in men's because I like my jackets large (for freedom of movement when I'm out doing my "stuff".) I'm 5'8 and generally wear a women's large blouse/shirt. Hope this helps a little. We do like the jacket.
I don't know. It didn't fit and I returned it. I don't think there's a pocket for ipod.

About the size of a soccer ball.
Grandson is size 6/7 and still has plenty room! He loves it! His mom had to hide the shirt occasionally.
I got this for my 9 year old nephew and although the jersey was a little big, the helmet fit fine and he soon grew into the shirt.
Yes
This is a one size fits all item, fits most kids ages 5-9, Chest: 25-29", Height: 48-54". The youth uniform sets (includes pants) come in small and medium
Fits my 8 year old a little tight and he is pretty average in build. Can't remember the size exactly
You might be able too. The decals are stuck on there pretty good but with some work and patience, it's possible.
8 is child medium. 10-12 is child large.
I see what you mean! It's a one piece, if you want a two piece there is a tankini version of this suit.
it dips down a little bit, but not deep, 4 or 5 inches center back, and the straps are on either side, secure.
I don't think mine digs into my legs and I am also slightly pear shaped. But we are all a bit different. I would suggest you purchasing it and then trying it on. Its a fabulous swimsuit. I don't regret my purchase.
I am 5'2", with 34DDs and long legs. Not long torso. I find with TYR swim suits I wear an 8 rather than a 6 as I might expect. The size 8 fits me perfectly. I cannot recommend this suit highly enough especially with the adjustable straps. Go for it!
I personally have not had any issues with it feeling scratchy but I don't usually do high intensity activity in it.
I had no problems with it on our cruise, I rinsed the suit out in cool water and hung to dry. No color change at all. The tag does say do not wring so I just squeezed and hung up. I bought 2 and LOVE them!!!
I am a size 18 and this suit looks great on me.
Yes Nancy, any suit with a high percentage of polyester has the best chlorine resistance.
Dear Anabel, in theory, you have a size chart but it is not really explanatory. I went a size down and this particular style is pretty snug. I am 1.58 in cm and 98 kg and got a size 18. The lower back fits really well but in the bra area and in the upper back it is tight. I hope this helps..I can give you more info if this doesn't help. Good luck with your shopping.

We bought for my 7 yr old grandson and it was way to small.
Yes
I would say no. It is big on my 3 1/2 year old daughter.
I included a picture of the measurement of the hat band. This is an outside measure so the inside measure is probably 1/4" to 1/2" smaller. Have you mesdured your grandsons head circumference?
I don't know the measurement, but I am 5.5 and when I down have the string drawn it covers half of my behind. It's a great jacket...you just reminded me -- going to get more colors..
Dear Tammy, this jacket doesn't have any light lining. Regards. Arturo A. Cuevillas
Yes, Darla, this sportshirt is unlined: think of it as a slightly water-resistant windbreaker which packs into its-own "tummy-pouch". If greater water-resistance is desired, get a spray-can of waterproofing from a sporting goods store & treat the hood, sholders & arms top surfaces: then it will be perfect for you.
This pullover hoodie is 100% nylon taffeta.
Eventouh I bought this jacket as a present for my brother I saw it and I would suggest you to buy a medium size one, they are not men's sizes pieces
I'm sorry I can't answer your question as I bought this jacket as a gift and I dind't see it ever.

The one I have says made in Nicaragua
Depends, do you want to look as though your working out? Go with x-small, but don't be that guy, right? Go for the small...
this T shirt is good yes you can get
180 pounds? probably a size Large
One (1). These are singled
cotton
They're not totally thick white. In my opinion, they're the best white shirts I've found and worn. If you're worried about your nips showing through or whatever, then these shirts should be fine. I mean they're like $8, just buy one and try it out. If you think it's too see through then just wear it around the house or to the gym or something. I wear the white ones to work (no dress code) and I've bought a couple of them because they'll go with anything and they're not baggy or long like every other shirt. Super inexpensive, I will only buy these shirts until I find a better brand.
Iv'e viewed it myself and it looks blue with purple tones on my monitor. I highly doubt it would be green LOL. In my experience these shirts are always super soft and the colors are accurate. My only complain is that when u wash them they have a tendency to wrinkle. But overall their very nice shirts!
XL if you like it snug and XXL if you dont
No, there aren't any ridges.

With one can, I've sprayed about 12 pair of boots in preparation for winter. Just keep in mind, light color fabric or material will either darken or turn a yellowish color. I learned the hard way. I will only use this spray for dark shoes and boots. its definitely not for cream, taupe or white sneakers, boots, shoes, etc.
Yes! In fact, that's all I've used it on, and very successfully. I spray two coats about a day apart. Make sure you spray outside and try to leave the suede product outside as long as possible (a few hours at least). Otherwise, the smell will permeate your home and I don't think it's the safest thing to be breathing.
I don't know for sure but I would think so. It would be a good idea to call the place where you bought it or even any leather clothing specialty store. There might be a better product.
I sprayed twice a pair if (faux) Uggs and 2 pairs of Merrells (like moccasins) and there is a lot left. At least half a can.
Yes, I drenched my 2-tone Uggs and, since they are the warmest boots I own, they are my go-to snow boots. It is 1 degree in CT right now (yes, 1) and I am about to go out there in the snow in my Uggs. BTW, they still look brand new. I say use it on any color since, once dry, I never even notice a difference (just my opinion).
Yes, the waterproofing effect works as well on clean, smooth surface leather items. However, if the smoothness comes from a wax coating, the effect and its permanency is much diminished. As for "nu-buck" (sanded outside leather, suede-like in appearance), the stuff is also effective, but be aware of the significant darkening it produces, proportional to the density of application. Try it on a less visible portion of your material (perhaps the edge of the tongue) to gauge whether the color change is acceptable. Good luck.
Yea! Gore tex is usually attached under the leather of a boot. Which makes the boot water proof for your feet, but the leather will still take on water. If you spray this on leather it will protect/waterproof the leather as well.
It sure could, at least while they are damp. The product suggests that you test a spot for that reason. Here is a link to the manufacturer. http://www.kiwicare.com/kiwimcmssite/us/products/outdoor/boot-protector.html
It's good for use on any of the suede boots, regardless of brand
According to TSA list of prohibited items: https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/assets/prohibiteditems_brochure.pdf - I would guess the answer is "no"
It will not stand up by itself. However, I have placed it next to an immovable object on its wheeled end and it stays put. The weight of the the duffel tends to push it towards that object.
I have now used it about 3 times in medium to heavy rain and the material appeared to repel most of the rain so I would say it is waterproof to a point where the material may become wet if exposed long enough. I'd say it could with stand a solid 5 mins of direct rain or maybe more but there are minor external material parts that may not cope so well but all round the bag has been great. The material does dry fast so I don't think it would be a problem if it got a reasonable soaking. I also think the material would wear well if it was exposed to rain and wet conditions on a consistent basis. You could also possibly spray some weather proofing spray which would enhance the ability of the material to repel water. Try checking the type of material on the High Sierra website and its properties as this may help.

I have this duffel and checked it on my home scale this morning. It weighs about. Five pounds.
It depends on the kind of trip. I took it to Barbados for a week and it worked fine. And I actually put one suit in the bag. So for a leisurely trip, with mostly leisure clothes, it would be fine for a guy for six days.
Hi Kathi - I'm in Australia and it's too large for carry on luggage based on the carry on size limitations here and I'm guessing it would be similar for most countries so I'm going to say no it's not appropriate to use as carry on luggage.
It is rather too big for that
No
Joe, I'm 6' 2" and it works very well for me. No bending at all. And it trails behind you such that it doesn't hit your heels as you walk.
Its more of a travel bag type usage. It would be good if going to carry their stuff from place to place with visiting. I would think its to large for a daily use to carry.
The flap has a Velcro strip on it and it folds back and over the wheels and attaches to the Velcro strip on the bottom of the bag.
In inches, I haven't measured, but I'm 6'3" and it wheels at a comfortable angle and height.
Yes, easily meets carry on requirement and fits in small overhead compartments IF you unzip and remove the small "backpack" on the front / top of the case. I routinely do that and just wear the backpack onto the plane and place it under the seat ahead of me with the suitcase overhead. If I keep stuff I'll use on the flight in the backpack, it is a pretty convenient solution.
I don't remember any warranty, but I've used them together and separately all year, we took them for a 10 day trip in NYC and took them all over, My husband and I each used it on a few separate 3/4 day vacations and now I use the small section all the time just for general use.
40x32x18 (cm) for main bag and 32x28x10 (cm) for detachable rucksack. Space is big enough for clothes and toiletries for 4/5 days and shoes x2 in rucksack (in autumn time so combination of cool and warm clothes)
HI Rick, The take off backpack does not have a specific padded laptop area - I use mine on travels (To Customers and also on the plane) and my laptop has a sleeve on it (Mac Air 15" ) and have had no problems, it is also protected by the front pocket as well as the shape of the top of the bag. Hope this helps
Yes, I had to remove the day trip bag from the roller part of the bag an use it as my personal item. They would not let me leave it zipped to the roller part of the bag because of all the stuff I had packed. It would not fit in the bag size checker. But once I had removed it from the roller part of the bag, it was okay.
Yes, all but one compartment has double zippers with room to attach a lock to the zippers.
I've used mine on airplanes twice (Southwest, Delta) and is perfect for the cabin. The first time it was full so I had to take the smaller backpack apart, which fits great under the seat. The second time it wasn't as full as the first and both backpacks fit together on the cabin. I wasn't asked to check it. It's smaller than a lot of stuff people bring into the cabin. And it's very practical! I'm very happy with it. It has enough space for a 4-5 day trip plus several gadgets on the small backpack (I carry a 15.4" laptop, an ipad, kindle, iphone and all the cables).
The main bag is just over 6 lbs - the packback clocks in at 1 lb.
Not sure. Must be close to shipping weight. Around 6 lbs or so.
Yes, both the detachable day-pack and the main bag have shoulder straps.
In total it is approximately 50 litres
My blue one looks exactly like the picture.
Regular size. I am 5'8 and it was long enough for me. I didn't have to band over or anything like that. It looks short in the picture, but it extends pretty nicely.
It will not stand up by itself. However, I have placed it next to an immovable object on its wheeled end and it stays put. The weight of the the duffel tends to push it towards that object.
I have now used it about 3 times in medium to heavy rain and the material appeared to repel most of the rain so I would say it is waterproof to a point where the material may become wet if exposed long enough. I'd say it could with stand a solid 5 mins of direct rain or maybe more but there are minor external material parts that may not cope so well but all round the bag has been great. The material does dry fast so I don't think it would be a problem if it got a reasonable soaking. I also think the material would wear well if it was exposed to rain and wet conditions on a consistent basis. You could also possibly spray some weather proofing spray which would enhance the ability of the material to repel water. Try checking the type of material on the High Sierra website and its properties as this may help.
30" x 15" x 14" Weight: 8 lbs, 4 oz Capacity: 6100 cu. in. Material: 1200 x 1800 Denier Duralite Warranty: 5 year limited warranty Linear Inches: 59"
I have this duffel and checked it on my home scale this morning. It weighs about. Five pounds.
It depends on the kind of trip. I took it to Barbados for a week and it worked fine. And I actually put one suit in the bag. So for a leisurely trip, with mostly leisure clothes, it would be fine for a guy for six days.
Hi Kathi - I'm in Australia and it's too large for carry on luggage based on the carry on size limitations here and I'm guessing it would be similar for most countries so I'm going to say no it's not appropriate to use as carry on luggage.
It is rather too big for that
No
Joe, I'm 6' 2" and it works very well for me. No bending at all. And it trails behind you such that it doesn't hit your heels as you walk.
Its more of a travel bag type usage. It would be good if going to carry their stuff from place to place with visiting. I would think its to large for a daily use to carry.
I would say the are a medium large. They do have the springs in the temples, but the lens are large at best not extra large. Sorry don't have them with me to get an exact size.
1 1/4"
Yes. Its "lightweight metal frame" I Thought the same until I received it. Regards
Between the two hinges (from the inside) is roughly: 5-1/4" Between the two points where the temple is soldered to the rim is roughly: 4-7/8" Bridge is roughly: 5/8"
If you already have the glasses you should measure them and buy the case accordingly because I tried the Maui jim case and it's too big . Too bad they don' t come with a case , although they are great fishing glasses.
Unisex frames from what i can tell.
it is adjustable. So I think should be able to fit.
I just tried them today and they are really good specially when you're fishing in very clear skies and at 38* C. I can say they come very close to my Persol, bought in Amazon, very close.
I don't recommend these. They're poorly made. Unadjustable. I leave them in my car for when I'm really, really desperate for sunglasses. They hurt if you wear them longer than 20 mins. Lens height is about one inch.
No
Size is slightly small. Material doesn't shrink or expand w/ wear. I up sized, and the fit was perfect!
It does not have any inside pockets. Just the two on the outside.
It looks just like the picture. It is black.
The inside lining is fleece but the outside is neoprene. The outside is like the athletic jackets that are made to keep wind and rain out without being bulky. It's like a heavy nylon material you would see on North Face and Nike jackets. It's thick and durable. I wouldn't wear it in cold weather without adding layers. Hope this helps.

Yes, it is 1/4 inch deep.
Yes it can hold regular sized credit cards. About 6.

Hi Lucille, Yes, we do engrave/ screen imprint on our products. To add engraving or imprinting to your order our setups are $47net. Please let us knnow if you have any other questions! Regards, Lisa CB
Not sure, sorry. Bought it to hold my business cards. Does a great job for that.
it will not hold the 2.5. the max might be 2 1/8 and that might be too tight. mine are 3.5 x 2.00 and they are just about right. because of the thickness of my cards, i can only carry 8 of them so keep that in mind.
These take the place of Long Johns! My husband wears them under his golf shirt...he got the pants and wears them under his slacks. Hope this helps!
I'd consider looking at the ColdGear shirts that are labeled as "Regular" or "Loose" fitting if he doesn't like tight shirts. The "fitted" like this shirt is, is form fitting and is close to your skin (not baggy at all). You can probably find these on Amazon too, but here is the link to UA's regular and loose fitting ColdGear shirts since it is easier to filter for just those: http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/mens/apparel/tops/longsleeve/loose/regular-fit/coldgear#products
John, These Shirts are equal to the a regular shirt. All you need to pay attention is type of compression of the shirt. I have purchased the Fitted which is a good one - it is the intermediate one from loose to tight one (on my opinion) to the regular day use and also for the workout as well. Some people rather have the other version which is too tight (again, my opinion).. Check it out which one is your son`s favourite for this matter. All my jerseys and Sport shirts are Large on size and it is the same I have used for this one. Hope this helps you out.
I'm only 5'6", 156 lbs, but have long arms. I normally take a 15 1/2 32 shirt and the mediums fit me fine. Try one and return if not satisfied.
I have 44" chest and large is perfect fit.
No do not have it
Go on under armour website to get sizes... these are not compression shirts. They are true to size
I am sure they are. I purchased this for my son and he doesn't like things tight around his neck. He is a high school football coach and this keeps him warm on Friday nights. My husband also wears this style as a high school football official. Keeps them warm when they are active out in the cold.

No
Yes, it does have a wire inside. But the tail itself is very small.
To attach it so that you can wear it? You can loop it through itself around a belt loop, or use some string to tie it on, or loop a safety pin through, etc. etc.
Yes, it is soft and fluffy.
There is a size chart on the Underarmour website. In the search field, just time in size chart. This will help you find your correct size. The fitted mock should fit snugly. That's what helps to keep the cold air out.
As far as sizing goes, I typically wear a medium size in tops, therefore I ordered a medium in the Under Armour. I received a large instead of a medium. It is an very form fitting top and a large still fits me snugly although it is a bit longer than the medium. I am a small person and the large still fits snugly. It has a good amount of stretch but will conform to your figure.
i find it really comfortable, not tight not loose, perfect. I did a snow run in it, and it was just perfect.
I want to assume yes, I ordered mine based on the picture and got what I saw in it.
It is a mock. Does not fold over. But i love it
no, washed up great
No
Yes
I would say a large, but if she likes a looser fit and extra large.
The one I got was mock, not crew. However I would just be sure to click on the image that shows white MOCK, not crew (there looks to be 2 options for a few colors)
Yes you can and the cape is beautiful I received a lot of compliments on it.
This Velvet Cloak lined in Satin is only available in lengths of 50" and 62" at this time.
Yes! :)
We do offer this cloak in the 50" length. Just send an email after you purchase your cloak stating you want the 50" length and we will make the substitution when we ship out your order.
No they are not removable.
I do not think it would be very easy to cut down. Not sure what the fabric is it is well constructed. You might be able to cut down if you were really, really crafty but I would not try.
I sent mine back about a year ago because it showed up completely busted, so I'm working on memory here. I think it would be possible, but not pretty. It is cardboard covered with the faux leather material. Anywhere you cut, the cardboard would be exposed. In my case, all the corners were already split open showing the inner board when they were delivered.
There is no lid....sorry!
Lisa, The bag is 12" wide at the bottom and has an overall height of 19" with the taper starting at about 12" (so roughly 12x12 in the main compartment). My son carries two 1.5" 3-ring binders and the occasional school book with no problem. Hope this helps. Mel
I don't think so. It was a snug fit for my iPhone 4s which is much smaller than the s4!
I am over 6 feet and 240 ish. Bag worked fine both off one shoulder or over the neck. CT
Notebooks and pad papers will fit but I don't think the large thick binders would fit. I'd use a regular backpack for those large thick binders.
It is a big bag. It is not to carry iphone 5's, unless you prefer to do that.
No water bladder hook up. Have not try its water resistance properties.
It is designed to go across from the left side. However, I sometimes carry it on my right, just not across the body. Almost like a regular book bag carry. I love it! I still use it and I have had it for like 2 years.
Yes, you should have plenty of room for a few diapers and some other essentials.
Yes but not much more than that.
the only lock you can fit on the zipper would be a travelling suitcase lock (real tiny)
I think it's too large too fit in the dishwasher but it is dishwasher safe. I just hand wash it the sink.
Mine is 1 inch
Chris, I bought them for another company I do business with so I have no idea.
The plastic is pretty rigid and would probably support a small frig. I bought this to put under my dog's Drinkwell Big-Dog Pet Fountain to collect her overflow/fallout. It also cleans up nicely with soap and water.
it's textured on the inside. The texture would most likely show through if colored probably not if painting.
I don't have it in front of me, so this isn't exact, but it's about an inch, maybe an inch and a half, wide.
We do not sell any styles in green. If you select a style where the ribbon attaches on the ends you could have a seamstress change out the ribbon or if you are a skilled sewer you could do it easily yourself.
It is either white or ivory...your choice. Just send us an email after your purchase or call me at 508-345-6030. Dave Elegant Bridal
It went all the way down my back. I don't have the exact measurments but it was long.
It works best against girls. They will pass by any boy wearing this.
This cloak is NOT FOR CHILDREN. It is for adults. It is very large. It is a FULL OPRA CLOAK IN EVERY WAY AND VERY HEAVY WITH FULL WINTER LAYERING. It is thick, done in 1800's style with the exception of the print pattern which is from the last movies NOT the first. It is GORGEOUS. NOT FOR KIDS. TOO EXPENSIVE TOO LET KIDS DESTROY.
not that is not a full invisibility
It is just a collectible item, replica of the one used in movie. It doesn
It is most effective against money and girls, both vanish as soon as you own it.
No it would not pass luggage guidelines as carry-on much larger than my official carryons.

Don't know about wattage (can't be much tho), but there is no heater besides the piezo itself on the bottom.
Barbacide
Yes
The wattage is 35W, and the capacity is 1.27 pints.
I don't believe it has either.mi add the water as warm or cold as I want. It is ultrasonic.
Pretty Small box, 2x3x5-1/2".
I don't know its capacity, but I urge you to get a different ultrasonic cleaner. Personally, I'm throwing mine out, it's that useless.
9 minute maximum cycle time.
I do not think so. It is designed for 110 and 22 will just burn them
Straight from the back of the device itself as follows-----&gt; 120V 60Hz 5.0W .... so I'm saying five watts. Hope this helps.
I don't know the precise length, but it's approximately 6 inches. You're also supposed to leave an inch between the toe of the shoe and the unit.
They certainly will! depending on how wet, it may take all night.
Hello, I spoke with MaxxDry directly and this item should only be used for boots and shoes. It is not intended for any type of gloves. This is an error in the product title and I will see how I can get this corrected right away. This item slips inside a boot or a shoe where as that type of footwear will provide a more rigid environment whereas a glove surface will collapse around the dryers.
The label says "Do not use on stones or painted/antiqued pieces."
Please DO NOT put stones or gems in this cleaner. It will change the appearance of the stone/gems.
No. This isn't the right product for costume jewelry. They have a gentle cleanser designed just for that. I have it as well. It works great. Super gentle.
They should, there is even a spot for one inside... but mine did not come with one either!
Yes, if it is silver. Rinse it well afterwards.
I had the same experience. Haven't worn some of my favorite jewelry since because it turned dark after using this product.
It does have a handle, so you don't have to submerge your fingers. The top of the handle may still have some of the liquid on it though from splashing around, so if you have a skin contact reaction I would advise using gloves.
From my experience, it will do a fine job on sterling silver and will not affect the stones, if they are real. The label says not to, but I didn't see the warning before I did it. Perhaps I was lucky, and you should not risk it, depending on the value of the item. Do not leave in the solution for more than a minute. I used a very soft brush to get into the crevices, and I rinsed it in water thoroughly. Try instead Connoisseurs Precious for use with precious stones and diamonds, also offered on Amazon.
no, the directions say only to put silver in the cleaner
One. Do not buy this. It is a small form. And you should be able to purchase it at any craft or Walmart for half the price. I was not impressed.
20.8 x 17 x 0.1 inches
School Specialty offers this item in a pack of 12. Thank you for your question.
Not sure why its called a kit. Unless they consider the hand prints, letters etc a kit. They only thing that came in my package was the cardboard form.
The buckle is a brushed silver, and the shape is round but somewhat boxy.
Not in an easy way that I can see.
I would say a small, I ordered a medium and I'm a 8
I don't have any size small available right now. Sorry about that. We no longer stock size small, as the medium and large are our best sellers. You might be able to find a size small from a different seller online or through Ebay. If you search Ebay for Peru Wool Belt Flowers, you'll find several in size small. Thanks
Yes. 34 on the most inside buckle hook. More than enough.
I was lucky enough to get the exact color I would have picked. Really love the belt!
I have a medium and I am a true size 6 pants... wish I would have ordered a large. Love the belt, but wanted the tail to be a bit longer. Barely enough to get through buckle with the medium.
Hi Amy, No problem, just send us an email of what color you are looking for on the base and we'll let you know if we have it.

5 in half inches, when you put yoy medical id on it it is about 7 1/2. It is really pretty. I have several and l8ve them all.
On the ID tag that you attach to the replacement strand. I found .I ID found my tag on Amazon along with the bracelet.
Yes it does plus a couple inside as well.
I had an issue with it coming apart at the seams. I emailed them pictures of the damage and a copy of the receipt and they shipped a new bag to me at their cost to Afghanistan with no problems. I just need to update my review of the bag that said the issues I had.
Zippered expandable main compartment add approximately 3,000 cu.in. CAPACITY: 11,508 cu.in. DIMENSIONS: 37.00" x 16.20" x 19.20" (expanded) AKA Huge! It's just as big as a govt issue duffle.
It kinda zips up and tucks in. No telescoping handle.
Yes it collapses easily under a bed. Not a very durable bag though.
The nylon is water resistant, however it's not waterproof and the zippers are not sealed, nor are the seams taped. Light rain for a short time would be fine, heavy water would seep in.
Yes
I don't see why not. Haven't traveled w/ it yet. My assumption is that due to size and weight you might pay an "oversized bag" fee w/ the airline but I'm not 100%. Contact who you plan to fly with and ask. Think about it, you can travel w/ the oversized golf bags that are hard plastic or nylon/cloth. Good luck.
Yes they are. I am rough on luggage of any sort. Are you seeing a video that shows this as a "feature" of the bag? Link me if ya can
I'm very sorry that we don't have a picture of the bag open! This bag does come with the three-wheel system and organization features. You can unzip and expand the main compartment which adds approximately 3000 cubic inches of cargo space.
As you are wearing this jacket, the zipper would be on your right. Make sure the zippers match. This item is a military issue jacket, and was not designed to be zipped into the military gortex parka; this is for several reasons, one being of tactical flexibility. It is almost exactly the same as the jacket I was issued in the army in the mid-90's, except with some minor design differences that reflect a different manufacturer fulfilling the government contract.
Yes
Not sure I understand the question. As I understand it,it is worn under parka or shell jacket not zipped to it. I wear mine under a EMS shell jacket and I've not been cold even in the crazy cold weather we're having in Ma. Hope that helped.
Don't quote me but I believe Medium. I (5'8) wear a size medium t-shirt (gap, banana republic, etc) and bought a med but ended up buying a small and it's much better.
Mine was medium
Yes its US made , it has to be berry compliant
I found them on Amazon. Army surplus stores are the best place. They might not be new, but you can find good condition one's. They really are warm.
I am 5'6", 170 lbs, athletic build. I ordered S and it fits well, except a bit tight in chest.
The site from which you woule\\ The site from which you would order the jacket lists the size of the jacket. I found that a seller ususally has one size which they describe in their listing so read carefully before ordering.
The colors pictured are the ones that we have, I don't believe that these would bleach to white
The four pair shown here are to depict the colors available. They are sold in sets of 12.
it depends from which seller you buy it' if you want a shorter shipping time then either buy it from a Fulfilled by amazon seller or from a USA based seller
They would probably fit the older girls. Ages 4-7. You could also try shrinking them in the laundry with the dryer on high heat! These gloves are an excellent 80s touch!!
Dear Customer, Thank you for your question, your package will be shipped out via USPS from China within 48 hours after the payment done. The package will take estimated 10-16 days to arrive to its destination usually.The ETA of amazon is not correct,if this delivery time suitable to you? Is there anything else I can help you , have a nice day.
Yes - 12 pairs - each individual package inside this set has 1 glove stretched over a cardboard hand + 1 glove inside of that glove. No worries!!!!!
Yes & we got pink, purple, green, & blue. The girls LOVED them!
I don't think so. I only received one glove with my order and I am pretty sure it did not glow.
There were 12 pairs of gloves total, each pair being individually packaged on a paper hand as shown in the picture.
One dozen PAIRS of gloves! That's a lotta gloves!! :)
We contact the customer after the product has been purchased requesting the engraving information. We can also take the information over the phone at 877-651-5186 Monday-Friday 9am through 5pm EST. Thank you for your interest!
Yes, it does include engraving. Two lines. Not sure about how many characters you can fit total but if you E mail the company they will respond very promptly
It appears to be plated. I have a nick in mine that shows a steel color.
Absolutely, we can engrave whatever you like on the bracelet. All you have to do is message us your engraving instructions after you purchase the item.
Ellen, This bracelet can not be adjusted for size; it will fit wrists measuring 7.25 inches comfortably. There are bracelets that would certainly fit a bit better for a smaller wrist size. Please give our customer service center a call at 877-651-5186 and we would be happy to discuss your options!
Unfortunately, this item is only available in one size currently. The bracelet is designed to fit wrists measuring 7.25 inches and is 7.75 inches long.
Thank you for your inquiry! Engraving font style is "block" lettering, all in capitals.
On back of bracelet DNR in BIG BLACK BOLD LETTERS
Yes VERY easy to read! Mine has not tarnished and I never take it off. I bathe, swim, clean, etc with it on. The only thing with any bracelet is the top part with medical emblem has scuffs and scratches but like I said I never have taken it off. It was too big for me but the jeweler adjusted for less than $5 bucks. Also the seller is awesome! They are so caring and customer oriented I'm positive you will be happy or they will make it right. I love my bracelet. The only thing is because it is not boring a lot of people don't realize it is a med ID bracelet. I always get compliments on it... Always!
not sure what her wrist size is but she loves it!!!!
I just pulled the insole out and don't see the words "all day comfort" on them, but I do find them quite comfortable. I imagine that if you didn't like the one that comes in the boots that you could just replace it.
I don't know for sure but i have big calves and they fit me . Which is usually a problem for me.
9 inches
I weigh about 160 and ordered the xl, very comfortable
Definitely!
I am roughly the same size as you and a Medium will fit great when you first put them on (they do not shrink) however they become rather loose through out the day. If I were to buy another pair I would purchase the small.
small or meduim
XS for sure - I'm the same height as you and around 105lbs...the XS is a little bit big on me, though I think the height is perfect. I've found it stretches slightly with wear as well.
Wool comes from sheep. Marino wool comes from New Zealand if I'm not mistaken.
No
30 inches
The pairs I have are made in China....excellent quality...still fit and look good after almost 2 years of wash and wear.
I'd get the XS. I had to return the S because it was too big on my & we are about the same size.

The shorts have a 9 in. Inseam.I'm 6-7 and they hit me about mid thigh.
Will fit in side pockets bit the 2 smaller ones. Those are for flashlight or knife
It should because the internal loop measurement is approximately 2 1/4 inches.
Not my preference but these pockets are deep and have a small shallow one inside
With the 34s I have, I'd say there is about 2 sizes worth of stretch.
Based on your preferences, I would have to say that you would not be happy with the Propper tactical shorts. I don't think they are overly tight in the crotch or thighs, but they aren't loose. I will say, at least for me they stop at the knee. Try some TruSpec brand and I think you will be pleased.
I ordered 2 pairs and they are true to size.

It depends if you go for the battlerip or cotton: via PROPPER.com Battle Rip 65% polyester/ 35% cotton ripstop fabric. This all-season weight fabric is durable, comfortable and fade resistant. These qualities make Battle Rip our fabric of choice for the public safety community. Cotton Ripstop 100% cotton ripstop fabric is lightweight, breathable and tear resistant. As an all-natural fiber, cotton will fade, wrinkle and shrink faster than synthetic fabric blends. Cotton fibers will also lose their strength under industrial wear and laundering. If color integrity is critical, do not choose this fabric; PROPPER will not accept returns on this fabric for color loss over any period of time. My experience with these bdu shorts: cotton are softer and good for daily wear, battlerip is better for heavy use in the field.
Small is 28" - 30" adjustable.
Looks about like 10" for size Medium.
Unless you plan on losing weight, I would buy the large. The adjusters work pretty well.
I wear a 38 and ordered a large which fits, but tends to be snug in the waist. If you are closer to 40, a size larger will be more comfortable.

Based on your preferences, I would have to say that you would not be happy with the Propper tactical shorts. I don't think they are overly tight in the crotch or thighs, but they aren't loose. I will say, at least for me they stop at the knee. Try some TruSpec brand and I think you will be pleased.
I ordered 2 pairs and they are true to size.
Sorry for the delay! From center of crotch to end of leg is about 8 1/2 inches.
8.5 inches
8.5 inches
The shorts have a 9 in. Inseam.I'm 6-7 and they hit me about mid thigh.
Will fit in side pockets bit the 2 smaller ones. Those are for flashlight or knife
It should because the internal loop measurement is approximately 2 1/4 inches.

2 rows of 4 double hooks on each side

im 6ft 4in tall from the floor up it comes to my pants buckle, about 36 inches, its about 1 ft across and about 10 inches deep, sorry thats the best I can do without a ruler. my wife loved hers......................
Lift up the top has three compartments and a holder for rings. (18-20). next two pull out drawers have compartments. Very storage accommodating.
Sorry was given away as gift don't know dimensions
Its a little under 4ft.
No fan. It appears to work similar to a chimney - intake air at the bottom inlet; air heated and exhausted out top. You can feel the warm air exiting out of the stack. Haven't used the rod type units, so cannot compare - previously used desiccant canisters - this works better. Have been quite pleased with the unit.
Give it some time to warm up and then put your hand over the top. You will feel the heat. I didn't believe it either, but it's been working for months now. I still check it every time I open the safe.
Just measured mine - 62 inches from dryer body to where it enters the plug assembly.
Put the hole as high or higher than the bottom lip of the door opening. At this point, your safe is waterproof, right up to the door. You might as well maintain that protection against minor flooding. Also, if the safe is going in a finished space, like a closet, it won't be able to be pushed against the wall because of the baseboard trim. If you put the hole for the cord too low, where the baseboard is, you will have to pull the safe out even more to clear the cord. If you position it 10" above the floor, then the cord can exit using just the space between the safe back and the wall created by the baseboard.
It doesn't remove moisture from the air . It warms the air inside and creates air currents which prevent condensation from forming on the steel. Thus preventing rust. Like when you bring a firearm inside in the winter, moisture will form on the steel. This is just the opposite, preventing condensation from happening.
It uses 13 watts. I found the specs on the Peet web site after my initial answer.
Yes
If you're getting a musty smell, you don't have enough dehumidifying going on. This device works fine by itself keeping my safe dry, but I live in a low humidity area, have central AC which does it's own job keeping moisture in my house low, and I'm not constantly going in and out of my safe. Low humidity is something you can totally go "belt and suspenders" on. Get this, get a glow road, get a rechargeable dehumidifier from eva-dry... you will never make it too dry. To sum up, if you're getting a musty smell, you're not dry enough.
I would consider a Rod type on a safe that big. My safe is a 14 gun with an interior cubic foot measurement of 6.4 but the Peet dryer does work well . The plug end of the cord is not attached so you either run it out one of the bolt holes or drill a small hole thru the side and run the cord thru it before attaching the plug end.
I would think not. It's designed to be used in a closed space (where it works well)
My daughter wore it when she was 9.
I bought a large and two mediums. The medium fits my 9 year old granddaughter, well, but is a little too big for the 5 year old. I should've gotten a small for her. However, she is a very small girl. The 9 year old is skinny but has a bigger head. I guess it depends on the size of the child's head. I can wear the medium but, I also have a smaller sized head than most. Hope this helps:)
If you made your purchase with Cashco1000, please send an email with your order number and preference to amazon@cashco1000.com. Thank you.
Same comment here. I would have considered buying five of these, but there's insufficient information about what the size actually is. Infant? Toddler? Preschool? School-age? You lost my purchase.
Once you have placed an order, you can email the seller indicating your preference.
Yes, left/right hands. Good to use as a beginner.
probably mens, they are pretty big and fat which keep you warm
bought these for my teenage son's -with average size hands.
If you are a 32 length I would go for the long. You want extra to cover when wearing boots or to blouse them. I tried a standard Medium (no short or long) and they were short in length.
Medium/Regular would be the best fit from your measurements
I cut them off. Unless you're in the military or in heavy tick country there's no reason to blouse them.
Yes, I would think that would work. They have a cord type of deal running through a casing at the bottom hem. You should be able to adjust length there if needed.
Yes. I just measured. The Actual belt loop is 2.25 inches. I measured exactly the open area that the belt goes through, in between the stitching on the top and bottom. I wear a 1.75 inch spec ops nylon belt with them and it slides through very easily.
We bought a medium for someone who wears 30 by 32 length is fine.
I have a 36 inch waist and got the large and they were just the right size so they would probably be super tight on a 38, I'd get the xl just to have the extra breathing room.
I would choose the Large. I am 32x34 and I chose the Large/Long. But I wear a drop leg holster and drop leg mag pouches which tend to make my pant legs rise a bit. I love these pants.
These TDU pants have an expandable gusset that is at the minimum size as marked, stretching up to at least another 2-3 inches. I always get 2 inches less than I wear in Levis.
XXL large long
Id say that that is a mistake yes.
In my opinion, they fit small. Ex.- L fits like a M, XL fits like a L, etc.
The material used for the sleeves is thick. So, it will not roll down if you roll them up.
I haven't tried it in a fire. Ill let you know as soon as i do. Sounds like a good project for the morning.
Im 5'11 and 190 pounds and wear mediums so the small will definitly fit you.
Yes
Yes
I'm 6'2 and 200. I bought a large after I originally bought a medium. I would go with an extra large for length.
Can't say for sure, but I'd have to assume it would match perfectly because both this 5.11 item and the Crye Precision use licensed MutiCam fabric, with the trademarked "MultiCam" tag/logo.
I'm 5'6" & chubby lol. Fits me pretty good with extra sleeve length.

No, it doesn't sweat, I don't think it stays cold enough long enough to sweat.
If you spill something in it, then hand wash it with mild detergent, then use a sani-wipe and dry it. Then let it air dry before refreezing it. We get new ones at the beginning of each school season, or if one of the grandkids get really carried away and destroy it. I don't think they would last very long in a washing machine of any type.
Yes. Provided it has been in the freezer until time of packing
No. You need to put it in a freezer for a few hours so that the gel that sits inside each side of the lunch bag freezes solid.
Hi John, the insulated part is 4 inches by 8 inches (dimensions of bottom bag) with a total height of 10 inches. Hope this helps.
for the $20 it cost, I consider myself lucky that it lasted through the school year and get a new one.
It measures 8.5 x 5 x 10 inches It fits a good amount of food inside. Worked well for first grade and second grade school year but got very dirty all the time. If you go with this product, go with a dark color.
We leave it in freezer. Its a freezer bag so should be fine. Haven't had any problems w that..Just remember you can't wash it only wipe out!
I don't see why it would get confiscated.... But who knows, maybe they might think you have hidden fluid in the sides that contain the gel-like freeze pack substance.
We were not questioned about it at all.
WINDS UP
Without actually having it handy to measure, I would say it's approximately a foot wide and 18 inches tall. It's a good size to sit on top of a dresser.
No
Thanks for your question, After searching our catalog I was unable to find a similar music box that plays "Fur Elise". You may consider checking out the "customers who viewed this product also viewed" section for similar items. I hope you find one you like!
I only have one cycle on my model CD 2800. It is three minutes with auto turn off.
I believe it's 42,000 ultrasonic energy waves per second pretty sure I've thrown away the box but this seems right Enjoy Mike_Tina
According to my wife it cleans tarnished silver decent
The voltage is 110v. I highly recommend this cleaner. It leaves my jewelry looking even better than brand new.
We are cleaning silver earrings as I write! It does a great job on silver or gold.
Yes, but don't put anything in that has pearls or stones that are just glued in. Tried to clean an old Sarah Coventry bracelet that I had, the gold part came out nicely but the stones and pearls fell out. Does a very good job on good jewelry.
About an inch and a quater and they can be be fitted I did it
Yes it does... It came with the original box that included the original case...
Hello, yes, can be used.
definitely.
Because of previously reviews, I bought this as a gift for a very small adult who is under 5" tall. The hat was a tight fit and the mitten length was way too short. Definitely for a child.
they are exactly 28 inches from the hat itself...they come to right above my little sisters belly button and she is 11 years old at an average height
No
I've washed it several times - it loses it's "new" look but otherwise comes out fine.
I don't understand this question-- if you mean is it okay for a three year old, yes it is.
Just one side but super comfy I recommend it
From the top center between the ears to the end of the paws is 36 inches. I am 5'5" and I can put my hands in the paws (mittens) while wearing the hat and hold them in front of me. Not hanging straight down, but not uncomfortable. I love this hat!
Just measured, and it looks like they could be adjusted as large as 25 inches (That leaves about an inch of overlap so you can still tape the seam together). They can go as small as you want.
They have a piece of tape inside them. so once you adjust it to fit, you peel the backing off and the tape holds it in place. These are really cute for the price.
They should fit an 11 year old fine. It fits me and I'm a grown adult woman - with an average size head :-) They are 11 inches per side, folded in half, so 22 inches total circumference. They are very nice and great for the price. We had a pizza party and the girls all loved them!
about 1/8 inch..I cut it easily with wire cutters
It sounds for about a minute, then resets.
I don't really know. But, I would say no, due to the fact that if functions with a 9V battery.
A lockable alarm with a 3 ft retractable cable. It sounds if the cable is cut, or if there is movement. I find countless uses for this, from luggage at an airport, to bikes on my truck rack to the door handle of my chicken house.
I Don't Know. The Lock Fell off my bag before I made it to security at the airport. I Can'tRecommed ..
This device is designed well. The battery compartment can not be opened when the alarm is set without destroying the device which would set off the alarm. The device is sturdy enough to withstand anything most people carry around. A sledge hammer or cable cutter would set off the alarm before eventually disabling the device.
It will sound for 45 seconds
There doesn't appear to be reinforcement other than the leather. But the leather is VERY sturdy compared to a regular belt. I highly recommend this belt for concealed or open carry.
Mine is 1 3/8" in width, and I do believe the buckle is interchangeable.... I have not done so, but it has 2 screws that connect the part of the belt that folds back on itself and secures the buckle. I honestly cannot say how much I like this belt... VERY heavy duty.
I would use a tape measure around the area that you intend to wear the belt.
It is a very pale brass, nearly silver and it is a removable buckle. It's easy to remove and put back together.
I would say it certainly can be. It is thick and sturdy so if you or any woman does not mind that, then certainly anyone (man or woman) could wear it...no problem! Very nice belt. You will not be dissappointed
Looks like 1 1/2 inches to me, fits all of my shorts and pants. Great belt, good luck.

Get the Hillsound Trail Crampon Pro set. You will have better results on the descent. These spikes are better for walking on ice rather than gravel. The Pro crampons have larger, more aggressive spikes that face forward and will allow you to sink the front of your feet right into the terrain.
I wear size 9 (Man) and got a medium which fits snuggly with this traction aid however I can see that it's possible that it could be pulled a bit more to fit size 10 however I'd personally go for large as these don't fall off. Hope this helps.
Hello! I looked at size chart on box which my crampons came. It gives MEDIUM to fit a women's size 8 boot. Only in the case of an unusually large boot (like for Arctic mountain Climbs) would I try the next bigger size, Rich Modafferi
I wear and 10 and one half shoe and bought extra large. They were just right. I do like them. Joe McCann
I've used them with my size 13 winter boots and they are close to the same size as a Sorel. I used them about ten times last year. And so far four times this year, they aren't having any problems. They work good and are very comfortable. I found it easy to put them on boot first, then putting boot on and tightening strap last. Good luck and enjoy!
Hello Patti, no the crampons do not come with a storage bag but you can find some cheap storage bags on amazon that would work.
According to the size chart on the Hillsound website xs would be the recommended size for a woman's size 6 shoe.
Yes XL should fit men's sizes 12-15.
There is a size chart for both men and women on the hillsound.com website. I recommend that you order a size smaller than suggested by the chart. I have tried both and find that the one size smaller give a more snug fit and does not move on the shoe/boot. These Trail Crampons are very good, you'll like them.
LL Bean has a size chart on their website for the Hillsound Trail Crampon and Hillsound also has a website with a size chart. For a better fit and a good snug fit order a size smaller than the chart recommends.

The box is 12"W X 22.5"H X 2.75"Deep. The swinging front door adds 5/8" to the overall depth. The glass picture area inside the frame is 9" X 19.5".
No, it cannot be reversed, it opens from right to left. Hope this helps
No it does not
Mine is much closer to black. The "distressing" lets some of the natural leather color come through in places, but the picture, like you say, is brown, and my jacket isn't. It's extremely well made, too, and heavy. I wear it every time I ride except when it's hot.
My advice is to visit the Milwaukee website and get chest measurements for each size. If you have a fitted suit jacket that number will work. I bought an xl in this jacket at like 200 and no am closer to maybe 220 (i'm 6'1"). It fits fairly close now even without the liner (as motorcycle jackets will). Try an xxl in my opinion.
I got an automated "can you answer this" email from amazon. I think the top number in the size chart in amazon is the "Jacket Size". Similar to when you buy a suit off the rack. From there it lists chest, waist etc... I recommend going to their website for sizing info (that's what i did). I bought an extra-large and my typical suit size would be a 42-44. It fits closely with the liner in and is short. But that is the fit of a motorcycle jacket. So if you plan to ride without the liner go a bit smaller, if you will ride mostly with the liner go a bit bigger. I like the jacket. Good luck.
The logo is in the middle of the shoulder area on the back of the jacket. It is barely noticeable. This is a great jacket. I am 6'4 and 195. I order the XXL and took the liner out for a looser fit. It is a heavy jacket and the quality is superb.
There are no plates in the jacket.
I'm a40 chest with short arms. I ordered the medium and find it perfect in winter with 3 layers, but without the liner it's way too big for my frame in the summer. I'm in VA, and travel by bike, so my temp range is anywhere from 20Fahrenheit to 90 degrees. I wish I had been able to try the small, but I'm usually between sizes anyway. I'm not sure if that answers your question. I would guess that a medium would fit up to a42 chest size, with the liner. Amazon and Milwaukee both have excellent return policies, regardless.
I love the jacket, but he back of the jacket does say Milwaukee on the top center of the back. It doesn't look bad
The jacket I received looked like the one on the picture. After two years of riding it has gotten quite weathered though.
The jacket is made in Pakistan.
yes, it's got the logo.
I find it comfortable especially when it's cool with a wind chill
Mine is the same all around its more of a dark brown than black
It's a big wallet, which is what I was looking for. 9 3/8"x 4 1/2".
Yes, it does.
Yes
No it's not. I use it every day and one of the buttons fell off; only after using for 4 weeks.
The dimensions are 6"x3 1/2" closed.
It does have cc# and dl pockets. So yes it does fit card and license
If i remeber correctly, it had one zipper pouch for credit cards. I eneded up buying a different wallet, as this one did not suit my needs
Yes, they fit over bulky work boots. They are quite large (I ordered the "default" large size) -- in fact, so large that when I first received them, I wondered if they would be too difficult to walk in. But the flap in the back helps to keep the slipper in place while walking. Our contractors had previously taken their work boots off before coming into the house to use the facilities -- and of course still had that option. But after being presented with the over-slippers, they chose to use the slippers exclusively. We have not washed them -- even though the insides got a bit muddy, we just let them dry and brushed them out with a stiff brush. It's not like the slippers need to be really clean inside, and the outside/sole never got dirty.
I believe they are one size fits all. I wear them over my size 7 women's boots and my husband and sons wear them over much bigger sizes. They are more of a slide on and scuff around slipper that is appropriate for quick trips into the house when you don't want to take your boots off for a short trip.
We recommend that you hang them up with the loop hook on the back of the shoe slipper and let the mud/dirt dry out. Once they are dry shake them out like a rug. This usually works better than washing them.
I do not know how to add the additional shipping cost for an international orders. I am sorry I can not help you with this at this time. Thanks for your question.
17 inches Wide; 12 inches High; 4 inches Thick.
4 inches
USA
Less than three pounds, I believe.
The weight is normal, I have not problem.
The depth is 3 inches before it is expanded to 4 inches.
You can get your whole hand under the handle and still have a little room left so there is plenty of room to put a small engraved plate.
The case should have come with red plastic inserts that prevent the numbers from changing. Upon removing the inserts, you push the round button towards the numbers, and set it to your combination, then release the round button. If it came without plastic inserts, its possible that the numbers were already changed, and as there are 1000 combinations, not feasible to try to find the correct one.
YES
NO!!! The latches both broke a month after getting it. They are not doing anything to help me either. SAVE YOUR MONEY!
Hi, I bought this bag specifically to pack my daughter's stuff after a semester of study abroad. We filled it up to the weight limit (50 lbs, as I recall), and checked it as normal checked luggage. It performed beautifully. Good idea to have one of those luggage scales, because you could easily go beyond the weight limit and that's expensive on International flights. Hope this helps.
yes and yes.. the zipper goes across the entire length, you could fit more than one chair in there. WE put in an 8 person tent, tarp, tools and a bunch of stuff, very happy with this purchase.
Yes
For carry on yes for cargo I don't think so . Cargo is by weight
That I cannot answer but I can tell you that I can pack for a family of four in this bag for vacation. We used to pack ski pants, jackets, boots, clothing, for a 5 day vacation. It fits a lot.
It all depends on how long the paddles are
Have not washed it yet but I am 90% sure it can be
The 16x40 is way too big for a carry-on. A smaller size would work, tho
To me it is very light weight. This is the 40-inch bag which holds alot. If you are putting it in a backpack, it probably weighs a pound to 1.3 pounds, empty.
No it has no pockets on the side or inside
I checked the bag on a Delta Flight in December, no extra baggage fee.
i haven't, but this bag is huge. 10-12 basketball will fit.
It's 65 inch long. 12 inches wide. No ridgid support so you can push in the sides and make it any shape you want.
I just flew with it from Houston via Frankfurt to Bulgaria(March 1st, 2013). That was my big concern as well, but in Houston the Lufthansa staff did not even mention the size of the bag. The bag is solid and looks like it will be my travel choice for a long-long time.
Yes 42 inches will fit. Mine holds an item about 42x19x8. Still plenty of room to hold a bunch of other stuff. Actual diameter is 17.5. Actual length is 40. The bag is nice quality. I use it to hold a bunch of sailing gear. Very solid for the price. You could probably put something 48x6x7 if you wanted.
It runs the full length
Mine didn't have any.
Have only taken this on a flight with delta. They are very particular with their bags. However this went in as regular carry on with no oversize bag fees. All you have to do is meet the weight requirement and try to condense it as much as possble.
Yes, it does. 2 handles and a carry strap.
It's folded up pretty tightly and flat -- probably 6"x6" plastic wrapped square.
I havent tied to wash it, but probably on a gentle on the new washers.
Should work. for the price Good quality
Yes
It's perfect for that use. It may get a little banged up on the flight, but you can carry a lot. I used them to move abroad, and I'm very happy with them.
Its small maybe 6 x 3 gave as a gift they loved it
Yes indeed
I don't think so? My grandma's played immediately. I'd contact Amazon for a quick return.
If I remember correctly they are small; measuring about 3"W x 5"L. Hope this helps you - Sincerely, Ed
face of box is 8" x 6" and 2 1/2" tall. Very Nice.
Yes, you can change the photo. Enjoy, I am:)
I don't understand what the question is.
Yes you can
Yes, the music starts when the lid is lifted. It is a nice music box. You won't regret buying it. I bought it for a special friend and she loved it. Good purchase.....
Wind Beneath My Wings
I gave this box as a gift awhile back so I don't have it to measure but my recollection is that it's about 6"W 4"D 2.5"H. Not huge and not tiny. I gave it to a child but it was pretty enough that I could have given it to an adult or kept it for myself.
There is plenty of space inside, my girls filled it with Hershey hearts for their grandparents. They absolutely loved it, it's so well made and looks expensive too!
Yes, it is.
Yes
Six times four inches.
It is really very pretty and yes, I gave it as a gift but I do believe it is nice enough to be used as a jewlry box. And, if you don't like it, it can be returned. But again, i thought the entire box was very preyy and I bought another one (different song) for my mom.
It just plays the music; no vocals
This is a musical, jewelry box with a wind up key on the bottom, and the music plays automatically when you lift the lid.....It is beautiful with a sweet, meaningful script on the front surrounded by a lovely scene as the background......
No idea.
No, it is not a digital screen. It has an analog display.
Shamel, I apologize it does not tell me where the watch is made. It does come with a stainless steal box and has a 2 year nationwide warranty on the watch, so hang on to your receipt. Thank you, Steve
The shipping weight is one pound. The actual weight of the item is less than a pound, but Fedex rounds it up.
If you are in the continental USA you would receive it within 5 days.
strapped, adjustable
If you wanted to place an order for a Qty of 20 we could fill the order within 2 business days
Hello and thank you for your note! As of today, we have 2482 available. Regards, BMW - AutoGoodParts
Sorry, we simply publish what BMW sends us.
Under Armour's web site has a size chart on it, here's the link http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/mens-tactical-compression-heatgear-t/pid1216007 Hope this helps
Cold/cold hang dry
The logo is only lightly visable. I bought them to wear under shirts as well and they work great. I didn't want a noticeable logo either. If wearing a semi see through dress shirt it may be noticed but Im not sure since I normally wear darker coolered shirts or non see through white shirts.
I do Karate here so its the same... keep it short - NO. It won't keep you cool. Sorry to say, it feels good on your skin, it won't feel so good under such a heavy garment... Plus, it will ruin this shirt... Live with your sweat, make peace with it, love it :) No need for anything under your gi. If you do want something, get a sleeveless top, but this this, its not as tight as one expected. Its good for jogging out showing off your body. If you want to keep 10 degrees cooler take some ice cubes. or spray yourself with that ice cold spray for injuries. If you want to wick sweat better, look for outdoor/hiking tops, they tend to wick much better than UA. I also tried Columbia's COOL ZERO or whatever its called, wasn't tight enough. Go to the shop before you order online, you will get the feeling yourself... Hope it helps. Again, this is one awesome shirt to wear without anything above it. I forgot to mention - AVOID COTTON! Unless you want to be weight down by all your sweat which might make you feel a bit cooler - since you're wet.
They are long enough and do stay tucked in. I where them everyday in my inform for work and when I where a suit.
Sorry to hear about that, but I can't help you. I stopped having that problem ever since I used "laundry bags" for delicate garments.
Like sand? I haven't had that issue, however, I also don't wear it in dirt, or sandy situations. Does it actually feel like sand, or just look like sand? I occasionally get some white stuff on it from deodorant, but I rub it with a moist dark towel, and it comes right out. Not sure if you tried that, but I'd give that a shot. Other than that, I'm not really sure...
Not if you are buying a compression shirt. They are meant to be snug so order your normal size. I bought a total of 4 in my regular size and they fit as expected.
yes, just a little bit I guess!!!
Have several of these myself, but have no clue to the problem your having Brian. Possibly the detergent your using to wash them or maybe the way ther being dried. Aside from that don't know what to tell you , maybe try a different brand. I've had mine for over a year and luckily no issues other than their not as tight as they used to be.
Diameter 1.5", length just shy of 34". I have 14 of then in my cart bag, and they work perfectly; keeping club grips from catching each other. Clubs slide in and out easily.
NOt sure of actual diameter, but they fit into a 14 section bag fine. SOme you need to cut length down though.
One
two = 1 pair
Size 12 is Large.
i would have to say yes, they might be as much as 1/8" thick. i have the same issue with my riding boots - they are already kind of snug and the socks make them hard to zip up but they are warm!
I'm a 34C, and a 3 in bottoms and I got a medium. Top fits great and the bottoms are like what other people are saying- kind of baggy in the front. I would get a large
Get a medi. I would. Think.
Definitely large mediums way to small
Lightly padded. Does not show your nipples through the material.
Comfort-wise, they are very thin and lightweight. They wick away sweat very well but being so thin they may not have enough cushioning to be on your feet all day. They are extremely well made and will last a long time but I'm not absolutely sure they will suit your needs. I could recommend Under Armour or even Timberland socks that wick away sweat and provide a lot more thickness, so those might be more suitable for what you are looking for. :)
one pair
Medium is 6-8 Large is 10-12
just measured it and it is about 30 1/4".
Mine didn't come with them at all but it was pretty easy to do (: just know that the bottoms of the legs that flip face outwards and the washers go between the wood and screw
Two and a half feet. (30inches)
The top drawers are 2inches in depth and 4 1/2 in length by 7 1/2 wide. The three bottom ones are 12inches in length and about 7 1/2 wide and only 1 1/2 in depth. In other words none of them are very big can't fit that much stuff, I have a 5 yr old so she dosen't have much to put in there.
It's big enough for an adult to use
Yes that is the total weight. It is not heavy at all. It is all wood. My daughter uses it every day to do hair and make up for school and it has held up well. I am really happy with it.
It is white. I would highly recommend getting the same thing from ikea! It is about $100 more but better quality by far!
My granddaughter is 5. This vanity will last a lifetime if cared for. It is perfect for little girls and teens. You won't be disappointed. Its well made.
I bought one last summer and it came with everything needed to put it together, including screws. To tell you the truth, I don't remember instructions. My 15 yr old just started matching things up and we had it together in no time.
I'm 5'6 and there is enough space to fit legs. I think you should be fine
It would not be good for carrying jewelry around in a tote. The jewelry would definitely not stay put in the little compartments.
no - it is permanent - I've really liked this jewelry box. I got especially because I have a lot of silver jewelry and it prolongs the need to polish it.
It closes well and for the money is a nice piece. The shipping price is high.
It's a one size hat, it was/is WAY too Tight for Me. Wish I knew Where mine was, I'd sell You mine.
Some, but not all, of the shirts are offered in size small. Is there a design in particular you were wanting?
No, but the elastic band around the bottom of the hat will stretch to fit most heads.
Andrew, I believe that this hat has the velcro tab in back for adjustablity. I purchased this for my son and he loves it!
It can be used to hold your glasses in place. You can clip earrings through the holes in it or it can be used to elevate small objects you want to clean.
No there are no bubbles that I can see. There is a buzzing sound and waves in the water. I have found that it works well and use it for dentures and eye glasses.
I always use it, but if you have something that doesn't fit in it, you could skip the basket. Using the basket makes it easier to drain items as you pull them out.
I dont think so... because the gemstones can fall
the cleaning basket is 6 inches by 4 inches by2.25 inches. the machine is 8x6x5.5 my wife has put multiple pieces in it at the same time and it works well. well worth the price
I use mine for my glasses and just warm water and the results are good. It gets the corners clean and shiny. If it works well for glasses it seems it would be good for contacts also. However, perhaps checking with the manufacturer might be a good idea as I don't know the properties of your lens.
I can not find any warranty information in the manual. I would Google the manufacture information and contact them directly. I have had this unit for over two years and it works great.
yes. In researching it when I first bought it I found they do work for dentures too.
I don't know - the one they sent me is not the one shown in the picture. At this point I really don't recommend this kit - all the tools are very cheaply made and the kit they sent me had several unknown tools rather than the ones shown (from the picture: the back opener and the yellow thing (knife I think) and the black thing and the round thing are either different or not there, and they replaced the 3-prong back opener with a two prong model that's pretty hard to use)... Might not want to buy this kit. I'd send it back but then shipping (from and to) would cost me almost double what the kit is worth, so I'm stuck with it. Although I did buy a stand along three prong back opener that works pretty well... (off Amazon also - put in "watch back opening tool") - it barely does up to about (biggest) 4 cm back (41-42 mm). Worth the money. Called an "SE 88 Watch Wrench, adjustable in box, new"
No. Don't see how they could include "usage instructions" but a chart identifying tools by name would be nice!
When we got ours, my wife tried to use the link remover. It had the one pin attachment. However, the first 2 seconds she tried to use it, it broke.
hi i guess it depends on what your needs are as far as how involved you get in to repairs so choose the kit which best suites you the SEJT 6222 kit has a nice carry case and the tooles allowes me to remove watch cases, remove and replace battries,replace watch bands,if you need to go beond that choose a kit with more tools.
You come to my shop purchase the whole world to the
hi, my first thought was ,just like woolite,joy dish deterjent. but it does clean without building bubbles,and unlike other jewelry cleaners,you can use this with fine,gemstones or costume jewelry.although it does warn against cleaning porous or 'delecate' jewelry. this i believe ,is because it can also remove some of the 'glue' and therefore cause an item to 'brek' or come apart,i did this to a brooch(i cleaned 3 x in a row-super concentrated-i learned my lesson). however no ingredients are listed,quite likely it is a baking soda and borax,but possibly you can find out from manufacturer which is "blitz manufacturing company,inc. jeffersonville,in 47130. i hope this helps.
I bought it in a combo pack with an ultrasonic cleaner and it said no on glue and no composite or porous gemstones.
It worked on our silver rings and some other small items made of silver.
Please email us the size you prefer once you place order. Thanks
It is open down there, so it is really easy to go to the bathroom with no problems at all.
Well I bought a 2x and I can't even fit it up my leg but I'm a big girl. I have. Friend who tried it on she's in a size 16 and she couldn't put it on all the way she got her legs in it but that was all. The sizes run soooo small
leave your message in your order after you place order.
Hello, the size option may be not available due to the category the item is listed. Please email us your specific size after you make a purchase, thank you.
No
Sorry I can't be more helpful...I was new at using Amazon when I ordered it and couldn't find where to select the size either. I ended up submitting my order and actually just got the size I needed by mistake :/
How do order the extra size?
I have this same issue with the vagueness of these listings. It appears there are three sizes and one of the listings says to choose a size, but neither allows such. This is very frustrating. Unfortunately, this the only produc that seems likely to suit my needs (bamboo body suit/undies), so I am faced with risking receiving the wrong size forgoing it altogether. :-\
Yes they are "Crochless". Yes they are tight. The "Crochless" seams cuts into your thighs. I would not recommend this!
The medium would likely be too small for you unless you want this to be fitted snug to your body. I would recommend no smaller than the L and depending on how you want it to fit, maybe the XL.
The inside pocket is open, deep and made with not very resistant fabric. It is suitable to place documents, a thin and lightweight cell phone or a thin briefcase. Dimensions (Length x width): 25 cm x 10 cm (10 inch x 4 inch).
The size is larger than shown in the chart. I recommend buying a size smaller than the usual.
i wear this comfortably from 50 degrees on up
A very nice vest. Comfortable, light-weight, yet warming. I like all the pockets :-) For a xxl woman, I'd suggest a large size. Return policy is great, so no worries.
I have the Gravel which is more green than anything. It is not at all close to grey in color. I would describe it closer to sage or evergreen.
vest is trim fitting not baggy. size on this vest depends mostly on waist size. large probably fine for 34-36" waist.
No
I couldn't say exactly but that it's lightweight like the thin microfiber jackets. I'm a woman and bought this in a men's xsmall for fishing out on the lake... Works great.

No
No. I tried an adhesive tape, but it doesn't work well. I usually wear inside a normal bra, and find them more comfortable than my prosthetic. hope this helps.
A pair. Well worth it I might add.
Yes you get 2 of them as a set you get both boobs :) and there great I wear them for drag all the time I even tape them to my chest with lace front wig tape and they stay in and jiggle and everything
No you do not remove it. The form is a slimy mess otherwise. Do not tear or damage the film either as the form will become useless. If you do notice a small tear in the future I have used regular cellophane tape to cover the damage and that has worked well. Hope that helps.
Yes...have to use a strong bra to support
I am using one because of a Mastectomy and it has given me my full C. I would say yes it should work. I will warn you however that the breast forms are rather heavy and the nipple is VERY pronounced. In fact, I had to cut the nipple down because it made it difficult in wearing Tshirts. I tried a band aid but that did not work. I don't know if I would purchase this brand again because of the heaviness and nipples. Hope this helps.
this is two forms nicely made and conffy
Hi, I cant see why not. I'm about a full B cup naturally, and I fill out a C cup when I put them in. They should easily add to whatever you now have. I don't know how large to larger you are talking about or hopping for. I'm very happy with them. Good luck. ;-)
I am a cross desser, mine are 36 C and they are flat on the back. Mine fit great and I wear them all the time as they make feel very feminine.
no the polyurethane is the outer skin of this type of form.. higher end forms have outer surfaces that are more skin like, these are fairly low end of the spectrum... good for their intended purpose, if used under a full coverage bra.
as for as i know they work with any bra
Pairs. And they tend to run small for me.
It's a pair
Though I have never encountered the tear problem you mention, if I did I would buy CLEAR FLEXSEAL , and buy DOUBLE SIDE EASY RELEASE DRAFTING TAPE, tape off the area about the tear 1" on all edges, protect the rest of the surfaces with news paper cutout to limit overspray, then spray 3 or 4 very light coats over the repair area allowing the full cure time between coats. I have given up on breast forms because my goal was to have breasts that give me the feeling of natural breasts. All of the glues do not work. and damage the lining. I have finally grown my own Breasts. I was a 40 AA, and now I am a 40 D looking to take the cup size as far as I can before I go the next step to reduce belly fat so I will have both breasts and a waist.
size 6 fits a B - C cup & size 7 fits very nicely in a C cup I have both depending on what bra size i am wearing ......... a Soma 38 - C bra fits a size 7 perfectly ...i think if you wear a B cup ,,, go with the # 6 these are well made & very natural feeling Veronica ...
If you are using them for masectomy reasons there is a protective film on the back of the form that the instructions say to remove. This is OK to remove. The cover on the front and back of the form must stay in place. My problem was that I wanted to the feeling of natural breasts and could not find an adhesive that provided that feeling without destroying the form. Soooooo, I am growing my own. Be careful though because what you grow is permanent and you must be commited to live the rest of your life with your two new girlfriends. At this point I have gained about 2" in tissue height and doubled tissue mass in 3 weeks. If you are interested in growing real boobs try "flat2femme.com". It works !
Maybe 1- 2lbs... they are very full and they feel real. Love em'!
If you have a bra with a pouch to hold it in place
1 pair
About the size of both your hands together.
Actually, it's ingeniously designed so that it folds up in such a way that it stuffs into its own pocket! You'll never have hunt for the bag. :)
I am 5'8" and it comes to below my knees. The arms aren't quite long enough but the hood is almost too big but one certainly has plenty of coverage (except for my long arms). I carry my bag on my shoulder underneath the poncho and everything stays dry. Hope this helps.
I don't know because I returned it. It was not what I was looking for.
It was really hot during a summer rain storm at night. I had to take it off.
Fits me perfectly I am 5'3" and 170 pounds. It would be fine for someone smaller and larger -- all good! I like mine very much!
It's a lightweight nylon. Much better quality than the plastic ones that easily rip. I love mine!
The velcro panel is 2" high and 8" long.
They're about an inch and a half or two inches wide. About the same size as an average backpack or a military issue assault pack.
Model Number: 5031-O-BLK Size: Medium Dimensions: 20" x 14.5" x 8.5" Volume: 2,300 in Weight: 3 lbs 5 oz Material: 600-Denier Poly/Canvas
No
No its the flimsy one with the zippers that constantly get stuck. Get the bugout brand
I've had mine out prospecting in the rain several times and it seems to repel water pretty well. Over time, I'll just spray some Scotch Guard on it to maintain it's repellency if needed.
My husband has a 17.3 laptop which he carries in his without any problem. It doesn't come with padding to protect it though.
That's why the Velcro strip is there.
I purchased a heavier weave 2 inch webbing from a local supplier. Check your local outdoor supply store. This heavier weave also allowed for better waist belt performance.
An old Indian word, similar to vegetable and related to vegetarian, which means, "Bad Hunter".
No, the zipped pocket is a full size bill pocket. There is a clear slot on the outside, which can probably hold 1 or 2 cards, I use it for my work mag ID card. On the inside left are two side slots, which hold a max of about 4 cards each. In the middle is a clear slot for picture ID cards, which would probably hold 2 or 3 cards. On the right is a top slot in which I have 5 cards. Behind it, is the slot for the clear plastic sleeves, 4 in total, which probably would hold 2 cards each. Maximum would probably be about 25 cards, but I doubt it would close. I currently have about half that, including assorted cards, my driver's license, mag ID card, and a few paper cards. It's about an inch thick now, and barely closes, and certainly isn't flat. I don't carry in my back pocket anymore, and would certainly be uncomfortable sitting on this all day with all I have in it.
Yes, it does!
Yes and Yes. The Zipper opens up to another compartment.
It is on the OUTSIDE!!! The picture of the closed wallet would show it if they flipped it over. There's also one on the inside, which was OK with me.
3 inches about 5
About 3/8" to 1/2"
5" x 3" x thickness is dependant upon wealth (or amount of 'plastic') stuffed therein...
No there is no zippered compartment for coins .
I guess about 10. It is a little bigger than most Tri folds. I like the zippered bill area.
Depends on what you consider to be a credit card slot... But there are 6 slots large enough to fit a credit card, and on one side I've been able to fit about 12 cards. There is one angled pouch/slot on the right side when you open the wallet which I like to use for my credit card.
No, just the shirt. I'm pretty busty and wear a regular sports bra under with swim bottoms and that works well for support. I wouldn't wear alone because it wouldn't leave much to the imagination when wet.
I ordered a size Medium and the skin measures about 16 1/2 inches across the chest. This measurement was taken laying the shirt out flat not stretching it or wearing it. The size charts for O'Neill can be found on their website: http://shop.oneill.com/NL//sizechart/sizechart.cfm?gender=14#2 My bust measurement is 37 inch, I am 5'6" and I ordered a medium. I wanted a second skin feel and it does fit very tight, but this is what I was looking for. If I wanted something to fit a bit looser but not baggy I would have gone with a Large. I usually wear a size small t-shirt or blouse from regular stores like Gap, Banana Republic, J-Crew, etc. if that helps.
I don't know of anything that's chlorine proof, but I can say that I use mine almost daily in a public chlorinated pool and it lasts at least 6-9 months. I swim about 1 hour a day and so it gets a lot of use -- in fact my O'Neill Swim shirts last longer, and keep their elasticity better, than my bathing suits usually do. I wouldn't ever want to go without one.
No
I don't believe so, the reason I purchased is for sun protection.
I Wear 34a bra and usually buy S size. But orange color is very tight and denim color is loose. Because material is different. I think you'll take L size if you wanna denim color. Otherwise one size up~~
I wore it under my we suite since it is sleeveless. It helped keep my arms warm and it held its shape so far. I've used it three times and it was put in the dryer twice.
@HellCat, I'm not sure how comfortable you would be on a 300 plus mile ride because these are extremely form-fitting and fairly tight. I have one in black and it works great when I'm in the water but for hiking or other outdoor activities I would get a lighter color and possible size up so you have more "breathing" room. The sun protection is great, I'm very fair and haven't had a problem in that area. It's great for camping, swimming, diving, keeping bugs at bay but mine does retain some heat. These also dry fairly quick and are easy to clean. Hope this helps, have fun on your ride.
I'd definitely say yes! I've done a lot of laps in mine, and I've never felt cold.
Love them but need to order size larger than you ordinarily wear. I wear a ladies medium but order a rashguard in large.
No, just the shirt. I'm pretty busty and wear a regular sports bra under with swim bottoms and that works well for support. I wouldn't wear alone because it wouldn't leave much to the imagination when wet.

The size charts for O'Neill can be found on their website: http://shop.oneill.com/NL//sizechart/sizechart.cfm?gender=14#2 My bust measurement is 37 inch, I am 5'6" and I ordered a medium. I wanted a second skin feel and it does fit very tight, but this is what I was looking for. If I wanted something to fit a bit looser but not baggy I would have gone with a Large. I usually wear a size small t-shirt or blouse from regular stores like Gap, Banana Republic, J-Crew, etc. if that helps.
I don't know of anything that's chlorine proof, but I can say that I use mine almost daily in a public chlorinated pool and it lasts at least 6-9 months. I swim about 1 hour a day and so it gets a lot of use -- in fact my O'Neill Swim shirts last longer, and keep their elasticity better, than my bathing suits usually do. I wouldn't ever want to go without one.
No
I don't believe so, the reason I purchased is for sun protection.
I Wear 34a bra and usually buy S size. But orange color is very tight and denim color is loose. Because material is different. I think you'll take L size if you wanna denim color. Otherwise one size up~~
I wore it under my we suite since it is sleeveless. It helped keep my arms warm and it held its shape so far. I've used it three times and it was put in the dryer twice.
@HellCat, I'm not sure how comfortable you would be on a 300 plus mile ride because these are extremely form-fitting and fairly tight. I have one in black and it works great when I'm in the water but for hiking or other outdoor activities I would get a lighter color and possible size up so you have more "breathing" room. The sun protection is great, I'm very fair and haven't had a problem in that area. It's great for camping, swimming, diving, keeping bugs at bay but mine does retain some heat. These also dry fairly quick and are easy to clean. Hope this helps, have fun on your ride.
I'd definitely say yes! I've done a lot of laps in mine, and I've never felt cold.
Love them but need to order size larger than you ordinarily wear. I wear a ladies medium but order a rashguard in large.

I wore it under my we suite since it is sleeveless. It helped keep my arms warm and it held its shape so far. I've used it three times and it was put in the dryer twice.
@HellCat, I'm not sure how comfortable you would be on a 300 plus mile ride because these are extremely form-fitting and fairly tight. I have one in black and it works great when I'm in the water but for hiking or other outdoor activities I would get a lighter color and possible size up so you have more "breathing" room. The sun protection is great, I'm very fair and haven't had a problem in that area. It's great for camping, swimming, diving, keeping bugs at bay but mine does retain some heat. These also dry fairly quick and are easy to clean. Hope this helps, have fun on your ride.
I'd definitely say yes! I've done a lot of laps in mine, and I've never felt cold.
Love them but need to order size larger than you ordinarily wear. I wear a ladies medium but order a rashguard in large.
No, just the shirt. I'm pretty busty and wear a regular sports bra under with swim bottoms and that works well for support. I wouldn't wear alone because it wouldn't leave much to the imagination when wet.
I ordered a size Medium and the skin measures about 16 1/2 inches across the chest. This measurement was taken laying the shirt out flat not stretching it or wearing it. The size charts for O'Neill can be found on their website: http://shop.oneill.com/NL//sizechart/sizechart.cfm?gender=14#2 My bust measurement is 37 inch, I am 5'6" and I ordered a medium. I wanted a second skin feel and it does fit very tight, but this is what I was looking for. If I wanted something to fit a bit looser but not baggy I would have gone with a Large. I usually wear a size small t-shirt or blouse from regular stores like Gap, Banana Republic, J-Crew, etc. if that helps.
I don't know of anything that's chlorine proof, but I can say that I use mine almost daily in a public chlorinated pool and it lasts at least 6-9 months. I swim about 1 hour a day and so it gets a lot of use -- in fact my O'Neill Swim shirts last longer, and keep their elasticity better, than my bathing suits usually do. I wouldn't ever want to go without one.

I have not found anything as nice as this one that has stationary dividers. However, if you don't need anything fancy, maybe try one of those plastic containers for jewelry pieces in arts & crafts? I have used those in the past and they work very nicely - especially for travel. I think I bought mine at Walmart and it snapped securely shut with compartments for many pairs of earrings.

There are 24 squares on the top tray that are 1.5"W x 1.5"L x 1"H. The bottom row has 24 squares that are mostly 1.5"W x 1.5"L x 1.5"H. The whole box is 10.5"W x 7.5"L x 4"H. Then there is also a bungee material that spans across the back of the lid under a small mirror. You can put bracelets and what not in there. Overall, I love this jewelry box. I use it for hoop earrings, post earrings, and clasp earrings. For my hook earrings I created a earring holder using a large craft store frame backed with that decretive screening that goes over furnaces. I got that from Home Depot. Since I make a lot of my own jewelry, I have a ton and needed to have a place for all the non hangable post things and small bracelets.
It's sort of a light tan chamois color, soft and chamois like.
You have to go to www.tigerclaw.com, the manufacturers and there is a size chart somewhere on there that I used! but these run weirdly. I am 5'4" and weigh 135 and I got a size 4 which fit fine to give you something got compare to.
The pants come in sizes, but they are not typical pants sizes. There is a chart you look at and use the size you normally wear in jeans (ie, 34 for men), and it will tell you what "size" you need in these pants. I technically should have had a size 4, but after seeing that others were saying they were too small, I ordered 6s instead and they were perfect. So just order the size up from what their chart says you should wear, and you should be fine.
http://www.martialartsmart.com/size-chart.html
I also am interested in these pants but I am not sure of the sizes either.
They run very, very big. I use them for T'ai chi class, so it's okay, but I had to take them up 8" in length, and they're still big in width, you could fit two of me in them! We're about the same height and weight.

This is my second Marmot jacket. The first, which I still keep as a spare in my car, lasted about seven years before the inside lining started to show wear.
no lining. a single layer of water proof material. but since no lining it folds up big enough to put in your pocket, and is completely waterproof.
The material is too thick to cleanly pack into a pocket like a poncho would. I've rolled it like a shirt and stored it in my luggage that way, and it doesn't take up as much room as a regular shirt would but it's not a ultrathin jacket. It doesn't have any thick or rigid parts. For me the trade off was the super-thin jackets tended to not be as water resistant, as I've had an LL Bean jacket that got humid on the inside even with a little bit of rain.
i bought this jacket to endure the humid rainy season here in the Philippines. Lightwt material and pit zips make it perfect for my situation. Not too warm.
China....where else.
True to size I would say. I have a Large Tall. I'm 6'2" and have long arms.
Yes the hood will roll up in the collar.
Yes. 100% waterproof. Thru hike approved
Very tough fabric while still being lightweight.
It provides a respectable amount of warmth for what it is (a rain jacket, not a coat). Throw on a couple layers under this jacket and you're good to go. I've worn this in non-rain, less than 40 degree (F) conditions and it's kept me warm with some layering.

compression
No
Several shades darker than white...the color of coffee with triple cream. Hazelnut creamer is almost the exact shade. Put white tee over it...warm, soft.
Under Armour for men carries several cuttings, compression being the tightest, fitted is more comfortable fitted, and loose fit something.
Tactical means the logo is not white/stands out. If you have black tactical compression or fitted the under armour logo will match the color of the item and not stand out.

Sizing is true, but remember, Charged Cotton has Lycra (or a generic stretch fiber) so it will somewhat conform to your body. Also there is "loose" and "fitted" Charged Cotton, the latter fits the body much snugger than the "loose fit".
The tag on the shirt I received says "LOOSE" (vendor was Outdoor Inc). I was hoping for regular (based on the comments here), but everyone was guessing instead of checking the label.
I have the same opinions as you regarding 100% cotton and 100% synthetic....I have found the UA "charged cotton" shirt pretty much answer both complaints! If I am anticipating at full out cardio "sweat" workout I prefer the UA "vented" hot gear shirts...they really work well. Otherwise...I am just sold on the "charged cotton" shirts. Great, comfortable top for lifting or stretching workouts. Plus I have found that they are my go to shirt for just bumming around town or going for hikes/walks. They are replacing my other cotton-Ts! Hope this helps.
yes
For me they are fitted around the shoulders and arms (I bought large and have 15" arms) and slightly loose around the waist.
No.. it came with round neck shape same as shown in the photo
You guessed it....China!! I got 2 shirts and two shorts, all from China. They are very well made, good fabric, comfortable to work out hard in, and I'm pleased with the product, even if not made in USA.
I believe so. I bought an XL the first time and found it a little baggy, second time I bought a L and fits perfectly. I'm 6'1" 225lbs.
As far as I know they are the regular fit. From my perspective they are not tight or binding.
I would say it fits true to size. Not small. And it doesn't shrink

Great, comfortable top for lifting or stretching workouts. Plus I have found that they are my go to shirt for just bumming around town or going for hikes/walks. They are replacing my other cotton-Ts! Hope this helps.
yes
For me they are fitted around the shoulders and arms (I bought large and have 15" arms) and slightly loose around the waist.
No.. it came with round neck shape same as shown in the photo
You guessed it....China!! I got 2 shirts and two shorts, all from China. They are very well made, good fabric, comfortable to work out hard in, and I'm pleased with the product, even if not made in USA.
I believe so. I bought an XL the first time and found it a little baggy, second time I bought a L and fits perfectly. I'm 6'1" 225lbs.
As far as I know they are the regular fit. From my perspective they are not tight or binding.
I would say it fits true to size. Not small. And it doesn't shrink
Sizing is true, but remember, Charged Cotton has Lycra (or a generic stretch fiber) so it will somewhat conform to your body. Also there is "loose" and "fitted" Charged Cotton, the latter fits the body much snugger than the "loose fit".
The tag on the shirt I received says "LOOSE" (vendor was Outdoor Inc). I was hoping for regular (based on the comments here), but everyone was guessing instead of checking the label.

Did you remove the plastic tab in the battery slot? If so, you may have bad batteries. Otherwise just push the button on the light module to choose the light pattern. Good luck!
There is no problem using with adult shoes ; just don't tighten to much !
I bought these a few months ago..they are a pair of laces.
No
I do not recommend this product
I don't know the limit but it's at least 50 lbs.
yes, and KG also. User selectable
Yes! It weights in pounds, ounces, grams and kilograms. There is a button next to the power button where you can choose the unit you would like to use. Totally worth it, it's an awesome product!
You can try this discount code:IQUTGMIO
Sorry the scale do not have any information about where it's made but work really good
when flipped over...from the inside of each front wheel...it's about 7cm. And the distance from a front wheel to a back wheel is about 4 cms.
Plastic
No, it's just a cheap plastic push around toy.
This would be a great backpack for school. I carry tools in mine to work every day and it holds up fine. Can't beat the Badlands warranty
18 high, 11 wide, 8 deep
It does have a pocket for the bladder as well as a center hook to hang the bladder and an opening for the tube
My guess is yes... I have only carrried about 25 pounds so far.... seems pretty tough
My pack has mossy oak break up camo,,, I'm sure it's the same as the one you're looking at. Great pack by the way
Yes, the two straps on the front can be used to attach a bow. But keep in mind that this pack has no real meat hauling capacity. If you are looking for a good stand pack, or day pack this is an excellent choice. If on the other hand you want a pack that can also help you haul out an animal, look at the 2200 or the sacrifice.
Excellent -- It's a really robust mesh woven over a firm, ventilated and ribbed padding on both the back and shoulder straps.
Yes, the pack has a ribbed padding covered in mesh that rests against your back. The pack is very comfortable. I carried it on a walk hunt in the mountains of West Texas for several miles.
Yes. The gift was for my dad and as i recall there were lots of straps to tie things to
It's Mossy Oak Break Up
Oh yeah, that and more. My bag holds all of that plus 2 pairs of Muy Thai gloves, practice rattan, head gear and 2 pairs of MMA gloves
It's solid on the bottom.
Yes is does have a shoulder strap, and it is a beefy one.
Yes
My nephew attends tae kwon do lessons and I stuff the bag with training pads helmet, face guard, foot pads, gloves. Plus sparing gloves, practice mits, towel as well as uniform. It all fits in there with room to spare. Nephew is five years old. Size of equipment may take up more room but there is plenty of volume in the bag left.
NOTHING IS MENTIONED ABOUT SKYDIVING IN THE MANUAL... Just as good for skydiving as any watch... it is not made specially for that.
Except a compass, not really. Those watches have a larger display(case) and are a bit tougher. The sensors are s the ame as far as i know. The price difference makes this a no brainer unless you rely need a watch with a compass.
5 alarms but no snooze I just space them out 5-10 mins.
A few
There is a one-year warranty from Casio on the watch. Casio America 800-706-2534 might help you.
Yes no problem
Yes. But it ticks every 10 seconds.
Not sure. Looks plastic. I only wear it on hikes or camping. Not a watch guy myself, just needed the altimeter and thermometer. I may have wrote this before yet the idea of a thermometer on your body stills cracks me up. Just -15 degrees Fahrenheit and it's actually spot on.
According to Casio this is 18mm band I Recommend purchasing at a walmart They even replace for free sometimes
I cannot even set it. The instructions are too complicated so it is totally worthless to me.
I don't know... My son is about 5'9" with a 38 waist, and my husband is 6'3" with a 40" waist, and they both fit in the xl.
Assembled in Mexico of U.S made components. I hope this helps.
120 cm equals 47 inches. I'm a small size 28-30 waist. I would suggest xl size if not xxl size.
probably medium. i got an xl for my 38 inch waist
It's not a waffle type but it does have a kind of vertical texture. It does seem to work like a dry fit material but its not skin tight. It will stretch out quite a bit if undersized. Some say its not a good base layer because it is not skin tight. I find it insulates well, wicks moister, breaths, and is not restrictive. This material will collect lint and you will get fabric pilling over time. But its an undergarment and that doesn't bother me. It does help to wash on gentle. And never put in dryer under any heated setting, it will melt. Dries quickly on a hanger.
I'm 5'11 and 32x34 and the Medium was good roomy fit. You migh want to go with Large.
Yes
No, An elastic waist band
I am not sure if he would have room under the football pants.
XL works great for me
I say 3 ft
Yes, but, not a lot. There is a corner under the lid of the unit. Maybe it fits 9 or 10 rings.
Yes the top drawer is divided into 6 equal compartments. My wife really loves hers.
Yes, it does
I have a 36 inch waist and a large is very comfortable for me. I would assume that an extra large would fit 38 to 44 inches.
Yes two side pockets no rear and no liner so wear undies or you'll have sweat spots otherwise I live en.

Yes
Yep. Nice and sturdy
YES
I so like these sunglasses! Way better than cheap plastic crap that you find in sporting good stores and even sun glass hut but! They aren't Serengeti or Maui Jim! However I think they are almost as good glass as Ray Ban!.....they are not! Polarized!
Yes, also includes cleaning cloth
I just put two or three drops of blue Dawn dish soap in the water. Seemed to sparkle items quite well.
There is a max line inside. I pour in my cleaning solution first, then water. I lower the basket with item to be cleaned. At the face of the cleaner you have a timed desire button. Select your time and press start. Warning. If you need to clean items a second time it is suggested to wait at least 15 minutes before restart.
No. Sadly it cannot be removed.
This one plugs into the wall and uses AC power. No batteries.
I have never turned mine in for longer than 6 mins at a time. The motor on these things seems awfully small for extended use.

Hi there. If the unit is working you will see the little dimples on the surface of the water if you look at it in the light at the right angle. With this model, any heat generated is transducer heat, a byproduct of running unit. Unlike other units that are "supposed" to heat up, this unit does not have a built in heater.... It simy heats up from continued use. It is supposed to have an overload protection, or temperature sensor which will shut down unit with excessive heat. For example, I would occasionally used hot or warm water in the unit to improve cleaning, only to realize that eventually the unit would temporarily stop working. After cooling down, it would start working again. I am unfamiliar with the vitamin process you are using it for, so I'm not sure what conditions the unit must operate under for you to get the results you are looking for. If heat is needed, you may be better off with a heated unit. If you are simply wondering whether or not it is working based on heat produced, tbat won't necessarily be a good indicator. When cleaning something such as eyeglasses, for example, you will see what looks like "smoke" coming off of the eyeglasses or other object.... This is dirt, oils, etc. being cleaned off. Also, you will notice those little dimpmes in the water. Another was I would tear my unit was to put a fingertip on the water.... I would see the " smokey" appearance around my finger as the oils were cleaned from my finger.... Along with a little pain if I had a hangnail or cut! This unit leaked wayer into it from poor sealing between stainless steel tup and upper part of unit, and failed within less than a year. There are better units for not much more money. I would not recommend this unit for more than occasional use. I paid about $30 for the unit, and have seen the units vary in price from $19 to over $50, so that's a consideration, as well. Hope this helps.
No
Yes. Rings, bracelets, necklaces, earrings.
Soak in Hydrogen Peroxide. Should foam some of the gack off. Then ultrasound with rubbing Alcohol. Should clean and sterilize the pieces.
EF-305 uses CASIO Part #10447496 which we sell on Amazon.
This band will NOT fit the EF552 models as those have a completely different Lug and band widths.
Nop, It comes wider that the model you are asking for.
I don't know because I used on EFA-131 Sorry
This model band fits model EFA109
Yes it's a good strap make sure you get the right size
This band would fit Casio watch model EFA109 but of course, Amazon provides a vague description of the product.
I think not. is different. I know the original is different. regards
No they are not
I've recently used these gloves in the mid 20s F and I could definitely feels a minor chill. Later had a cold spell of 8 F with wind chill and my hands were freezing in less than 5 minutes. This was in NYC weather. I just bought lightweight primaloft gloves which handles the same 8 F and with less expense.
The website has a sizing chart.. here is the link. http://www.heritagegloves.com/GloveChart.html
Yes. The ones I received had both. Of note, the zippered pouch places the hand-warmer by the back of your hand. To me, the hand-warmer would work better if it was by the palm. And, while I really liked the look, feel, and fit of these, I was very disappointed in their ability to keep my hands warm. For warmth, I was much happier with the "Auclair Duck Down Gloves - Waterproof, Insulated gloves" which I found at SierraTradingPost.com (unsure if available at Amazon), but these lacked both features you're asking about.
Order at least a size bigger, even two from YOUR measure .. They were tight on me and I ordered my size according to their chart -- really tight. When I asked them about doing an exchange they told me they could not because they weren't carrying this style anymore ..... So tread carefully :)
Yes, if you get the correct size.
I just found http://www.justridinggloves.com/. They are linked from "Online Retailers" page on Heritage Gloves website - http://www.heritagegloves.com/OnlineRetailers2.html It looks like they have standard shipping at $0. I'm not sure if this will change based on location.
The gloves are very grippy on the steer wheel. I've been using them for driving the last two weeks and they are great for that. They may be a little bulky for reaching into your pants pocket unless you have very roomy pockets. I'm able to reach into my coat pocket for my keys without any problems. I don't think you can go wrong with these gloves.
By design, gloves are inefficient at retaining heat. If your hands are continually cold in winter, try mittens. Having all digits together will keep them warmer. Gloves isolate digits in sleeves. Increased surface area inherent to a glove's form, by definition, loses more heat than a mitten would.

The one I have is 7" long, 3.25" wide.
I think it was Velcro. I didn't keep it as it was much larger than I expected so didn't suit my purpose in buying it.
Yes - it is not a hard shell case.
yes, it is soft, no inside frame, no inside hard plastic, just naugahyde or similar fake leather
No that's about the height of my little brother and it fit him just fine
Yes it is.
Hi ,We have not the XXL
it depends on your proportions, I am 5'7" and weigh roughly 230 pounds and it fits just fine. albeit a little tight around my butt
Mine did come with a hood ^__^
No I baught it as a hood and I didnt get a hood. But it is still a nice robe
that's what im thinking cuse when they had asked me something the seller I couldt respond when I tryd it never whent threw so im gessing its one size my waist is on the larger side so I piced the 3x wich fite me but no I cant even close it around my self
The size I purchased was an XL & it fits my 6 ft 175 lb son perfectly. Depending on height of person is where the length will be. I believe this costume could fit a guy comfortably about up to 200 lbs or so.
I think it wod fit
it has a hood, but its not the length of the robe its a hoodie not a robe.... at least the one I got from this :(
go to janets closet dot com, good videos on that
They come as a pair.
How long have you them, my first pair that I bought else were are about 6 months old and have not discolored at all.the 2 other pair I have are 2 months old and are not discolored either. Is the skin torn? You my have a bad set if you got them from Amazon call them and let them know.
Yes
I would think so. I bought them for a woman who had a full mastectomy. Beyond that I would ask the seller.
no
The price is for the pair.
something to do with sizing them. Go to their web site and search on sizes JA
I remember I looked in a web page of the clip brand and there you can download all the shapes they have and the actual measures of each. After you found the shape and exact measure of your frames you write the item number to chech if Amazon has it available. That is what I did and worked very well. Good luck!
More gray.
I will try to get them from my grandson who is 9 and slender... not skinny just not above slender.... he was wearing 8-10 when I ordered and the site said that's small... noo small is way to small.... ordered the medium and it fits perfectly... these run very small compared to clothes usually buy so I'd buy at least one size up.... even my seven year old couldn't fit the small... so the 8 and 10 both wrong.... we were satisfied with the medium... the price is right and the quality was comparable to the more expensive ones you buy from Dick's and other sporting goods stores good luck
I got them for an adult daughter--about 5'4"--who had her leg in a huge cast. I don't have them to measure. Sorry
these run very small for size description given... the medium fits my 9 year old grandson who is about 4'6" or 7" and he weighs only about 85 pounds I think you would need to go up at least two sizes
These were a gift for someone
the ones I got and had to return ran very small for their size. I would say go up one or even two sizes... but they also run more toward lean kid... if got any kinda size that's not thin, you might have a problem... going up in size to fit body will prob make legs long....
Feels like a heavy nylon. I have no complaints about mine.

Yes the outside is waterproof, I've been caught inthe rain numberous occasions, and nothing inside ever got wet. It's a great bag, I love mine, hope this helps.
Yes it does
Soft side. It doesn't stand on its own. I love mine. Use it every day for school.
The inside of the blue plaid one is black or very dark grey.
The bag does have extra cushioning on one side of it (to protect a laptop) but it is not insulated.
Definitely - I have wiped mine frequently and it looks perfect. Buy it - you will not be sorry!
Answer here...i used it on vacation and it worked well :)

Soft side. It doesn't stand on its own. I love mine. Use it every day for school.
The inside of the blue plaid one is black or very dark grey.
The bag does have extra cushioning on one side of it (to protect a laptop) but it is not insulated.
Definitely - I have wiped mine frequently and it looks perfect. Buy it - you will not be sorry!
Answer here...i used it on vacation and it worked well :)

Don't buy these; they are cheaply made and don't work at all... I returned mine. Go for the wooden ones, in my opinion
Yes. They would work well as plain old shoe trees. They do not work as shoe stretchers.
it means 2 pieces, and I wouldn't waste my money on them, they do not work!!!!
13.75 x 9.5 x 1.5 The inside "foam" is about 1.25 inches high. These are not to the 16ths but very close. If you need an exact for a location and these are very close, let me know.
Yes. It's a sheet of velvet-covered foam with slits to put rings, cuff links, etc. It is also quite sturdy.
about fifty
No it is precut. And not deep enough to hold rings of any real size
It's about 1" inside and 1 1/4" outside. My wife loves hers. Only complaint is pearl paint is wearing off pearls in contact with her neck. Still wears them though and gets compliments, go figure.
14 inches from clasp to circle.
You hang them on the circular bit. Much easier the the traditional chains. One arm goes through . Then you close them. If that makes sense .
The arm of your glasses slid through the hole that you see in picture and hang down from there. It works great but my 6 month old granddaughter got her foot caught in it and it spilled beads all over. I need to purchase another one.
It doesn't - the side piece of your glasses goes through the circle, fold your glasses and the glasses lay nicely. You take the glasses out of the hoop and replace when you're done reading.
Around 6 in. Veery nice my wast is 34 and the xl fit great
I ordered two pairs at different times and they both came on hangers. 1 per package on a hanger
A couple is two. A few is 2 or more.
Not flex 360 ones
Read the description.
It containes 2 pieces
I've worn them with no problems.
Just one pair. I have found they are no different than the adidas Men's Sport Performance Climalite 2-Pack Boxer Briefs of which I have bought 6 or 8 pairs off Amazon and absolutely love. The price on the 2 pack Climalite goes up and down between $18-24 on a daily basis. Get the climalite to get 2 pairs instead of the single pair of 360 for the same price.
Black and Red......Is what I got. Nice pair of underwear.

Yes. I had it engraved on the back.
Approximately one inch wide and tall
My necklace included several stickers with medical conditions on them that you could place on the back of your heart necklace. You just needed to pick which one best suited your condition.
no, this item would have to be custom engraved. I have them available for engraving at medaboutyou2 (dot) (com)
Yes by pushing the bottom left button until you see the date at the bottom of the watch when you are in time mode.
Yes

Made in China
The manual features Chinese instructions.
The case is 50 cm
Suunto's watches are terrible. I have this watch which broke after 9 months. They charged me to fix it. Get anything else
some do the same things the strap is wider ,different back grounds to see better there all good,pick the one you like and and hit buy.
If you go to the Suunto website you will see the differences you can compare models by features, it has to do with the features. I remember doing the same. The Suunto Core does all of them or it has more features in regards to what I needed. I think the Military does one thing though the Core doesn't. Hope it helped.
I never used this pocket for water bottle,but you can put the 2 liter bottle.I don't know if this is comfortable ,but the pocket is big.
Jansport backpacks come with lifetime warranties directly from Jansport.
Yes it is.
It is water resistant to some extent. If its like a heavy storm, you have a good 5 minutes until the insides of the bag get wet. However, if you like accidentally spilled water on the bag it should be fine.
Mine is about that size and it fits good :-)
China
It has some padding. It is also a very big pack. It will fit a lot of books in addition to the laptop.
Bag itself might be slightly big, but straps can adjust to you height so not a big deal.

I don't know very much about embroidery, but the fabric is your basic canvas with some coating material so I would think that it would be okay for hand embroidery, but might not be sturdy enough for machine embroidery. The dimensions were a little smaller than I anticipated, so designs would have to be fairly small.

25 1/2" (The section behind the doors only) x 12" Deep. Legs are 5 1/2" tall. The whole unit is 38 1/2" Tall.
The large drawer is very deep. The open area above the 4 drawers can hold wide bangles and bracelets. The open area above the drawers is deep and great for small handbags or jewelry boxes. It's very low to the ground.
drawers
There are 4 drawers inside, each drawer is 2 inches deep and 12 inches across. The bigger drawer on the bottom is 5 1/2 in depth and 16 inches in length. It holds all my jewerly, watches and scarves. My husband even has room for his collection of watches. I've been really happy with this purchase, so much so that I may end up getting one for my adult daughter for Christmas because she loves it too.
Yes it is all wood. Inside the drawers are lined w/ a black felt over the wood
19 1/2 inches
the top has lot's of room for rings. There is one drawer that is 4 small boxes & the other are all in one & go from small to big. Sides have lot's of room for neckles. You will in joy this I'm sure
Yes
3 double hooks each side
Yes it does. On both sides.
I'm sure there is some vaneer; however, I can tell you it is made well and is very sturdy. My daughter loves it.
Yes, both of the sides open and have 3 double hooks, so you have 6 places to hang necklaces on each side. Be careful hanging metal ones on the outer hooks, sometimes they will catch in the magnet used to keep the doors closed. Not a big deal, but something to pay attention to. I love mine!!
Yes it does.
Yes it does.
necklaces are in side the door & you got lot"s of room in joy as it is very nice I just love mine
It has a button fly.
i believe most have adjustable waist, i looked on tru-specs website for sizing. the true-spec 24-7 series are way better than the basic bdu pant.
If you want them snug go with a S/L if you want a little extra room go for the M/R, the waist is adjustable.
Med / Reg
36 30
I believe tru-spec has a size chart on their website
Google is your friend. That's how I figured it out. http://www.chiefsupply.com/resources/sizingchart/truspec.html
That would be a Large Long or LL.
I am seeing a large size.what is the lengthis this regular
These are great simple and durable. Dimensions are in the description of product. They fit just perfect. I just recently traveled with it and it is serving well.
Yes, it opens, it is like a book cover. However, the inspectors usually take one page out of the cover so that they can scan the bar code. They have to do this for all covers. This one protects the passport, good simple product.
There are 5 in each order
It has folds inside thst act as sleeves or like a book cover would work
Top to bottom a shade under 5" (5 3/4" if you include the point on top of the dome) Roughly 3 1/4" diameter on the bottom. Overall the device works as expected, the painting seems to be hand done, however the materials used to manufacture the carousel are not ideal. My 3 year old broke a horse off fairly easily so if you expect your children to spend an elongated time using/ playing with this item I would recommend something more durable.
I believe it's a resin, or some such compound. It's not porcelain.
IT'S TURN KEY
I think thats about right--i mostly bought it for decoration. Sometimes ill wind it up a little for my daughter but wasnt really timing it but did notice it stops after about 10 seconds. Honestly its not something alarming to me--i think it works fine, it just has a short play period. Its still enough to amuse my daughter though and not long enough to annoy me so it works for us.
I'm sorry, I didn't run it long. I turned it on for a short while and then put it back in it's box, as it was a gift.
Yes it does.. rotates slowly..it is so cute !!
Sorry, we do not have this tune
The cost will be $20 if you get 2, you can place an order first, we will refund you the additional cost.
No
Yes but they are VERY small
The are 8" tall
I bought the very small ones. They most definitely strong enough to possibly plant herbs in. Strawberries need much more soil to grow. However, I would plant herbs in them.
In a camp setting we used chunky foam stamps with craft paint ammended with textile medium and after the bags dried, we ironed according to directions to set the paint. It worked well and the kids enjoyed the craft project.
Yes the demensions are pretty accurate
Yes, I used acrylic paint on sponges to "stamp" sea animals on mine. They looked great.
I hope that's a joke
yes
If iron doesn't stuck, try fabric glue. I used fabric glue on the felt monkey heads I put on the ones I bought & they are still attached after 2 years. I put a piece of cardboard between the 2 sides.
They're a muslin-type fabric... I was able to do iron-ons on them.
My tactical pants were XL - 39" - 43" waist.
If you are 72" or under, I strongly advise against a L/L, unless you have unusually long legs. Without boots or shoes the cuffs sit at my heels, or actually under them. A L/R should fit a six- foot person just right.
The tag says made in Honduras from materials from the USA.
They are velcro
yes
I am a 34-32 and the regular size fits me perfectly.

I have a 6" wrist and there is still an additional two holes to tighten the wrist band. So it would shorten the wrist band a 1/2" more. Not sure if the band could handle additional holes as it is a rubber like material.
I'm not aware that it will track calories burned, however, it is a great heart rate watch.
I just checked and it does not measure in KM. Only miles
The Battles you participated in,.
Yes
No
I'm not 100% sure. Keep in mind I'm a man. XL barely fit my wife (36D). A M might be tight, a L might be a little loose. I'm a man, I'd say go with the tighter one, but a L might be more comfortable. don't go with a small.
fits a 38DDD and works just fine.
small
not sure.... but it 'does' lift really well..
medium is good for 34 sized
How tall are you? Depends if you blouse them using blousing cords or tuck them in your boots with or without the velcro tape to hold them in place. If you tuck them in than yeah they should be fine cause they wont pop out of your boots even if you have that velcro blouse thing. I stopped doing that a long time ago. I would not recommend that for myself because the Long versions really are long. Stick with the Medium regulars.
Button
Well, as far as I know there shouldn't be any issues. Good luck!
Yes and yes.two front pockets,two rear,two cargo and two calf.remember to get the shorter length if you are using high leg boots so the calf pockets hang right!
Different manufacturers have different names for their products I find the easiest way to tell the difference is by just looking closely at the color. They all have that same digital design it's the colors that have Suttle differences. Hope that helps you! Aloha!
For me I got a Median reg and it said that they were poly/cotton when I ordered them, but when I got them there was a patch sown into the right rear pocket and is labeled as 50/50 nylon/cotton.
I'd suggest M/R (medium waist, regular length) if you like your ACU to be a bit loose -or- S/R if you want it tighter. But honestly you should get a tape measure and check your actual waist/inseam and pick from the very wide range of fit options and ACU /BDU has to offer. Good luck.
You should be good with a MR.
Just similar
The pants have a string tie so just go with the size u feel comfortable with and even if there a smidge big you can tighten them
You can switch out the photo.

Yes
It is painted wood.
About 3"x10"....it's really nice
It plays the Schubert Ave Maria.
I can't answer, I gave them at gifts last year. The little girls love it.
No clue. Gave as a gift to someone iut of town but was happy with it
I don't know
The box is 6 by 10 inches
Hi - it is a wooden box very nice quality
We are not able to personalize this item. Thank You for visiting our Amazon Store. European Imports & Gifts
It looks to be about 8 x 6 x 2.25
yes. rolls up to hide if not needed.
Same size just worded different.
I wear a medium and found that the large size is just right to fit over work clothes.
Two large mesh pockets on the inside.
No. Just a rain jacket.
I'm 5'10" 165lbs and bought a large so I could where a bulky sweatshirt or fleece underneath. The sizing chart is accurate - go by that. BTW, I bought the Gage rain suit and it has been the best rain protection I have ever had, including L.L. Bean.

As I recall the key and cloth were inside the box, but mine wasn't locked. You do have to pinch both sides in for it to open. If you are doing just one it won't open. I would suggest getting in touch with Amazon or the company that sent it. You should get a replacement. Mine works great!
14 1/2" x 8 1/4"
I do not lock my ring case so I will never need a replacement key. Not sure if the supplier offers the option to replace a key.
I would do a small and a medium. The are long even with the straps adjusted. If your girls are tall for their age go up a size.
My son is a tall 8 year old (4'6" +) and we ordered the medium, and it fits great. A little long in the legs at first, but the adjustable straps allowed me to cinch it up so they fit well. Hope this helps.
You will need to get an adult small I am 5 ft 5 in and 130 pounds and that size was perfect for me. My son is 5ft and 90 pounds and he got a kids xl
Small is 5/6, Med 7/8, Lg 9/10
My son is 13 and he wore the large he is 5ft and weighs and 90lbs. He normally wears a kids xl or adult small, so these do run a little big. I would say the small is for a child that is around 50lbs a size 8/10
Medium fits someone that weighs anywhere from 140 to 160. Average size person size small is for 5'7 and under

Yes, but make sure you have the camera in case as there is not much padding in the purse. I recently went through airport security with a full water bottle because I forgot it was in there! It holds a ton of stuff without feeling like it does.

The back of the keychain has "Captain America" and "Marvel Inc." engraved already, so there isn't much space if u wanna add some engraving. IMO, even without any engraving it certainly reflects the key-holder's superior taste [:D] and is quite unique.
There were two keychains issued: the first version/edition has Captain America across the front of the SHIELD. The second edition does not.
each seller is different. often when sellers have a super low price they charge shipping for each item. other sellers charge shipping by weight. other sellers jack up the price of their item and offer free shipping on their items. just add items to shopping cart and start checkout to see combined shipping cost. if you don't like it, go add the items from a different seller and try again

Once Upon A December is the song just like the movie. It is very detailed and beautiful.
It play the whole melody to song when you wind it up completely but no sining just melody
This one doesn't come with the necklace but I've seen it sold separately here on Amazon and with this same musicbox on ebay as well. Necklace ain't that pretty though
Yes, it comes in a purple cardboard box
I've never heard any grinding noise from the music box. My family owns several San Francisco music boxes and I've never heard any of them make a grinding noise. Now, much cheaper music boxes we have make grinding noises but never one from this company.
It does not. You can buy the music box along with the necklace from the musichouseshop (http://www.musichouseshop.com/cgi-musichouseshop/sb/productsearch.cgi?search_field=anastasia&storeid=*1eda7bd55e144bcd1ce094a6ce9ec4ae43) However, the necklace does not interact with the music box. The music box has a key for winding it on the bottom.
yes, it was in the original box.
Not like in the movie, there's a standard jewelry box crank on the bottom of the box that's hidden by the base.
Heavy plastic outside inside glass frame metal music inside a mix of metal plastic and glass
It's both a sling and a two strap backpack. There is a zipper that runs along the strap that can separate it into two straps for wearing it as a backpack, or just zip it up to make a single strap. It should be noted that the strap when zipped is just long enough to sling over one shoulder and not across the body.
I'm not familiar with how big a regular I pad is, If you could give me an idea on how large the I pad is I could better answer your question. My daughter has a Kindle Fire and I hold it for her all the time when we're out, do you know if your I pad is the same size as the Kindle Fire?
It is dark brown, not at all what this picture shows
Yes. "A" change of clothes but nothing fancy. Roll up everything and no shoes. Shorts and Tees are best. It's a great bag.
Yes there are buckles that adjust the length!
No...however, it comes with extra links and is easily modified! I like it a lot and have received many positive comments about it! In a previous comment modification was found difficult. This is absolutely absurd! All you need is a push pin, a small hammer or something else to tap with, a pair of pliers, and a little ingenuity! A clue...observe the arrows on the removable links! Enjoy!
It is the bracelet only, you have to buy the ipod apart.
Yes

Sorry. I have the old style square Nanoipod & it's perfect for that. I don't know the shape of smart watches.

I think no, this band hasn't the standard attach way, just a hole in the bottom to the iPod clamp
No...however, it comes with extra links and is easily modified! I like it a lot and have received many positive comments about it! In a previous comment modification was found difficult. This is absolutely absurd! All you need is a push pin, a small hammer or something else to tap with, a pair of pliers, and a little ingenuity! A clue...observe the arrows on the removable links! Enjoy!
It is the bracelet only, you have to buy the ipod apart.
Yes
The Green will not be covered.

Silver around the stone, with silver flower with stem and leaf on the front-silver loop for the chain to go through!
Hi paula, not idea this pendant. is a gift to my best friend, but she's liked this gift... regards
It's 2" long.
Approximately 1.5 inches
Yes, It does.
I would recommend a size above what you normally wear. Especially if you are wearing one or more layers underneath.
They do, green jacket black pants
I would go with the large.
Yes
They are Not noisy at all! They are made of more like a "cloth like" material rather than a "tarp like" material. I really enjoyed the tuffness and the fit!
It is watertight, but unlike nylon it is breathable. I use this product for fishing, sport events, and cold weather (snow blowing in snow storms). In each situation it repels water and wind keeping me dry and warm, yet allows air to flow. I used to wear bulky coveralls for snow blowing, no more, a pair of togg pants over my jeans and jacket over long john shirt and hoodie and im goood to go. Cold wind cut thru coveralls, put a pant or jacket over them and youll feel the difference. Lightweight too!
For an official answer, I would see their website. After owning mine for a while, I've hand washed with a very gentle detergent with no brighteners or additives. They dry pretty darn quick because they don't really get "wet". Like a tarp with water on it really.
I returned the set I bought, but I remember that the pants did not have pockets. I can't remember if the jacket did, but it probably did.
I'm 6' 180 lbs and I got the large they are a little big on me but comfortable.
Yes, It does.

probably, I wear it in the early mornings on the boat then I change to a summer weight buff for sun protection, but its sensational in the cool weather.
I don't know about the snow but I use my for driving across country on my motorcycle they did great have no complaints
The warm skin is warmer than ordinary fleece. I have this and a thick traditional fleece balaclava and the warm skin is my go to in serious weather because it blocks wind better and is tight to your head. This product is a layer of fleece and a layer of tough shiny warm wind protection. I would hand wash . I've had 2 and I think my first one would have stayed thicker longer ( 2-3 years) if I had hand washed it.
One size fits most people
Yes you can. however, if it has the skull imprint on it I wouldn't place it in the dryer. Line dry it and you should be set.
Oh yes it would work but the size may be a little too big for their head and face.
Depends on what kind of glasses you are wearing, but as a general rule yes, they do fog easily (especially in cold weather). Just get a cheap bottle of Anti-Fog and wipe your glasses with it. That should solve your problem just fine.
It I a little thicker, a little tight under a helmet, but I do it
That means it is very warm and good for winter. I really like this Item. It confortable and warm like for a motor. You should buy it!

Yes there are two. And each has two zippered pockets.
The pack is 11 1/2" across the top, tapering to a 9" bottom. It's 5 1/2" high with a 29" elastic adjustable belt. The pack is backed with a soft cotton (or like material) so that it doesn't stick to the skin. Nothing bulky will fit in the pack; it's strictly for flat objects such as passports, cash, credit cards and some coin.
Yes, it even fits under jeans - if they are not too tight. The money belt is very comfortable. So comfortable that I had to check to remind myself I still had it on.
Yes an iPhone (or even two) would fit into the larger (second) pocket.
no need to fold bills
I live in Fl, so in the dead of summer, it is cooler than anything else I have used. However, anytime you cover bother your nose and mouth, your face is going to be warm. I don't know where you live, but I really can't say too much about the cold weather. If you live up north where it does actually get cold, then my advice would be to get this one for the summer and something a little heavier for the winter. If you live in the south though, this should be fine. It works well for me year round.
The word "tactical" refers in the description is used because the hood is usually worn by people in uniform. In order to keep warm from the cold or from getting burn from the sun. Since it is available so easily, most normal people use the hood for a morning jog or to look like a ninja. Don't run into a burning house with this hood, is basically what the warning label is trying to say. Your face will burn!!! Hope I helped.
I belive it's a polyester it feels like sports clothing (compression shirts Ect) very comfortable
Unfortunately yes. Maybe is me, but The only way I can wear them without fogging up either with glasses or goggles is if I don't cover my nose
No the bottom part goes over your noes when up but your eyes are never covered
I use it for road cycling and find this to be the best one yet, it maintains good tension over the face but is easy to pull under the chin if I need a little more freedom to breathe or overheat. This garment is pretty well shaped for the face, but not rigid or "structured" in any way. The thinness of the Lycra cuts the wind without overheating the face. I hope this helps, and, I have four, it's that good a fit for the huge melon on top of my neck!
No, it is tight, but it's light weight. I find it to be pretty comfortable. At least for those times when you have to hide your face.
Its definitely one size fits all. The only Thing that might actually determine whether you need a specific size would be if you had an afro or something, or just have alot of hair in general. This item fits all heads haha.
The bag is quite large, and I think would be too big and bulky for a carry on, especially packed full.
Definitely! That and so much more!
I don't think so because of the side pocket the interior of the main section of the back is shorter.
Yes
Soft sided. Can be folded down easily
yes
If you get the 25 and you are over 5"3 to 5"5 then it will hit the back in the lower part. Hope this helps. I think you will not swim in it. Hope you enjoy your pick.
The straps are not mesh, they are padded and somewhat water resistant but I would not call them waterproof. They do not stink in summer that I have noticed.
Has a 15" computer sleeve inside but you can put the computer in the bigger part no problem. the cooler pocket is the front smaller zip pocket will fit like two bottles of water.
No, there is no velcro. It is a deep pocket almost the entire length of the inside pocket, though, and it fits snug inside.
No but it has one pouch that is insulated
Definitely. It fits my calc book study guide and solution manual with room for a chemistry book(~5lbs) notebooks and laptop. There isn't a securing strap for the laptop sleeve though, so you may want to use a sleeve for your laptop.
No
It's unisex.
They come in 2 sizes. Go with the smaller one. It will be fine.
Yep! I wear a size 9 and they fit perfect. I do recommend wearing them as a necklace though. It comes with a chain to do so .
Just one
Yes it is definetly a Metal. While I'm sure it may not be Gold or Silver, I know that it is atleast a metal, and thankfully no irritation on the fingers.
the ring might be big on you, because personally i couldn't wear any on the set i bout because they were too big.
Nope, not at all. Unless they changed the design from when I bought mine. I would contact Amazon or the seller. Possibly Amazon first.
Yeah, it's the exact same colors
Mine didn't really come in a box. They came with the velvet platform and a box cover, but not a bottom box.
Go to their website: http://www.skins.net/usa/womens-compression/a200-range/a200-women-s-compression-long-tights
It is opaque when you on it. It's silky texture but not a kind of see through. Hope it helps.
Female large. If you go to the skins website it gives u a size chart.
Medium or Large. They run pretty tight. If you would like them tight and you are losing weight, then the medium should be right for you. They are tight all over.
The pair I received is very thin and lightweight and not hot.
They are thin and flexible enough to be a base layer, but this model is not warm. I think Skins makes a thermal model, but I don't know how thin they are.
plenty long in the legs and sits on lower waist.
I'd suggest baby shampoo or dish soap and water.
No. It is attached at the edge and the zipper is in the middle.
Nope too small - you might be able to get the straightener in there but not both. Go for a bigger size if you want toiletries and hair wands!
No problem...lot more room for other things
It lasted only about a month. Very thin and not much to it.

The wig comes layered but it comes semi flatter than the picture, but all you need is to spike it yourself as desired. :3
It fits comfortably on my head. I'm a 5'11" male. The wig has an elastic waistband so if you head is a little bigger it'll still fit.
I could really only make it do the style thats shown. I bought it for 2D from gorillaz and I could not get it to lay right. Maybe hair gel/spray would make it cooperate otherwise its not really lapis's hairstyle, which is more of a bob cut with bangs. Its a good color tho, it'd work if you're okay with the style.
I would not recommend it as it feels synthetic
ive never styled it; its a bit long though i think if you cut it it should do fine! (its very thick btw i dont know if that effects your decision)
yes it is adjustable and fit up to 42
Unfortunately we do not offer this item in a larger size, however, you can join 2 of them together & cut any excess.
Hey janet....if i remember correctly i think it was green raffia. Not is cheap plastic. I was pretty satisfied with the product.
The closed dimensions are listed under Product Description, and they are accurate. The open dimensions are: Top lid open, total height = 43 in., Both sides opened total width = 23 in., front drawers extend 6 in. from front of cabinet. Just the cabinet of drawers (everything closed, and not counting the legs) = 13w x 9d x 19h. The leg assembly is 15 in high. Hope that helps.
I think it is too big to be put on a dresser. It would look awkward.
Yes, it does come with the stand which will have to be put on after received. This is a very pretty piece of furniture.
It's about 18" wide and 3' tall. holds a lot, my Granddaughter loves it.
Brass color but very lovely
No, just lined
No, it came assembled.
Open one is the one received and what we ordered. I can only see one picture so I can't comment on the rest.
Yes i would, had it for almost 2 years comfortable, lightweight and no defects so far. It os also perfect for keeping my stuff dey when the odd shower comes on, would not recommend to use the raincoat in heavy rain hough.
Well not one that is made for a tab but it has a lot of compartments so you can make one for a tab
It should work okay, but, in all honesty I'm not sure because mine was lost months ago.
mine are really nice! I ordered a size 10 shoe and got a size ten shoe. Your son will like them a lot.
Shoe size is 10 of 10.5
These particular shoes don't matter. You can move the soles back and forth between the shoes. For other types of shoes, "Righty" means that the Left shoe should slide. And for a "Lefty", the right shoe should slide.
Had mine for a year now, bowling in two leagues during the Winter season and occasionally over the summer. I have had 0 problems.
According to rep I emailed at the company: "No, the UA EVO ColdGear Compression Leggings Bottoms do not have UPF protection." They include that sort of info as a bullet point under "The Fundementals" on the product page (apparently).
I am 6'3" at 230. XL was a little short, but otherwise fit in the legs (which are slim) and hip area. Waist band slides down when exercising and needs a tie. They are warm, medium thickness and very soft.
You won't be hot and sweaty if you barely break a sweat now. Wearing these will make you warmer though inside.
They are pretty snug so, if you want a little breathing room I'd go large.
Yes...these are great! Fit well too
If you mean, will it keep you warm when the temperature is below freezing, the answer is yes. Wear them under your regular clothing and use appropriate cold weather gear when outdoors.
My father is 6'1'' and 250+. He didn't have any problems with inseam fit. But because of your height the pants may be short and possibly too big around the waist.
My husband is 6'4", 200 lbs, with a 34 inch waist. I purchased an XL for him and they fit perfectly, I would recommend an XL for you as well.
Not sure on the length size as these were for a gift. Size was Large.
My boyfriend and I have both tried them to below zero (Fahrenheit) temperatures. They work great under snowpants and take the edge off under jeans.

The following charms are included with the bracelet pack: peanut, shellfish, wheat, dairy, fish, soy, tree nut, egg, and a medical cross symbol. If you need additional charms such as sesame, strawberry, corn, coconut, chocolate, bee sting, or gluten free, these are all sold separately. You can find them by searching for "Allerbling charms" on Amazon.
There is a small (toddler) size band and a child size band in the package
You will need to call the company directly - Asia Connex, Inc.
No
Good luck getting the charms on the bracelet. It doesn't come with directions
This bracelet is great and you can find additional charms and bracelet sizes on their website allerbling.com.
I am not sure what the length is but I brought this same exact bracelet for my small 2 year old girl. I hope this is somewhat helpful. They also have different sizes on their website allerbling.com.
small medium large xxtra large
I am normally a size 1 and I bought a size small. It is a little big on me. I'm able to make it smaller because it's adjustable. I believe a small is 4-6. I'm also 5'4" and it goes just above my ankles. I think it runs true to size. If you're normally a small, I think you'll be fine with the small raincoat.
I would get the larger size because I wanted to use it over a lined raincoat (which is not waterproof!) or winter jacket. In the summer I use it alone. It has a belt that can be drawn in to make it fit more snugly.
Yes, there is. It's a zippered pouch that you store it in. It's also the same material as the raincoat.
Yes, polyester. It is not lined--I don't think you can have a lined raincoat that folds into a small bag for travel.
Water does not seem to enter into the coat.
Only has buttons.
What size does XL correspond with?
mid-calf. I am fairly tall.
Yes. I have worn it in the rain with good results.

I only got the standard backed bra I don't like racer backs
The straps have velcro. They can come completely undone in the front, but are still connected in back. I haven't had any problems with them coming undone when I didn't want them to.
There are 3 hooks in back.
I think it might be large enough to fit a ten year old boy inside. It's a pretty big bag. It really depends on how much stuff he carries and what he is going to do with it. I have looked at the small bag as well and, unless he is carrying a lot of equipment, the small bag would probably suit him better.
This is a good size bag, approx. 22 inches long by 12 wide and 12 inches deep.
Yes, long strap also included in the purchase. I use long trap every day
There is a board that comes with the bag.
Vietnam
The bag works well as an airplane carry-on. It will fit in the overhead bin.
Yes, definitely will.
Pretty strong. I'm using it for sports equipment
My sons bag seems to have a bit of rigidity. The fabric is thick and good quality.
No, depending on the size of the bottle there is a side pocket that could hold it but nothing specific for a water bottle.

Dark Gray is the color.....very nice shorts with a belt, great for hot weather.
No button - just velcro
They come in 10" and 12" inseems. I prefer the 10" it comes down to the knee. The 12 looked too long on me.
No elastic waste band, but it has adjustable belt that I really like.
No they do not. All though I like these, I wish that they were fuller through the thighs and set. Do like them just would like just a little fuller fit.
No, they do not. The front pockets are mesh lined and somewhat shallow. However, the rear pockets are velcro along with the pocket on the right thigh. The left thigh pocket is zippered. Great pair of shorts none-the-less.
Yes
Yes they do, they are made of a parachute type fabric.
Yes, but the fabric is lightweight and probably would not conceal a heavy object too well
the ones i got are cargo. pockets on the side

Yes about even with each hip, there is about 6" of very slightly elastic...it only gives a small amount of "flex" They come with an adjustable belt. The shorts run true to size and are my best summer shorts, I've got 4 pair and they're great.
Home Run for you. They have a zippered fly with button at waist, easy zipper. There is no mesh liner in the front or back of the shorts, only behind the pockets.
I believe you have inseam options of 10" or 12". I got the 12's and they hit about the middle of my kneecap. Hope this helps.
Not sure I know what you mean by that...but there is a pocket on either side and in the rear and a zipper pocket on the left leg...my husband loves them...so comfortable...
Yes - Part. On each side there is a ~6 inch section of elastic. Just enough to flex a bit.
yes. I wear them to work with a regular leather belt

Most of the reviews said they ran a size large, so I ordered one size smaller than usual and it fit good!
I believe it said 50 on the tag when I got my shirt. It says 50 in the product description. You can also Google the Columbia website to double check.
Don't know, but look like it in the photos. If you are in a hot climate and you have light duty, you will love this shirt. Feels like wearing nothing at all. Very thin material so might not hold up well if you handle a jackhammer all day.
They run slightly small or true to size. They do NOT run large. I buy these shirts for our landscape employees and traditionally will size up for the guys if I think it's a close call. For myself, a woman, I run true to size. This shirt has no stretch and has a tailored fit that looks the best if it's not too baggy, but I would size up if you're on the line.
This is a mans shirt
No. As far as wrinkles go, this shirt would not be a good choice in my experience.
The 3x is a standard 3x shirt. The 3x/tall and 3xt are the same same shirt. If you look at the sizing, you will notice that the 3X/tall or 3xt is dimmed. The 3xt is for some that is taller than normal and has the problem that the shirt does not cover their waist and the sleeves are normally short.
The shirt is made of 100% nylon it does have the sun protection in the fabric
I would say Yes. I wear a Medium and I am 180lbs, and 5'8".
It was about 34-35 inches

The shirt is made of 100% nylon it does have the sun protection in the fabric
I would say Yes. I wear a Medium and I am 180lbs, and 5'8".
It was about 34-35 inches
Most of the reviews said they ran a size large, so I ordered one size smaller than usual and it fit good!
I believe it said 50 on the tag when I got my shirt. It says 50 in the product description. You can also Google the Columbia website to double check.
Don't know, but look like it in the photos. If you are in a hot climate and you have light duty, you will love this shirt. Feels like wearing nothing at all. Very thin material so might not hold up well if you handle a jackhammer all day.
They run slightly small or true to size. They do NOT run large. I buy these shirts for our landscape employees and traditionally will size up for the guys if I think it's a close call. For myself, a woman, I run true to size. This shirt has no stretch and has a tailored fit that looks the best if it's not too baggy, but I would size up if you're on the line.

Dark Gray is the color.....very nice shorts with a belt, great for hot weather.
No button - just velcro
They come in 10" and 12" inseems. I prefer the 10" it comes down to the knee. The 12 looked too long on me.
No elastic waste band, but it has adjustable belt that I really like.
No they do not. All though I like these, I wish that they were fuller through the thighs and set. Do like them just would like just a little fuller fit.
No, they do not. The front pockets are mesh lined and somewhat shallow. However, the rear pockets are velcro along with the pocket on the right thigh. The left thigh pocket is zippered. Great pair of shorts none-the-less.
Yes
Yes they do, they are made of a parachute type fabric.
Yes, but the fabric is lightweight and probably would not conceal a heavy object too well
the ones i got are cargo. pockets on the side

Yes about even with each hip, there is about 6" of very slightly elastic...it only gives a small amount of "flex" They come with an adjustable belt. The shorts run true to size and are my best summer shorts, I've got 4 pair and they're great.
Home Run for you. They have a zippered fly with button at waist, easy zipper. There is no mesh liner in the front or back of the shorts, only behind the pockets.
I believe you have inseam options of 10" or 12". I got the 12's and they hit about the middle of my kneecap. Hope this helps.
Not sure I know what you mean by that...but there is a pocket on either side and in the rear and a zipper pocket on the left leg...my husband loves them...so comfortable...
Yes - Part. On each side there is a ~6 inch section of elastic. Just enough to flex a bit.
yes. I wear them to work with a regular leather belt
10" or 12" inseam. I buy the 12's and they hit right at top of knee cap

Mine is a small. 6.5
Yes!!!
I haven't wore it in hard rain, so I don't know how it will hold up. I have wore it in an occasional shower and it held up fine, though it is not waterproof...it did dry out quickly.
The brim is 3" wide. From side to side is 12" and from front to back is 14" when the is collapsed. The hat has an adjustable cord around the head as well as under the chin. It is a beautiful (Columbia) olive green and is extremely comfortable keeping the rays out.
The label in the hat says "Vietnam".
Bob, in my adventures to Peru with this hat, I have not had the brim sag or droop. It is a great hat and I would purchase again. Hope this helps!
People have joked with me about my "large head". The hat fits me just fine.
Yes, it for sure floats
unsure. ordered blue. tight fabric would seem to be dirt repellent but wouldn't be sure about moist dirt or mud.
The hat comes as a one size fits all. I wear a large helmet and it fits fine. If a person has an xxl or larger the hat might be a bit tight. It has an adjustable bungee type strap for a tighter fit.
Front to back the hat is 15 inches and side to side it's 12.5. (I smooshed the crown down to measure). The crown is about 3.5 inches deep. When I put on my husbands hat and pull it down it nearly covers my eyes! So, for me it's too much hat since you can't adjust how low it will go on your head. It's perfect for him and he looks great with it on.

Inseam length is slightly longer than other makes I have tried. For me that was a good thing.
think rhino or elephant
They are not waterproof but the dry very quickly and are very light. I bought four pairs for a recent Europe trip and they worked great. If necessary, you can hand wash them and they will dry in a hour or so in your hotel room.
i think is nylon
Deep forest green
There is no difference as far as make. The Extended, I think, are for those longer legged folks.. I rodered mine in 32 long as a true 32 is to short and the 34's are way to long.. So basically it's a 33 inch inseam.

Great jacket, but made in China! Packs great and doubles as a small pillow on airplane. And yes it packs small small into itself
I might recommend the medium. I'm 5'8 and 135 lbs. I think the fit is fine but it's still a little tight in the armpits. Not necessarily the chest but in the armpits themselves. Especially when I layer with a sweatshirt or something. The sleeves from the inside of the armpit measured. 22".
Yes
I'm 5'9 1/2 and about 164lbs and a Medium fits well on me. Maybe this will provide you with some guidance.
It does not have a trim fit
it weighs about 13 oz. it's a great great jacket/coat/sweater thingy. i love it. it can be squished down to very little space for packing on trips! i got it in orange and i love it!
Yes it is.
It might have some effect when it's breezy but over all it's a fairly cozy jacket. Forty and windy, I would recommend a shell over it, you would be good to twenty then.
search for it, I didn't keep it because it was for a fatter person and too short sleeves

I might recommend the medium. I'm 5'8 and 135 lbs. I think the fit is fine but it's still a little tight in the armpits. Not necessarily the chest but in the armpits themselves. Especially when I layer with a sweatshirt or something. The sleeves from the inside of the armpit measured. 22".
Yes
I'm 5'9 1/2 and about 164lbs and a Medium fits well on me. Maybe this will provide you with some guidance.
It does not have a trim fit
it weighs about 13 oz. it's a great great jacket/coat/sweater thingy. i love it. it can be squished down to very little space for packing on trips! i got it in orange and i love it!
Yes it is.
It might have some effect when it's breezy but over all it's a fairly cozy jacket. Forty and windy, I would recommend a shell over it, you would be good to twenty then.
search for it, I didn't keep it because it was for a fatter person and too short sleeves

Large
Yes it has a hood. "The insulated adjustable hood will retain body heat and keep your head protected from the elements and should the weather not call for a hood simply un-snap it and leave it at home."
Yes it does.

I bought it for my wife who is 5'4" and the coat comes down to her knee.
It is a women's size 14. I hope this helps you.
Denise...actually our daughter wore her Columbia jacket to the ski slope only a couple of days after getting it...and it performed fantastic for her...I specifically asked her if it kept her warm AND dry and she said " Yes Daddy , and I love it! " And since she no doubt spent some time on the ground , being pretty much a beginner , I'd say her Columbia more than exceeded expectations...this especially pleased me since she had originally thought she wanted a NF jacket and I assured her that Columbia had been in the business and doing it well for a very long time...she has been thrilled with her Columbia !
TA, This coat is not quite as puffy as a typical down jacket, but it appears similar and it definitely has the thickness typical of a cold weather winter jacket. It is very flexible and comfortable to wear but it is not a spring / fall weight garment.
Yes, you can machine wash it. You have to take the fur off and wash it separately. It can be dried in the dryer.
Id try the medium. It runs slightly small, but not much.
I would try a small, because it has a close fit.
Yes. Also, the fur trim can be removed.
I ordered a medium and it fits a little snug with thick shirts/sweaters on. You may want to go with a large.
I've never seen a single feather come out of this jacket. This is an amazing, high quality jacket.
I would go with medium...the purple is on darker side but very sharp looking...
If u fully zip it to the tippy top it is like a turtle neck. If you zip it to your chin it will lay flat like the picture

I ordered this jacket from Amazon and it was an authentic Columbia jacket. I will tell you also that it is one of the best jackets that I own.
It is very tight on top meaning the breast area and shoulders. I am a 38 D and I barely fit in the xl size. Other then that it is a great coat go 1 size or 2 up.
I think it would be great because of how light it is. It's also a great windbreaker. I don't think you'd get too hot.
Yes, machine wash on cold and tumble dry on low.it washes beautifully.
Yes
This jacket doesn't have a hood, but it's nice and warm and light. Made small - you must order one size bigger.
I usually wear a LG to an XL in most clothes. In this jacket I chose to get an XL. Since I typically layer quite a bit under my jacket, it is the perfect size. It isn't bulky at all, so I would probably recommend the Medium if you plan on layering underneath. Otherwise I'd go with the Small.The jacket is very packable. I think that you will love it. I hope that this helps.
I think this jacket maybe a little too thin for skiing and I am not sure if it's windproof. Personally, I wouldn't wear it for skiing. Overall, that's great jacket just to go to school or shopping. I hope this helps.
I think it will keep you warm not sure about fit for physical activity though. The heat reflective technology is very effective.
It closes normally.
No they haven't. I've had mine for a year or almost a year & they still look new. My daughter wears hers more often than I wear mine & hers are still in really good condition. They haven't fuzzed or stretched out. Hope that helps.
I'm 5'8" and 125 and the small fits me very well. They do have an athletic looking seam down both sides so I probably wouldn't wear them under a skirt. I run in them.
I wear a 10 or 12 and am comfortable in a large. They are meant to fit VERY snugly. An XL or 1XL (if you sometimes need an 18) should be a good fit.
Probably still small to medium. They do not have much stretch or give so if you are afraid the small will still be too small the medium may work and if not then you could just send them back and exchange them. They do run some what small.
My daughter wears them for soccer and she says they do not slide down.
Yes. In my opinion when I wear the compressions, I feel more secure. I feel my legs are supported as I run. I do not feel overly compressed or too tight. I wear them for every run and love the feel. Definitely recommend.
I don't notice the compression on the lower back. They ride pretty low.

There is no battery. It would take some electronic components to accomplish a setup like that. These are designed to plug into a vehicle harness.
It appears that these gloves are designed to work with that adaptor that connects directly to the battery only.how ever you can I believe purchase another adaptor that would allow you to plug them into your adaptor on the bike.
They operate on your bike's battery and your engine recharges the battery while you drive, just like your car. There are two wires for the battery which hook directly up to the positive and negative terminals. Then you run the wires up to your handlebars, and I coiled the extra wire and secured it with a cable tie. Then you just plug in your gloves when you're ready to ride. Super easy - don't doubt yourself. It will be simple to put in.
Hello, You will have to get an adapter.
That depends on the wiring that comes with your battery tender. I'm not sure what the end of the battery tender looks like. The Venture harness attaches to the battery with two eyelets. The battery terminals have a hole in them that you run a bolt through to hold the bike's cables in place. For the Venture harness, you just attach it the same way. Then there is a second harness which plugs into the end of the battery harness, and splits to go to each glove. It looks kind of like an RCA audio jack on both ends. Sorry I can't be much more help, but trust me, the Venture harness is easy to install.
Sorry they were a gift and not the correct item. I assume they were returned
I sent mine back as they were a gift and my wife didn't know they were 12 volt direct hookup. I was after battery operated rechargeable gloves, sorry.
I don't know ,are not want I wanted,
The gloves I have connect to my motorcycle battery and yours should connect to the battery on your vehicle
No... Don't ride a bike, but these gloves don't look thin enough to go under anything. They are so great, you don't need a liner. Wore them in the Arctic (-15 C) and fingers were oh so warm
I'm a 36C and ordered the large. It fits close and keeps me from bouncing, but isn't uncomfortable in any way. I ordered the gray and then ordered 2 more because they're my favorite gym bras. I don't know if the medium would be too tight or if it would just offer more support. I don't like to be squeezed so I'm staying with the large. They wash really well too. I don't put them in the dryer but they dry really fast hanging up.
No, there's no padding in this bra. I wear it under a t-shirt at the gym and the look is smooth with very little bounce. It's very comfortable and provides good support.
not sure, but it may help you to know my sizing. I am 34 D and I wear the medium. It's nice and snug around my torso, but it does squish my gals a bit more than I'd like. However, a larger size does not give me enough support and feels like it would stretch out around the torso, over time and laundering. It depends on how much compression and support you want. I would guess a medium would also work for you, but perhaps other 36C's could answer...
In all honesty, I used to be a 36DD and this type of sports bra was never good for me. Now that I've lost weight and am a lot smaller in size these fit very nicely. I say this because the straps are very narrow and when you are larger chested these tend to dig into your shoulders. Your wife might feel too much movement in a top like this. I would suggest perhaps an Adidas or Nike type that has wider straps. Depends on the specific kind but I used to be able to fit into a large or xlarge, depending on brands.
I'd go with a SM
I'm 34C and the small for well (full coverage and compression) so probably the large? Except with 36 I might go up because I always find the sides tightish?
No
Yes wireless! I haven't seen my nipples poke through it, it has a pretty good layer but I have small nipples.... Hmmm.
Yup, pretty quick drying. The sizes run small though so order appropriately :-)

I have not sold anything to Jennifer.
the only solution I came up with was to install two small stainless steel rings on the small center zipper pulls, and lock them together..it's not ideal but can think of no other way...the rings are like key rings, 1/4 inch and slotted...I got them online...I also wrote High Sierra and requested they improve their bag by going back to the larger/sturdier zippers it had just last year..it really is baffling to get a check through bag you can't lock properly

no, it does not.
China
I would go with XL
I usually wear large jackets and this one was quite snug on me. I would suggest a size up on your usual size if you plan on wearing a thick layer underneath it.
I'm 6'0, 185 and like my clothing fitted. I find the large to be bulky. I can fit a base layer, shirt, and down jacket underneath with a little too much room.
Yes. I'm 5'11 3/4 and 188 lbs. and generally wear a men's M for a snug but night right fit. This fits me perfectly.
I'm 5'9' at 152 lbs and like the relaxed fit especially over a light weight fleece. However it sounds like you may prefer a medium.
I'm not sure how much it weighs in oz's but it is the LIGHTEST jacket I've ever owned; throw it in your bag and you forget it is there. Super light
no, it does not.

I usually wear large jackets and this one was quite snug on me. I would suggest a size up on your usual size if you plan on wearing a thick layer underneath it.
I'm 6'0, 185 and like my clothing fitted. I find the large to be bulky. I can fit a base layer, shirt, and down jacket underneath with a little too much room.
Yes. I'm 5'11 3/4 and 188 lbs. and generally wear a men's M for a snug but night right fit. This fits me perfectly.
I'm 5'9' at 152 lbs and like the relaxed fit especially over a light weight fleece. However it sounds like you may prefer a medium.
I'm not sure how much it weighs in oz's but it is the LIGHTEST jacket I've ever owned; throw it in your bag and you forget it is there. Super light
no, it does not.

Outdoor Research Hat Sizing Chart SIZE SMALL MEDIUM LARGE XL U.S. 6 7/8 7 1/8 7 3/8 7 5/8
Outdoor Research states that a Small Hat=21 5/8" a Medium Hat=22 1/2" and a Large Hat=23 1/4". Measurement would be taken around the head where the hat would fit comfortably. If I measured 22" I would go up to a Medium since these hats are 98% cotton and will probably shrink slightly from washing.
The label says "machine wash cold / drip dry" But I play it safe and just wash it by hand in the shower.
It's the same color as the rest of the Hat
About 50%
Yes you can. The chin strap just keeps the hat on your head the other one makes it a little more snug. I wear a 7 3/4 size hat and the XL size fits me but If it's windy I don't worry about losing the hat with both of those straps.
2 5/8"
Yes the brim is semi rigid. Not as rigid as a ball cap but you can form the brim. Hope this helps
The XL is sized to fit up to a 7 5/8 hat size. I normally wear a 7.5 and this XL hat fit me fine. It also has a built in sizing cord at the rear of the head band to make any minor adjustments to the fit.
2.5 inches
It would probably be OK. The brim is quite small, so even if it was absolutely sodden it shouldn't flap over your face. It would dry very quickly. I've washed mine with no shrinkage.
I would guess a little bigger than that - maybe 3 or 3.5 - but I don't have it here to measure. Sorry!
No it isn't a large brim and I haven't had this problem in wind. It does flip up often, but then comes back down. The strap does well at keeping the hat on. The hat is very light nylon and I've never had it feel hot. I live in very hot weather and wear it in the sun often.
Get a flat tape measure (like your granny used in sewing) and measure your head right above the ears. A lot of hats sold have a size chart. And if you have thick curly hair take accountability for that in your measuring. Most one size fits all is for small heads....hint.
Visit the Outdoor Research website--they have complete sizing info there.
A medium fits my head perfectly and I measured right above the line of my glasses and it was about 22 inches..Very pleased with the hat !
If you look next to the drop down box where you select your hat size, you'll see a link to "sizing info". This will tell you what size of hat to order based on the measurement of your head.

I wore this on the Camino de Santiago. It went through rain and hail. BUT you should know that I wore it with the rain poncho over all, and mainly the front brim's job was to keep the water (and the hail) off of my glasses and face. It did well at that job. If I had worn it without the poncho, though, the wind would have flipped the brim all over the place and much of my face and neck would have been wet. HTH!
I wear this hate about five times a week for kayaking, outrigger canoeing, and hiking in Hawaii. I have never put it in the machine but I hand wash it all the time. It still looks good and has not shrunk, with hand washing. Betsy
I would size up. I have a small /medium head but I do not like tight hats plus it has a neck cord so wont blow off. I got an XL.
The front and side brim is 3-1/8 Inch wide, and the back brim is 4-1/2 Inch wide. The brim provides good protection from sun, and the crown has a flattering shape for women.
I took a soft measuring tape and measured around my head at the forehead. Then I went on line and googled women's hat sizes to see if I was a medium etc. You can be a bit off as this style hat has a draw to tighten it up a bit.
I bought this hat and have it in a very light tan with dark greenish brown trim around the brim. It definitely is not RED or Purple. I can't recall if the color was called Trillium. Why doesn't Amazon give this question to its supplier for clarity?

There is not a bag but the jacket folds up compactly.
The jacket that l bought is a men Large. The bottom of the jacket is 46.5" or 118 cm. Sorry, I don 't know the measurement for xxl. Check Marmot website.
Solid and waterproof all around, so if you have wet hands and place them in your pockets, the moisture will remain in the pocket and not reach your shirt.
I'd think the Large would be plenty enough for either a fleece and/or single down layer.
Yes it is...tried this jacket in heavy snow in Europe last year and heavy rain in Costa Rica...no issues at all...
Yes xl would fit just right because the fit is slightly tailored and large would be too tight.
Yes, there are zippered/Velcro pockets on both sides near the waist that extend to the front zipper area.
Yes, there are bungees that allow you to tighten up the seal too. I'm telling you, it is the the best light weight, waterproof biking jacket I've ever invested in.
Yes. I have this jacket for a while and love it. Great for heavy rain. Comfortable. Definitely meeting my expectations.

The large fits a big smug.
Here in switzerland, i wear it in automn and spring, but not on rainy days.
In winter is better but also in autumm or early spring. For me is the best jacket i ever have!
what size jacket should I but I'm a 36dd bust ?

Sure, this is a wonderful product. I have pins displayed and it works great.
Yes as the foam is like a denser memory foam.. I used it for my sons high school track medals and had to use stick pins this worked great, especially if you have to move them around a few or more times...great quality...
19x14x2.25
If you have some way of pinning the medals to the foam backing, then I guess you could. But the box seems to be built more for lapel pins than medals/medallions. I think that a coin display box would work better for race medals.
No it is fixed to the back of the case.
I suppose if you wanted to post pierced earrings to it it would work fine. Many of the lapel pins I have in mine are no bigger than many earrings I have seen woman wearing.
No, it doesn't. That being said, it holds the pins quite well without needing the backs. But I keep all my backs in a separate container for when I'm wearing them.
Yes, if you can figure out some way to attach the items to the fabric inside the box. I used glue to attach some items directly to the fabric. Other items (polished stones) I attached by gluing two thumbtacks on the back of each stone and then pressing the ends of the thumbtacks into the fabric. A bit tedious but worked.
Dimensions: 19"H X 14"W
I do not know. We did not try any. All of our pins have the "stick" to push thru. However I do not think Velcro would work properly. The fabric is fairly thin.
Hi - I'm almost the same proportions as you are, 5'7 & 130 - I'd get the small! They're pretty long and pretty roomy.
Yes they do.
i'm 5'4 and i bought a extra small and it's a tiny bit too long. i don't think you'll have to worry about them being too tight either because they are still baggy on me and i'm usually a 5/6 as well. i usually would buy a medium or maybe even a small sometimes. I think a medium might be a tad too big. But i don't want to give you bad advice either.
I would say they have medium warmth. They are a lighter weight sweat pant but do provide some warmth. Would recommend!
Yes
the inseam is 31" from the stitching to the bottom of leg
Xsmall for sure
Actually, yes, I gave mine to my husband who is 6ft...they were too big and long for me at 5ft 5..
They would not be too short. Medium would definitely not be baggy. Can not tell you if you need a large. They run a little big.
Yes it has a drawstring

I would say they have medium warmth. They are a lighter weight sweat pant but do provide some warmth. Would recommend!
Yes
the inseam is 31" from the stitching to the bottom of leg
Xsmall for sure
Actually, yes, I gave mine to my husband who is 6ft...they were too big and long for me at 5ft 5..
They would not be too short. Medium would definitely not be baggy. Can not tell you if you need a large. They run a little big.
Yes it has a drawstring
Hi - I'm almost the same proportions as you are, 5'7 & 130 - I'd get the small! They're pretty long and pretty roomy.
Yes they do.

I have 11 cards in the big compartment along with some bills folded in. Plus I have one in the outside pocket and one on the inside flap. I could get more in if I wanted too.
yes i have and it does work , but they can still read them when you take your credit card out to use it, in a store.
The one I received was black.
No, I ahve not.
No. It turns on its own when you spin it.
About two inches between each tier.
Yes, it does spin, though not really fast or anything.
You mean that little bottom part? 1.5"
The base is about 5 1/2 inches round
Not sure if this helps, but My hubby is a standard size Medium in blend T shirts, I get larges in 100% cotton since they shrink. All of his Under Armour Cotton Charged is a medium and they fit perfect and the length is standard. Not super long and not short. He has 3 long sleeved and 6 short sleeved and none have shrunk.
They're loose, not tapered through the mid section. They look good on you if you have an athletic build.
True to sized. My husband wears a medium in all ua shirts. He has a bunch of cotton charged, a few of the other and polos too & all are med. In other brand shirts, he is a med or large( if cut small). . His med cotton charged fit well.
Sun protection factor -- like sunscreen.
It's around 42 inches i believe but this thing is really soft and stretchy so if you're any bigger it would mold to you. This isn't one of those compressed so its not tight, really loosed fit.
We have never had any of our under armour shrink, even if put in dryer.

These pants are NOT water proof, however they have a wicking feature which enables them to dry quickly.
Mine were XL and those are the 38-40 range.
XL
Yes.
I have a 38" waist and ordered large, which are fine for me. I think for a 36" you might want medium. They have an elastic waistband so they are pretty adaptable. Tom
Hey Jeff, I am about a 30 waist in most jeans and the mediums fit me nicely. I can just get away with not needing a belt. What sold me on these was the leg room at the knees. They aren't baggy, but do really like room to move around in and not feel constricted. Hope this helps!
There is for mine. But then, my phone's on the small side, and my wallet's pretty thin...so your mileage may vary. The pockets aren't cargo pockets but they are pretty generous.
I bought the 30" inseam pants and the shorts are 10"
Sorry, I am no good at that matter. Mine were XL and quite spacious. I was pleased.
Hi Ben, I'm a 37 1/2" waist and the large are fine on me. Snug enough to stay up without a belt, but because of the elastic there's lots of room. You might even want to think about a medium but definitely not XL. Tom
for me, it is excellent.
Not a good product will not buy again
I do not speak a foreign language.
I bought this for my 12 yr old grandson for his "treasures". It was very nice and does have a lock. This box should last him even as he grows into an adult.
Based on my past observation of ashes, I would say no, not quite large enough.
It is 9 3/16 inches (length) x 6 3/16 inches (width) and 2 5/8 inches deep. The lid of the box is 1 5/16 inches deep. The key is made of brass. The length of the key (bow & blade together) is 1 1/4 inches long. It resembles an old fashioned skeleton key. The key hole is in the middle of the front of the box . The carving around it matches the carving on the rest of the box.

Yes! I love them. I sell south hill lockets and I put charms in them. You can also set them side by side an they magnet together. I love them!
The box is 8.5 inches x 14.75 inches and comes with a magnetic cover that does not increase the size. The gem jars are exactly 1 inch inner diameter. They have a small lid that is slightly larger than 1 inch.
It does come with the gem jars. Each jar also has a foam insert inside.
Mandy, You can use these with nipple piercings but I would be very careful. Do not put them over the piercing but on the tip of the nipples. I hope that helps. Thank you, Customer Care My Pleasure Box

Yes, I think there were about 4 different types...
Yes
I used them in center pieces for a mardi gras theme.
They worked for beautifully!
Yes they do. We used them for a party and they worked really well.
Yes they do, there is a band. How elastic it is, I can't remember but there is a band.
Includes dryer. All u see in the pic.
Yes! However, you have to stagger the height of the boots such that one pair is on the risers and the other pair mounted without the risers. There is approximately 2" between the risers (forward to rear direction) so mounting two pair of most any boots at the same height is rather tight. I use the dryer mostly for wadding boots but have dried my ski boots with it as well. Works good! For soaked wadding boots it generally takes two cycles of the timer to fully dry the boots.
230 Watt / 120 volt
pull the knob off, try a drop of super glue on the end of the exposed shaft, replace the knob, let dry (about 5 min)...
Contact the manufacture. .. www.maxxdry.com
My model is 230 watts
No
it's quitter than my hair dryer... very nice unit.
I've never tried to dry waders with mine, but I can tell you that although much shorter, I have no problem drying 2 pairs of bulky Motocross boots simultaneously. So I would think that it should be possible.
This product expands up to 18 cm, 6 cm each section. I am a Jehovah's Witness and I put a lot of books. as 30 magazines of 16 pages, 2 bibles of 6 inches, and 5 books more.
It's black leather, honestly don't know dimension, but my Wife also utilizes it for business travel with her 17" laptop.
Yes!
not feminie at all i would say
Has three separate compartment, file type. Can put files in one, center one has zipper, can utilize for laptop or lunch :-)
Pretty sure the flap is velcro and there is a zipper on the other side - it has lots of compartments
Yes it will.
30-inches
The smaller middle pocket holds my hard eyeglass case if thats what u need to hear. Credit card holder is in the back of the big pocket so it doesnt interfere w/anything hope this helps
I am uncertain of the total extended waist size Am assuming around 42.
yes, inside the middle compartment.:) i just love mine and i have had no problems with the zippers as some have reported. but then, i do not over stuff it.....
To answer your question the main compartment is 11 inches long and over 4 inches deep you can put something 5 inches wide in the compartment. The 11 inches is doable probably by putting one corner of the the wallet in first.
uniform leather
I have a 40 inch waste and it appeared to have about 6 more inches of adjustment and that is on the outside of my belt so I would say it would fit a 46 inch waste easy.
I measured 28 + 7 or 35 inches total not counting buckles.
I have a 42 inch waist and there is more than enough room in the waist band. If you have an Apple I phone I would not recommend this pouch because the phone does not fit and the leather has already ripped at the seam.
It's about a 44 - 46 max
You could wear a 16. Or if you want more coverage. Go 4. an 18.
I have a long torso and it fits me fine. I am 5' 8".
The straps are metal and I have not had any issues with them. No slipping or cutting into my shoulders. It is a nice suit top and I ordered it in a size 12. Hope this is helpful.
I am a 34D and fit comfortably in a size 8 top.
I think it would flatter any figure and definitely lifts.
I go up a size so it you can wear a large then that be what I'd get I'm a 42d n I bought a large it fits perfectly
It's decent. But I wished I had a size smaller. I'm a 38/36c. I wore this in Hawaii all day And I felt supported. It think if I had the right size, it would have been better.
Sorry but I did not keep the suit and don't remember the back.
No. But it does a good job of holding everything in place
My bra size is 40D and I bought a size 18. It has great support and very comfortable. I can't say what size tankini you should get. But i believe it should support your size.

The straps are metal and I have not had any issues with them. No slipping or cutting into my shoulders. It is a nice suit top and I ordered it in a size 12. Hope this is helpful.
I am a 34D and fit comfortably in a size 8 top.
I think it would flatter any figure and definitely lifts.
I go up a size so it you can wear a large then that be what I'd get I'm a 42d n I bought a large it fits perfectly
It's decent. But I wished I had a size smaller. I'm a 38/36c. I wore this in Hawaii all day And I felt supported. It think if I had the right size, it would have been better.
Sorry but I did not keep the suit and don't remember the back.
No. But it does a good job of holding everything in place
My bra size is 40D and I bought a size 18. It has great support and very comfortable. I can't say what size tankini you should get. But i believe it should support your size.

Yes. The bag is much bigger than it appears. You should have no problem fitting a 15" laptop in it.
This bag fits easily under airplane seats, including regional jets. I carry a MacBook Air, iPad, power adapters and a notebook within.
I don't think it is waterproof, but it is rather water resistant. It is made from like a woven, waxy, material. I have had mine in the rain for several hours, as my job requires using electronics in an outside environment, and none of my gadgets nor papers on the inside of the bag were affected.
Yes....you just need the appropriate voltage adapter for the country you are traveling to.
There are micro and mini usb chargers on it also. You can also pigtail a usb cord straight off the battery.
There is a usb port on the side of the battery. If you can charge via usb then yes. Otherwise there are only mini, micro, and apple device connectors.
Yes as long as the binder and textbook are not overly bulky.
No problem with airport security. I travel a lot and was surprised that it goes right through.
4 ft 3 inches
No, no padding, you can use them for other purposes as well....
I'm sure you can spray rain repellent on and it might work. But the Capris itself is already somewhat waterproof. It drys really quick.
I don't think is quite appropriate not elastic enough why don't you try this website for cool yoga pants Hotchakrasyoga.com
Nope! No padding.
Hi! We did. I ordered size L for my husband and we exchanged it for M. He does love the shorts! Good luck!
Yes/No. Yes: They keep me covered temperature wise on my ride to work, but I'm in sunny socal, so the whole climate is wind resistant. It's a thin outdoor/breathable material. No: These are shorts, with a breathable material. Would I use these to bike on a cold Chicago day, maybe, I'm a sweater, so it'd keep me balanced; but once you stop riding/moving around, the punishment would ensue. Hope this helps.

One pair
like all socks you can sweat in them, but the way they are made it will keep the water off better than most. can't tell you much more sorry.
Truly I do not know. If I had to hazard a guess, I would say no. I'm very happy with them and they are thick and warm. They do not itch me at all. If you are allergic to wool, you may want o call the manufacture. I don't remember if there is anything in the description. Sorry I could not be more helpful.
absolutely washable...i do them in woolite-cold water and line dry. I wear them...(size 9 shoe) and they are great...a little bulky but keeping my feet warm are totally worth it!!! Good luck!
It will be very difficult if your shoes are a perfect fit. If they are about 1 size bigger, then you might be able to wear them. I bought them to wear with my ski boots, which are about 1 size bigger and hoped that this would not interfere with the fit of the boot! I could not get my foot in the boot at all!! I ended up wearing them as toasty bed-room socks around the house with my PJ and sweats.
Just one
warmest socks I ever had, and very soft and comfy, no rubs. I love them
No wool. Awesomely warm socks. I wear them all winter here in Chicago.
I would think you would ask a doctor that question. If your foot is warm but your toes remain cold that sounds more like a circulation problem not a warmth problem. All I know is that my feet stayed toasty, and consequently I didn't get chilled when wearing the socks. Great stuff.
It will definitely work. Since the Rohnan boot is full grain smooth leather, sno seal will work perfectly. Just note that sno seal will definitely darken the boots' color, unless it is black to begin with. One downside of sno seal is that after application, the surface of the leather becomes slightly tacky/sticky, which attracts dust and dirt. Other than that, sno seal really does waterproof boots and shoes. Just make sure you work sno seal into any seams and stitch work. And make sure to heat the boots and/or the sno seal to melt the wax into the leather.
I use a hair dryer on my boots at the end and it leaves the boots clean and soft. Not sticky.
use a hairdryer to melt the sno seal in. do not over heat
If you scrub the boots the best you can and apply as directed it should cover them up. It also covers most scuffs as well. I do a lot of plowing and salting in the winter and have the same problem and it works on my wolverines. Also is amazing at keeping your feet dry. Hope this helps
No but I think it would be fine. It's for leather
Probably not much you can do. Your leather has a finish that does not allow the penetration of the Sno Seal. Your best option is to get some Kiwi Wax shoe polish and keep them waxed and polished. If you are using the boots for rough, outdoor activities, the Sno Seal will penetrate in a year or two of wearing off the original sealed finish. Look closely, your boots may not be real leather. Consult the manufacturer of the boot for care and use.
No
Yes Slightly Lighter Color Leathers Tend To Darken More Than Darker colors
It does not. I use Italian leather 100% boots made by Asolo. www.asolo.com
No they are not, they are made out of very thin paper, not great. Ok, If you can't find the original filters, Good luck on your quest :)
Fits model RCM-832 ReliOn cool mist humidifier
Hi Patsy the dimensions are approximately 4 x 6 x 1 1/2 and has 2 filters per box. I hope it helps!
Yes, but they are a little small and get out of position occasionally.
No
What is the question?
I think a lot has to do how one is built and how the pants are made. In my case I normally wear a women's 24 in jeans. I have tried on jeans that are too tight and say 24. I have a bigger rear end, smaller waist, and my legs are smaller compared to the rest of me (that changes without notice!). They fit me pretty good in the legs but they wouldn't snap due to the top part being smaller on me. They are not hemed and I wish they had been, I hate hemming pants but one does what one must. I hope this helps and good luck to you.
They fit natural waist. They are very comfortable.
I don't remember the exact length, but they come unhemmed and VERY long. I am a 6' tall woman and had plenty of extra material when I hemmed the cuffs...and I can never find pants long enough for me, so this was awesome!
yes they may but you may need to have them altered in length if you have short legs.
Yes. The pants are true to size. I would recommend when washing them, that you hang them to dry.
It's dark grey
It's 65 percent polyester and 35 percent cotton. Very light weight pants-great for hot weather but does not have the soft comfort feel of jeans. I had to get my hemmed-it comes that way and I can't sew. I wore the 5.11 brand of cargo pants more-they come hemmed and you can buy with more cotton content.
This is just from my own experience: I wear a 16w and I bought an 18w and they are snug. Keep in mind that they do not stretch at all.

I think a lot has to do how one is built and how the pants are made. In my case I normally wear a women's 24 in jeans. I have tried on jeans that are too tight and say 24. I have a bigger rear end, smaller waist, and my legs are smaller compared to the rest of me (that changes without notice!). They fit me pretty good in the legs but they wouldn't snap due to the top part being smaller on me. They are not hemed and I wish they had been, I hate hemming pants but one does what one must. I hope this helps and good luck to you.
They fit natural waist. They are very comfortable.
I don't remember the exact length, but they come unhemmed and VERY long. I am a 6' tall woman and had plenty of extra material when I hemmed the cuffs...and I can never find pants long enough for me, so this was awesome!
yes they may but you may need to have them altered in length if you have short legs.
Yes. The pants are true to size. I would recommend when washing them, that you hang them to dry.
It's dark grey
It's 65 percent polyester and 35 percent cotton. Very light weight pants-great for hot weather but does not have the soft comfort feel of jeans.

I am sorry for the delay. I gave these as a gift and I had problems in receiving information from the person who had the laces. You can replace the battery. It is a CR2032 Lithium cell 3 volt - looks like a watch battery.
4days ago i never used :( but i was really mad and i trow it away so thankyou
I think they'd be fine in the rain. All the "lace" is is a opaque tube. The light comes from the battery pack.
If you just order 1, it is shipped via USPS First Class mail and should arrive 2-3 days after it is shipped depending on where you are located.
You can certainly buy all the colors that you desire from our company, (other vendors may have limited availability,) however, Amazon may have different prices on the different colors/listings.
There is only 1 size
I have a 6" glass orb hanging on mine. I bought this piece to specifically display this item. However, I do not have pets or children and it sits away from traffic. It is not prone to tipping unless someone physically hits it. I love it.
It would definitely be big and sturdy enough.
I gave this to my daughter for Christmas but I do not believe that the words "gun metal" were anywhere on the package. In fact, I believe that the item was only wrapped in plastic in an Amazon carton with no interior packaging. I would have called this more of a bronze finish...but my memory may be faulty.
I don't know. It's fabric so I suppose you could but it would probably take a while to dry out.
Shipping is from China, our of warehouse, takes 21-30 days
Says 'sports'
I ordered these for my 6-yr old son, so I unfortunately can not tell you if they work or not, sorry.
There is no customization available on these ranges.
one is an earring container (in my opinion) many small cubes to put things in - about 30? . Another has two lengthwise strips (like the back of the top) and then multiple ring holders running the length. the bottom one is deep with 3 sections, running front to back) for large cuff bracelets, big pins, etc).
We are planning to be back in stock later this year, certainly in time for the pre-xmas period.
Sorry I don't know. The maker is in Great Britain, try searching the internet.
The sections are not connected, but the have a little edge that nests the levels together. You can remove each level.
You are right. There is nothing holding them together. They are just stacked upon each other nicely. They worked out perfect for us, no more lost jewelry!
Hi Linda, the inside is all felt lined. The exterior is probably faux-leather. They do not attach/snap together, but rather nest inside each other. The bottom of each "drawer" is cut in slightly so that it sits inside the drawer below. I.e.: If you wantd to move the entire unit, you would pick it up from the bottom section. I hope this helps.
All Classic Stackers are separate and interchangeable, and designed to stack on top of one another, this is the essence of the Brand. The Deep 3 Section Stacker is about 2.4 inches in height and will fit neatly and securely into your Set of 4.
This set includes 4 separate pieces that stack together. One piece has a lid and 7 sections, so you would always use that on as the top level in the stack. You can put the other 3 in which ever order you prefer.
The "Deep 3" tray will accommodate jewelry no more than 2" deep.
Nothing is stated in description about the lining being anti-tarnish but after using a polishing cloth to remove tarnish on my sterling silver jewelry, I add a few silica gel packs in my Stackers jewelry box and they stay tarnish free!
Unfortunately no you cannot lock it but it's pretty great.
I love the light grey lining because it is easy to see silver or gold jewelry; as well as onyx colored stones. If the lining in a jewelry box is to dark it is very hard to see some of your jewelry. With this one it is easy to see it all. I love mine!
As long as the additional piece doesn't have a lid, you can add it anywhere in the stack. They are all independent boxes and can be organized in almost any order (the one with the lid always being on top). I purchased that set along with 2 additional boxes (in white) and I change the order all the time. The each have a little lip at the bottom to help them stack snugly together.
No, I put anti- tarnish strips in the different layers. You can also purchase clear plastic silver tarnish resistant bags. This does not have treated fabric or specific cloth so no special abilities.
Its metal.
Did not extend wide enough in my 10.5D to do the job!
Yes yo can by turning the l-shaped metal rod clockwise. Works great!
I'm not sure but the width is adjustable as well as the length.
they make women shoe streachers, men are a little bigger
Go for a different brand..This one is no good...One of the two pieces broke the second time I used it...Not good stuff.
do not buy cheap crap
shipping is free unless going to Alaska or Hawaii or out of Country....
they suck, do not buy
They can solve both but depends on the type and grade quality of the leather involved.
I think that since this is a more straighter design, and high heels/stiletto heel type shoe are so curved, it might have a difficult time trying to push the front end of this into the front of a shoe like that. There is absolutely no flexibility in the metal part of this device. However, I have seen shoe trees for high heels, so if you search a little bit further, you'll find them. Good luck!
I am not an expert on this, but my guess is that size Large in mens which says from I believe it said 9 to 14.
A woman's 7 is the size of a men's 5.5-6, so it won't fit very well. You prob need different size stretchers.
yes, but not past the instep. I lengthened right foot and widened both
What your looking for is a Bravo-fit Premium Men's Shoe Stretchers - Large Size 10-14
I would suggest using a women's stretcher in a size 8 because it's easier to extend the stretchers but difficult to make one that is too big fit the shoe. Get the ones that can do width and length adjustments cuz it will make things easier. Good luck.
I wear the same size. I ordered the 8-10 size. Worked great
I used it on a Size 9 Shoe that clearly was more of an 8.5 - the SMALL MEN'S size will work fine - there was A LOT left on the threads when I used mine.
I've got a 32-34" waist, weigh about 165 lbs, and mediums are just loose enough to wear another layer of long johns underneath.
I'm 5'6", 200 lbs. Waist is 36" and inseam 29". The medium fits me well. A little long in the legd, but everything else is a good fit. Awesome product. Last I wore them under a pair of jeans in minus 35 degree wind chill for a 5 hour outdoor project and I never felt a chill.
No
Small or extra small for both. You want them snug! I ordered a 2x for my hubby bc his thighs are large! They fit him perfectly.
Soft, fleecy inside. Soft but smooth fabric outside. No plastic/nylon feel at all.
I wear a waist size 30, and ordered size small. They fit very well. The style is intended to be a snug fit, but they are loose enough and stretchy enough to allow plenty of movement.
I wear 42" waist pants and the 2x fits me well.
OK, I'm 6'0", 155 lbs, 31" waist and 32" inseam. I got the small and they fit great, so probably the medium for your son.
Sorry, I bought a Small and they're ~30"-31", great pants, BTW!!
My husband has a 34" waist and I got him a Large!!

Not really round to measure, it a LARGE hood, as if it was removed from a coat. LARGE n droopy!
If going to a costume party - a little (depending on what you wore with it). In general, Yes it would look odd. (at least I think so)
Washer yes but on a light load and let air dry
About 40 inches..
This set includes the apron and her buttons. I'd considered just buying the apron and then making the buttons/nametag myself, but I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the ones included in this bundle. No wig, no shirt, no pants or headband, this is just the apron and her "I (heart) insurance" button and "Flo" nametag. Really worth it, and the apron is excellent quality as well. You may be able to find another vendor who sells just the apron, but personally I would recommend getting the tags that are included with this.
No it's not. It was too long for me so I just cut it and tied it.
I think it would be fine if she isn't too short... My 13 year old is 90 lbs and probably 5'1 and it fits her.
Hi Judy. I am a size 10ish and it fit just fine. I think it would probably be ok for anyone from sizes 8-14.
No it doesn't come with a head band.
Name tag and button are pin ons. Progressive logo is screen printed on the apron.
The buttons were real buttons. It's a great costume. I'm going to be Flo again this year for Halloween!
Not it does not
No.
No they are separate and are actual pins be careful if you have a small child I wore the Apron last night And my flo name tag fell off I have to glue it back on for Halloween but other than that wonderful product
They stay tight after being washed several times and fenced in.
I know what you mean - my FOTLs shrink up pretty quickly. Not these. They keep their shape really well. Good quality material.
The ones we bought were pure white!
Yes, the pack is for six shirts. Two reasons I like the shirts: 1) they are heavier than the standard fruit of the loom shirts (which may NOT be a good thing if you are in a warm climate, but great if you want a thicker more durable shirt). 2) they are two inches longer than standard shirts and are less likely to ride up out of your pants.
Kirkland T-shirts are some of the heaviest T-shirts on the market. They are not "see through" Kirkland T-shirts are the only ones I wear, would recommend them to all
They seem to, but best of all they do not shrink
yes, same size.
For the size that someone typically wears, these shirts are little tighter on the chest and neck. Not too tight though. I've bought these about a year ago, so not sure what new means
They are superior to Hanes in every way. Minimal to no shrinkage, thicker cotton, very comfortable. I ordered another soon after receiving the first package.
Hust barely. But great stuff.

Yes
I'm a 10.5 or 11 depending on the manufacturer, and I'm a 45. Hope this helps!
The shoe came with the nut plates to mount your cleats but does not come with the SPD cleats themselves so you will have to buy them separately.
I bought a size 47 and normally wear a size 11 shoe (11.5 sneakers) with D width. Don't see how somebody with an EEEE width could wear these. In consideration that you will be spending a lot of time in your shoes, my suggestion is that you go to a local bicycling shop and get properly fitted. You'll be happy that you did.
Either Shimano SH51 or SH56 will work with this shoe.
Yes, SM-SH55 cleats work with these shoes
Yes, they should. You need to check how the speedplay cleats attachment
Not sure the size to fit your foot, but my size 10.5 foot fits the Euro size 45 shoe perfectly.
Yes they are compatible. I used them with M985's with no problems.
44
Not secured but I've never had a problem with the tongue slipping, very comfortable. Mine are still like new, low usage.
No
Is wide, I also have a wide foot. Just in case I buy a number more than use.
No.
Don't know. They were to Nero. Went with MC 50's mtb shoe nice and light. Wide toe box good for older foot. See spec.
size 9 shoe
Yes, all shimano, crank brothers and other major pedals will work.

I believe the M in SH-WM51 stands for Women. This shoe does not come with the SPD clip, depending on what you are needing it for. If you are using it for indoor cycling/spin I would recommend the single release SPD clip if you are an outside cyclist I think you may want to go with the dual release. I recommend you getting the clip and having it installed at a local bike shop for the best fit. I love my Shimano's! I mainly use them for indoor cycling. Hope this helps.
I believe that a 6 1/2 womans US shoe converts to a a 37 1/2 in the european size. Hope this helps!
I bought the very regular SHIMANO SPD CLEAT SET (SM-SH52), fitts perfectly.
you should be 39 EUR. I am 8 US bough 39 EUR and fits perfectly.
I usually wear an 8 or 8.5 in regular shoes and typically buy size 39 UK. However, most cycling shoes run small...l wear 40 so you would probably get 39 in these
EU 41, 25.8 cm.
Yes!
They are true to size and are width adjustable. I would order an 8 if you are typically an 8. If you're in between I would order a half size up because your feet swell when you work out.

I wear an 8.5 and the 41 is perfect.
Nope. These are SPD only shoes.
41.5 the EURO size. You can find this on the tong of one of her tennis shoes.
unfortunately no, you have to buy the cleats separate. I bought these: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R2MYB4/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
I wear size 8 so I bought the 41. It is just the right size. So based on your info I would go with the 42. Better to have a little large than too small.
Yes, but not sure what clickr is. I bought the plate that installs on the bittom of the should so I click onto the pedal at the YMCA spinning bike.
Sorry don't know as I purchased for US size. I would recommend checking Shimano's website for women's sizing chart.
I am a 7 wide and I got 39. I was amazed having wide was not an issue at all. I got my sizing right the first shot. Good luck. You'll live them
I would like to ask you to go to local bike shop and try them on in person. That is how I figured out my size.
Size 8 is usually a 40.

They are true to size and are width adjustable. I would order an 8 if you are typically an 8. If you're in between I would order a half size up because your feet swell when you work out.
I believe the M in SH-WM51 stands for Women. This shoe does not come with the SPD clip, depending on what you are needing it for. If you are using it for indoor cycling/spin I would recommend the single release SPD clip if you are an outside cyclist I think you may want to go with the dual release. I recommend you getting the clip and having it installed at a local bike shop for the best fit. I love my Shimano's! I mainly use them for indoor cycling. Hope this helps.
I believe that a 6 1/2 womans US shoe converts to a a 37 1/2 in the european size. Hope this helps!
I bought the very regular SHIMANO SPD CLEAT SET (SM-SH52), fitts perfectly.
you should be 39 EUR. I am 8 US bough 39 EUR and fits perfectly.
I usually wear an 8 or 8.5 in regular shoes and typically buy size 39 UK. However, most cycling shoes run small...l wear 40 so you would probably get 39 in these

I'm between a 10-10.5 and I originally ordered 43 and they were small. I ended up getting 45 and fits perfect. I might go .5-1 bigger in this shoe than you normally would.
Nathan, I got the size right on the second try. I wear a US 10/10.5 and on the inside of shoe it says EU 45, US 10.5. I would error on the larger side. If you're pushing 11 I'd go a size larger 46/47. Hope this helps. Great shoe!
Cleats are extra. I believe it came with the bolts.

I wear an 8.5 and the 41 is perfect.
Nope. These are SPD only shoes.
41.5 the EURO size. You can find this on the tong of one of her tennis shoes.
unfortunately no, you have to buy the cleats separate. I bought these: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R2MYB4/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
I wear size 8 so I bought the 41. It is just the right size. So based on your info I would go with the 42. Better to have a little large than too small.
Yes, but not sure what clickr is. I bought the plate that installs on the bittom of the should so I click onto the pedal at the YMCA spinning bike.
Sorry don't know as I purchased for US size. I would recommend checking Shimano's website for women's sizing chart.
I am a 7 wide and I got 39. I was amazed having wide was not an issue at all. I got my sizing right the first shot. Good luck. You'll live them
I would like to ask you to go to local bike shop and try them on in person. That is how I figured out my size.

Depends on how you wear your tactical clothes. I am 6' and have a 48-50" chest and wear an XL. I wear soft armor and plates over it so I want the shirt a little tighter to avoid any material bunching. I have a 2 XL for just going to the range. They are true to size and don't really shrink. They are more fitted in the chest area, but not restrictive.
The arms are a bit thicker, but chest and back are then. I wear a vest on top of it to carry gear, so in that aspect it does great. If you go just the shirt, you will feel the hits.
now I bought a 4x and the sleeves are a little long but I like that. If you have a belly like me get a size bigger
What ever you wear in Shirt and jacket is the same size here just go bigger if your not sure on how its going to fit
The best I can tell from the sizing chart, L, L2 &L3 refer to Large Short, Large Regular & Large Long. I don't remember mine being listed this way. Mine says L/R on the tag.
I'm about the same and wear a large. I normally wear large to fit my shoulders and length of arms. Most typical large shirts fit loose around the waist but this one is snug. The torso stretches to fit, so that helps when family gatherings and holiday meals make the material seem to shrink.
The sizing on mine is fine. It fits like most of my other large shirts do.

The diameter is 3/8 and the fit in all my dress shirts just fine.
I haven't flown with them, but they shouldn't be any worse than cuff links.
Absolutely. I've done 2; works fine.
The spring goes around the collar button...then button part into collar button hole. Collar is less tight around your neck. In my job I wear a long sleeve shirt, and tie year round. I find the collar extension makes it more comfortable!
More like springs. They can pinch some too
Have not intentionally tried. I accidently sent them to the laundry once or twice and on both occasions they can back still attached.
Come Whith .wax neutral.
It came with some. But I use a paste polish and be sure to wet the cloth if you don't it will leave a ton of lint in the shoe.
Not sure of exact size, but it is identical to the one pictured with this question. One in the same! Probably about16" long and about 8" tall.
It doesn't appear to be compatible as it states 120 volt 60 Hz 120 watt. I will try to upload the label.
It comes with a liquid polish for all types of shoes. See the white nozzle on the right side? That's the dispenser. I'd use this once I was out or check with the manufacturer and order refills. http://www.ghbass.com/shop/mens/footwear/shoe-care/tube-shoe-polish_6790_105.html?gclid=CJvKjO6Y7rwCFcURMwodgzYAKQ
You have to plug it in. It is not rechargeable.
I choose not to, because it was so difficult. i put polish on by hand and just use the buffer by itself.
Meilifang, (The company that makes the wig), is based in china. But I am not sure where the company who is selling it is based. The wig is pretty good quality for the price, I am considering buying another wig from this company for a future cosplay project.
Yes it can be straightened with a straightener. I straightened mine when the curls became too frizzy.
I would describe it as a bubblegum pink. Not dark. Not neon.
Hi, No - I have lots of big watches, and they will not fit here. I use this for large pendants and they fit from a width perspective but are sometimes tight from a depth perspective. There is some good clearance on the top when you close the case, as the glass panel doesn't fit snugly against the base of the case, but your watch would not "curl" up and fit into a single slot. You could probably put the watch face within one of the slots, and then drape the band over and let it "spill" into the adjacent slots. But watches would only fit face up, not on their sides. It's not deep enough. I will try some of my big watches tonight, just to be sure, and reply again tomorrow. UPDATE - tried it last night and didn't like how the watches worked. I'd say NO.
2 inches high, 14 wide and 9.5 inches long
The slots appear to be an insert. The box itself is solidly built. The insert is not removable and it is covered with a velvet like material. I have really enjoyed it.
No. The slots are all. Good for earrings, rings or cuff links.
I'm not sure hun my wedding band has already changed colors sorry
I'm not exactly sure, but very small, probably 4 or 5. I wear a 7 or 8 and this wasn't even close! (It's beautiful, but unless you can wear it, it's certainly not worth $90!!) Good luck.
Womens size 7. Very pretty but they turned after a few months
It was a size 8. Hope this helps!
The one i got was just metal. Like a bubble gum machine ring. Not sterling silver.
i do believe so because i ran into the same problem i wear a 6 1/2 myself i hope this helps but it might cost a little extra but it is well worth it.
I think the size shls be listed. i obnviously want the size or not interested.
The box does not list the material of the rings. I believe that it is stainless steel, but can not say for sure.
Case itself is 10 3/8 by 7 3/8 and 4 inches tall. There are two trays inside that have 24 compartments each. Each tray is about 1 1/2 inches tall. Great storage for pandora/chamilia type beads
Yes, the bangle bracelet can be put in the little pouch on the top. Earrings shouldn't fall out if you put them in the top section & pad the box between earrings & top. Make sure shut tightly!
Yes, ALL of the individual dividers/sections can be removed - both top and bottom.
Yes it will
It is not real leather. But it is very nice.
1. It has 48 sections, 24 in the top tray and 24 on the bottom. 2. It is not leather but I guess some type of nice vinyl. It has a very nice feel to it.
Case itself is 10 3/8 by 7 3/8 and 4 inches tall. There are two trays inside that have 24 compartments each. Each tray is about 1 1/2 inche
There are no holes or slots provided for that purpose. It is solid in the back and bottom.
The lower drawer opens and closes if that's what you're asking. the upper compartment's lid is on a hinge and opens and shuts.
one of is 1 1/2 X 3", other 1 1/2 X 6"
Depends on how flat your watch lays. It fits a Swiss Army Champ, which is thicker than any watch I've seen, but if the band causes the watch to bulge up it could be an issue. Sorry that I can't give you specific measurments, but knowing that a knife of standardized size fits might be helpful.
About 11"X 5"
Not that I'm aware of.
It feels like pressed wood but sounds, when you tap it or close the lid, like real wood. If you ask for it to be engraved like I did, make sure they do it because mine wasn't.
When I ordered it it said navy blue. When I received it , it was royal blue. I reported the error just in case they had sent the wrong one and just received another one royal blue and red.
It is royal blue
I was a bit disappointed because I thought it was navy based on pic, but it was royal blue.
I dont know about them being in stock but they MUST be kept clean and handled with care. The strap loops are thin for stealth reasons and can break if not handled delicately. I would get extra adhesive especially if you are going to wear them for long periods and quite often. If it is just for Halloween the adhesive that is on it is just fine.
the straps on the breastform are a clear plastic type deal so wearing it with a strapless dress is okay it will just look like there is a clear bra strap on
No, not a lining. They put a piece of plastic on the back as a protective measure-to help make them last longer. That piece of plastic you peal off then what goes against your skin is the same material as what you see from the front (It is the same substance all threw the form.) but the back is VERY adhesive.
Yes it does. The only down side is if you take the sheets out of the pack, the earrings easily fall off. I gave sheets away to some of her friends and they went all over the place.
Yes, The Goody Bag can ship to Sweden. The shipping should automatically calculate when you add items to the shopping cart.
They worked for my daughter... Maybe your hands were oily.
No, an iPad mini measuring 7.8" x 5.3" is too tall to fit completely into the pocket. It hangs out far enough that I'm afraid it would fall out. As a point of information, my iPhone 5 nestles in there with room to spare.
It is a light weight vest - more suitable for the early Fall weather.
I bought a large and I'm a 12. Not sure that helps but it fits great
The vest runs true to size, but the fit is trim and close, especially when layering. The tailoring is well shaped.
I believe it's cotton. I don't have it with me. Love the vest and it washes beautifully. I would buy another color.
Two pockets on the sides. The pockets zip and also have a snap on a tab for added security and a nice design detail. It's a shapely, good quality, snazzy looking vest. It's cut to hang a bit lower in the back for extra coverage when you're seated.
If the 110 cm is your chest circumference that is about 44 inches. I wear the size large vest and measure around 40 inches, so you would probably need the extra large
The tag indicates it is made of 60% polyester 20% nylon and 20% metallic lurex. It also indicates that they were made in Taiwan R.O.C. FYI: I have sensitive skin but these have not caused any reactions for me yet. Also, they are meant to be worn underneath other gloves or socks to create the warmth so they are thin. I have only used the socks and they work really well, without making my feet to hot, and I haven't had a hole yet.
They did not work for me under my gloves. Not to mention they turned my fingers green and also were so thin they did not provide ANY warmth.
Perhaps not -all- (if for a woman with -huge- hands), but I have large-ish hands for a woman, women's glove size "large", and they fit fine - but snugly. My hands are almost 7.5 inches from base of palm/wrist to tip of middle finger; my fingers aren't fat...but I asked my husband, with much larger hands, to see if he could get these on, and he could - the fabric stretches quite a bit! (They -are- billed as -women's- gloves.)
I suppose they help to the extent that any extra layer adds warmth. But I would not say they add anything special. I would go for silk glove liners as the best option for hands (get them from an equestrian store/online seller).
They are extremely thin, so I think they would be perfect for tighter fitting shoes.
I wear a 6 1/2 and the socks fit pretty snug so they may work for a size 5. You want to wear them under a pair of socks. The gloves are to be worn under another pair of gloves as well. Both the socks and gloves work well to keep your feet and hands warm. My husband works outdoors and wears these when the weather is cold and it keeps him alot warmer.
the women I gave this to say nothing about that happing even after they got wet .
I don't have pictures but this bag has more pockets than you have stuff! The main pocket expands to 6" wide, I carry a lunch cooler (6 pack size) and it fits in the main compartment along with a thermos but it is big enough for a laptop. Under the big flap, there is a smaller zipper compartment that I carry a Kindle, small umbrella, and several small items. Outside the smaller compartment there small open compartment and pockets great for pens, glasses, cell phone. On the same side there is a small zippered compartment big enough for glasses or a cell phone. On the opposite side there is a zippered compartment suitable for file folder and it has another zipper on the bottom so that you could thread the telescoping handle of luggage thru so that it won't fall off. I carry this to work everyday and I really like it.
I don't think so. It is made of a very nice durable canvas and lined with something less durable. The accents are vinyl and overall the bag is very good for what we use it for. There was nothing on the bag when we first got it that said anything about being waterproof.
Not strictly waterproof (although I haven't actually tested it), but probably water resistant, since it's lined with nylon.
Yes they do but are very comfortable.
Fits fairly tight around lower calf..not too tight, but the elastic band at the top does its job
I have them just below the calf. That's only about where they go unless you force them to go up higher.
It'll look sweet
Yeah kinda
Product is good for the price but I'm not sure it's of gifting quality. Unless for a kiddo. It had over spray in some areas so paint wasn't perfect. It seems fairly sturdy though. Takes a loooong time to ship.
7-14 days ^^
They are a lot larger than I imagine 2 feet by 3 feet being. I had bought them as diving bags for scalloping and they are way too big to dive with but work great for holding all our diving gear walking down to the beach.
We hang ours by the drawstrings.
nylon
I did not wall mount it and I have not had a problem. It's filled with pounds of jewelry and still as stable as ever.
Yes they do!
It's about 3.5 feet tall and 1.5 feet wide.
Yes, but not too many. Maybe about 8 in the bottom drawers; the top drawers aren't deep enough.
It is a regular mirror.....no cloudy spotted appearance.
It is about four feet or so. I am 5'5 and it comes to my chest. I absolutely love this piece. If you search for Powell Mirrored Dresser, you will see the matching dresser for it. There is also Powell Mirrored cabinets that are very nice. I want both pieces lol! I searched for many mirrored jewelry armoires, and this is definitely what I was looking for. Great quality and sturdy. I have had mine for almost a year, no issues at all.
Closed
The drawer interiors are all 10-7/8" wide and 9-1/2" deep.
40 inches
Yes
You can probably lock the end of the zipper to the plastic that the strap attaches to, but you'd need a longer hook than a typical, tiny luggage lock. I imagine TSA approved luggage lock would work. The mesh isn't heavy duty, so if someone wants to cut into the bag, it wouldn't be much of a problem. But a lock would deter someone from opening the bag if it was left in a non-secure area. (The bag works great for our purposes. To and from soccer practice at my son's school.)
It is mesh, not the solid bottom.
No
It holds up to 15 lbs
It is pretty strong, can probably hold anything you can lift.
It's a lightweight bag, so a pair of shoes, sweats, socks is about all you can place in there.
I really would not recommend it , can't hold a lot
The dimensions are given on the bag's page on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Sport-Mesh-Roll-Bag-Black/dp/B0065ZC9W6
It &gt;s mesh on bottom only end are solid i pack it heavy everyday for worksmsll things i use ziplock bag im ordering more soon for friends
The boot comes with 2 wool felt insoles. No wool felt liner
around a Men's size 10.
Yes
These are called "Wellco Extreme Cold Weather Muckluck". In the "product description" it says, "wool liners are also available". Contact Wellco from that page.
we have small,medium and large....
They come in Med, And Large. Large will fit size 10-12.
Don't buy it the leather is cheep and mine ripped in a week
yes, good quality. I ride and it would definetly be protection
buy the 5x, you won't be disappointed.
IT WILL DEFINITELY FIT XL. I'M NOT SURE ABOUT XXL.
Funny you should ask. My hubby is wearing his right now (can't get him out of it!). The sleeve length is 19" and the width across the back is 27". The edge of the sleeve hits his wrists.
You can actually roll the sleeves down to make them longer if you are sitting around and want to be warm but they appear to roll themselves back up when you are moving around. It makes it nice if you are cooking or doing anything where you don't want the sleeves in the way.
I would say yes.
I m 5'7" and it hits my legs at the middle of my shins.
Hi, CR2032
Picture looks like they might be, but they are not. This is my 4th "model" of WileyX I've owned, and I must say I like these the best.
No most lenses don't unless you get custom "Transition" brand. The one I ordered was a smoke gray throughout. Not the two shades as shown in picture
Yes, they are total polarized.
The one I have is a continuous gray tint
The pair I received had an all grey lens.
It has a faint sound, but it sweeps
No
yes it is?
A good size. But I had to get a refund because my handle was off when I receive it. And the piece to hold it together was in pieces
I would say no. It's a fashion watch. I work in the ER but I'm also a nursing student. So for lab or weekly clinical- it does the job. The band is stiff & thin. It's pretty. That's about all it's got going for it.
No they are not. Water resistant maybe but not water proof.
They refer to width. I believe D is normal width and E is wider.
No they have a carbon finer toe meets ansi specs for steel toes
2 inches

Yes, but it will probably only fit a 13'' laptop that's slim (MacBook Pro, Macbook Air, or any kind of Ultrabook)
Row of notches is used to attach items.
Yes it does!
TNF stands for "The North Face", so basically it's black.
Yes, to certain extent.
no it can only fit one 13inch laptop
I would classify it as medium size. Not the attack small type and not the big carry all your stuff in it. Good for short trips. Holds well up to 17 inch size notebooks and a few pieces of clothes. I use mine to go back and forth from the office. Roughly, 20 inches high and 12 inches wide. Official measurements in the specs. Excellent day commuter to the office (for me).
yes, its water resistant, i had it soaked in the rain and inside was pretty dry. I don't know about submerging the bag though...
I don't know but I ordered the brown backpack which I received, and don't recall the word "router" used. Sorry.....
Nothing is difference

It does not have a dedicated laptop compartment. However i can fit my 17inch alienware laptop in it (which is not a small computer). So most normal size laptops will fit.
What's cc lol?

My daughter bought this before her freshman year in college. She has a Macbook Pro with a case. I can tell you that the pack is somewhat on the small side which may be good. A smaller laptop won't rattle around as much.
It's one size fits all. I'm 6'6" and it's plenty long enough and fits perfectly.
is this unisex or there men's and women's sizes
large and the material is thin...
No. Mine did not. There was a lot of lint in the dryer filter, but all towels give off a great deal of lint. I didn't dry it with colors.
Cold weather.
My husband is 5'10" and it hits him mid calf, maybe just a little lower.
Short answer "no" it will not protect you in any way from a bump. The crown of the cap is strong/thin/elastic mesh that breathes to keep a sweaty head cooler. No protection afforded at all - I use mine under a logger's helmet to ease the helmet on/off - keep hair out of my face - and the sweatband to keep sweat out of my eyes. Hope this answer helps you.
Definitely. Its way bigger than the photos would lead you to believe. I bought it myself to wear with my motorcycle helmet, and its actually too big.(Helmet size 2xl, with full head of hair, and still covers my ears)
I wear mine under my helment and it does fit more snug because of the sweatband but it keeps my head so much cooler.
It should be perfect for that! I wear mine under ni lacrosse helmet and it works very nicely!
Yup!
He uses the cap with helmet, but the cap helps with the sweat and the heat. He recommend it.
it's light and pretty comfortable. I use it when I play racquetball, and I have a full head of hair.
For me it partially covers my ears. My head is a bit larger than average.
Someone should be able too, this fits pretty snug and shouldn't slip.
Yes, it's really well crafted all edges clean and everything about it was great, I got it for my mom for Christmas and she nearly cried. Not being paid to say this either and I'm not affiliated with this company, but this is a really good gift for moms
Looks to be 3x5
It is included.
It's supposed to play part of What A Wonderful World. My mom lives out of state, she loved it, and hers did play the music. But without hearing it personally, I cannot say what part it does, if I had to guess it's whatever is in the sellers description... or.... "And I think to myself what a wonderful world" all I know for the price it's a steal. No idea who the person performing the audio is Hope this was of help
Yes, they sell in pairs.
One pair
The 3 front strips (poorly manufactured; threads came loosen before used) probably provide additional compression stress. The logo is just the standard Adidas trade logo.
Ya, these things rip easy though so I got two packs.
Hi. This is Jason from Alchemy Goods. Finding the right size can be a little confusing. The size ranges we give are actual body measurements. This can differ from a pant size significantly and sizes between brands and even within brand styles (low rise, mid rise, etc) can also vary. The most accurate is to take a physical measurement. If you are basing your decision on a jean size, we recommend adding two inches to the waist size of the jeans and then finding that size in the chart.
Craftsmanship-wise, yes. But it's made of recycled bike tubes... so it looks like it's made of recycled bike tubes. I'd save it for jeans/shorts/khakis.
Sierra, No, the belt I have does not have a removable buckle.
The belt is flexible. So, if you were to hold your fingers on the edges of the belt and squeeze, it bends fairly easily.

I believe it is 54" long but could be 52 1/2". (Had one before and not sure which one is the new one!)
There are no hangers included. The frame provides a "rail" for you to hand your hangers on. The frame is made of heavy guage wire.
Like cotton canvas
The bag is a light taupe with white piping; the zipper looks well made.
This garment bag is made of canvas and is fairly sturdy. It isn't thick canvas, but the few I purchased from Bed Bath approximately three years ago are still in great shape. I recently purchased several from amazon because Bed Bath no longer stocks them and I wanted my expanding wardrobe to be protected from both dust and wool-eating critters. I hope this helps!
About four feet.
I don't know if it washable. I haven't had it that long.
I bought my older daughter a size medium (she's a size 7 shoe) and she was happy with the fit. They had a little room in the toe, but she could not have worn the size small because my other daughter who wears a size 6 shoe, got the size small and they fit her perfectly.
I wear a size 12 shoe. The men's large fits me well.
No itches here my dear...I cannot wear wool either but this is the fine yarn and it works great! I have my good witch ones on as we text. I wear them all year long unless it is extremely warm. Hope you try them. I've got five pair.
I have the medium, great fit, I wear women's 9 1/2
I bought medium I wear 8-8.5 ladies shoe

The barrel is 1", although the box says 1.5".
My straightener curls very well. The plates move slightly side to side and push down which helps prevent pulling. I absolutely love mine and would definatly recommend it
No. It will stay on until you turn it off.
No heat pouch included
It's approximately 12 inches long. I'm not sure of exact measurements, I'm sorry. The plates are 1.5 :)
Yes
I'm not sure I gave mine away since I didn't like it n it burned most of my hair off. :(
It goes up to 460. Best flat irons I have ever had. I have natural African American hair. Tameka
I didn't get one in my box, but asked the seller for one and they were nice enough to send one to me.
Yes just like one in mall
Yes, the one I got does have blue eyes, like a husky dog.
As far as I can tell, these are all one size. They appear to fit average sized adult heads, maybe a tad on the smallish side. If your child is indeed currently young and small headed, you might have to modify these to fit snugly.
Nope...My son has worn it everyday for 2 winters now
Yes. It fits my adult head, and my head isn't small!
Of course it can repel rain, it is basically an oversized umbrella, which is great to keep kitty's dry
It will but the poles are small & might wobble. I bought ours to put into a hole already in the turtle that's in one of the green turtle sand box that we have sowed grass in for our 4 indoor cats that is on top deck without shade. They love it. But I think this was made more for sticking in sand/beach for shade. Held up for 3 Summers & just bought a large one for more shade. Hope this helps.
I sent back the item because it was cheaply built. and flimsy. I don't recall if if tilted
Didn't measure it but it appears to be right at an inch or slightly less
There are two poles & each approximately 38"-40"
I believe it was advertised as 6.5 ft. When we used it, it was the same standard size we have always used. Light, and I must mention the great slide up easy way of clicking the umbrella up, unlike the horrid, they never work for me, round button type. As you can tell I loved this umbrella. We do use a screw type of apparatus in the sand to put our umbrellas in, to prevent blowing over, no matter whose brand.
Womens!
Not sheer! Besides, it has shorts underneath.
The skirt is 15 1/2" measured from top of waistband (on size 4). Hope this helps!
No it does not
Pull on...
I'm 5'4" and the skirt comes mid-thigh. I find it the perfect length; not too short - not too long. Very comfortable to golf in.

I'm very high waisted also and the large sits up on my natural waist above my belly button. Do not know the rise off hand
nope. There is a small pocket for my access card and key, and a tennis ball cannot fit in it.
Yes, they are.
l or xl.
Amanda please note that I have purchase one of these for my daughter in which her size is medium but when the item arrive the one tag was small and the other was medium... I don't think this item is size properly.
Can't say for sure - for women they work great; however, there is nothing to my knowledge that would preclude a man from wearing them. With Amazon, you can almost always return an item that doesn't work out!
Since I a just a bit bigger than 90 lbs -- I will have to guess. I do guess that they will work -- they run a bit small and they are very close fitting. Based on my experience, I doubt that they will 'bag out' on you as you run. Good luck, it's hard to run in ill-fitting clothing so I hope you find something that works.
There is no sizing chart for this item. Sizes are listed in small, medium, large etc. I bought a medium and it fitted perfectly. I am 5'5', 155lbs
No, the internal pocket will not hold your phone, it is too short, your phone may fall out
Well, if you have wide thighs they might be tight. I have wide thighs and a large still felt tight. If you're thinner with smaller hips you should be alright

You may want to. I am 5'3" on a good day and there is not much fabric at my ankles when wearing these.
I personally think they run kinda of small so maybe a small size.
I would go with a size small. I am 5'8" 130 lbs. and got a medium.
I'm 5'7", 135 pounds, and I got a size medium. So I think a medium should work
Depends if you want tights to stop just above ankles in which case they are probably too short, but product itself is great: fabric thin but good stretch, has withstood washing well, feels like a second skin!

The small ring that is chained to the main piece is a 7 or 8 since it fits my pinkie but is a tiny bit loose. The main ring it self is of similar size umfortumately. I had to use a hammer to break off the small finger guard from the main piece to be able to wear it on my middle finger. A bit loose but I have a size 10 plain silver ring that I wear with the main piece to stop it from moving. I'm a guy with piano hands so I don't know if it will turn out the same. Think its made for younger ppl.
I can move it a little, But I really don't wear it only bought because I like the anime
It can be for anyone. It's definitely a cosplay accessory however, so wearing it in an everyday environment is probably not ideal. It's pretty bulky and over the top. More for cosplay and con wear.
its a thumb ring now
22 x 14 x 9 inches. If packed really full, the 9 inches might be 10-11 inches. If concern is airlines strict guidelines for carry-on, it should fit, even on United, if not packed to the absolute max.
It would be tough to write this off as a women's bag... I've brought this on with a computer bag and walked right on while everyone else with me at the back of the line had to check in their roller bags. With this on my back flight attendants don't even look twice. But it would be tough to pass as a handbag. if you are in a situation in which you will have this and a roller style carry on, I would assume your second carry on will get checked.
No difference between 46L and 46L
The zippers are made specifically to accommodate a luggage lock!
Packing cubes are great, I use them all the time. A 17x12 garmet folder will fit nicely in the bag as will 2 of the 14x10 sizes with smaller ones tucked in around the edge. It's had to give an exact number that you can fit as it depends on how full you pack them and how tight you cram them in. Well worth trying. If you haven't tried a garmet folder, they're great.
Just one on top of the bag
It has 4 D rings on the side with the zipper opening.
no it opens from the top with a zipper. the opening is oval in shape and large enough to comfortably put everything inside
Definitely. There are two sets of clips for the compression straps, the right set can compress it down to the size of a briefcase if you need to. I fit a week's worth of vacation clothing under the seat of a Delta 737 (using the bundle method)
I believe it is, but there may be a new design on the market of which I am unaware.
22 x 14 x 9 inches. If packed really full, the 9 inches might be 10-11 inches. If concern is airlines strict guidelines for carry-on, it should fit, even on United, if not packed to the absolute max.
It would be tough to write this off as a women's bag... I've brought this on with a computer bag and walked right on while everyone else with me at the back of the line had to check in their roller bags. With this on my back flight attendants don't even look twice. But it would be tough to pass as a handbag. if you are in a situation in which you will have this and a roller style carry on, I would assume your second carry on will get checked.
No difference between 46L and 46L

No packing pocket but you get it pretty small. I'd sY good for packing
It is good to wear in light rain or snow!
The sleeves are a tad long. They have the neoprene wrist guards for use in snow and those where quite long as well. The body is sleek and form fitting with longer sleeves but they do not have any extra bulk or look out of place in anyway. It is a great light weight but warm jacket.
I have a 38 in chest measurement and a large fits beautifully.
I usually wear an XL and had to get this in a 1X in order to have room to move.
I think the mighty lite is pretty durable. I'm in my third winter with mine and it still looks brand new.
It really depends on how and where you carry your weight. I would order one size up from whatever size you would normally use to buy a zip up jacket.
Stains easily. My sling bag was rubbing the jacket against my jeans and color from jeans was transferred. There was a few brown stain which I can't remove. Awesome jacket though but white not recommended.
Oh yes, sweater or sweatshirt !
It can easily be turned down.

mine wasn't, they used to be.
Its virgin jade when it is new it is a brighter green but as the years go on it turns a dark green
It's roughly an inch in diameter. A nice size for a female necklace
Dark Gray is the color.....very nice shorts with a belt, great for hot weather.
No button - just velcro
They come in 10" and 12" inseems. I prefer the 10" it comes down to the knee. The 12 looked too long on me.
No elastic waste band, but it has adjustable belt that I really like.
No they do not. All though I like these, I wish that they were fuller through the thighs and set. Do like them just would like just a little fuller fit.
No, they do not. The front pockets are mesh lined and somewhat shallow. However, the rear pockets are velcro along with the pocket on the right thigh. The left thigh pocket is zippered. Great pair of shorts none-the-less.
Yes
Yes they do, they are made of a parachute type fabric.
Yes, but the fabric is lightweight and probably would not conceal a heavy object too well
the ones i got are cargo. pockets on the side
It's big. 50" is the length and ~30" is the width of the opening when flattened.
It does not close by zipper. It has an Metal O type opening and you fold and hook the top parts over and through the O hole and then clip. Nothing will fall out.
Yes
Yes
It's too large for carry-on baggage.
yes, this is a large well built sturdy canvas bag. Richard
The ones I received were 50" x 30"
I've only traveled with this bag in Mexican airline and have had no problems
Yes it is a misprint. When you unfold it, it is 50x30. The above dimensions your questioning must be the dimensions when you receive the FOLDED item. Hope this helps. Thank you.
The full Length is 36" and the Diameter is 21"
I don't know, Mike. I was only looking for and bought the pants. I don't remember seeing a jacket.
My husband wears a 36X36 and the waist is perfect but the length is short. My guess is that they are more like 33" inseam. I even let the hem out and they are still short hitting mid ankle.
36-38

I would order xxl then.
Well the 7 j jackect is water proof and has breathable sides and has a nice hood but it wont keep you to warm I'm not sure about a dubliner it's a pretty decent jacket
No
No it is not just sits on the jacket
No. It is just a single zipper. It is a great jacket, fits well and good looking.
It's just the jacket
white on my navy one
It's waterproof, but not warm!

8 bags
I believe there were 8
Yes. We did the same thing for my son's party bags.
theres a padded divider which is great for a laptop but may not be best for LOTS of books, but if you like a divider for say books and something else it could still work. does not balance well / sit on its own. that said, i love the oil rubbed fabric finish and the deep purple color & style... functionality as a laptop bag is great.
The handles are too short for over the shoulder use. The long shoulder strap (which is long enough for crossbody use) can be shorten enough so it feels like a handbag strap.
Yes, it has a shoulder strap.
Absolutely, that's exactly what I used it for on my last trip. It is very durable. I have a thing for bags and this is my favorite. I even ordered another one and use it for school.
Probably not as the face of the watch may not stay on top of the bar if the strap is too long. You could have about 5 to 6 watches per bar but the lowest bar may be too low to the counter for the watch to hang properly.
It's 6.5 inches deep and 9 inches high, 12 inches wide.
It's about 10 inches tall
The diameter is 2 inches.
One way from the bottom up.
Yes they do
You roll the hood into the collar and fasten it with the Velcro. I just fold it and it fits in a small space for me. The material is so thin. I recently took mine to Hawaii and wore it almost every day. It is rain resistant but not rain repellant.
yes, it has a hood. It folds into the collar when you don't use it and attached with velcro. I bought three of these jackets - for two of my daughters and myself... we all love the jacket!

Inside there is a space which has slots in it for holding rings or post-type earrings. Below this is a small mirror which is the width of the armoire and approximately 10" to 12" in height. Under mirror are metal pegs which hold necklaces. There is adequate space to accommodate hanging longer necklaces. Under this are 3 rows of small bins supported by thin metal rods. Each bin has 3 smaller bins good for holding small post earrings and cuff type bracelets that won't hand on the pegs. On the inside of the door there are many rows of spaces to hold pierced earrings. They work great for earrings with wires as opposed to posts. Below this are 2 rows of metal posts for more necklaces. They are spaced widely apart to accommodate longer necklaces. The while inside is covered with a black velvet-type fabric which is soft so it is gentle on the jewelry. The armoire is well made and hangs over the door without any problem. I find it an excellent way to store my jewelry and seeing all jewelry when the door is opened is great as opposed to opening box after box to decide what jewelry to wear that day. I highly recommend this Armoire. Hope this helps.
Yes. Leave off the "over the door hooks" and put screws through the back of the cabinet into the wall/studs. The holes are already there to do so.
The measurements given are 35.6cm wide, 121.9cm high and 10.8cm deep. I measured mine at 14 inches wide, 47 l/2 inches high and 4 inches deep. When you hang it over a door you can adjust how high or low you want to hang it to see yourself best in the mirror
It gives a better reflection than my over the door mirror but I wouldn't say it's first class.
There are two flat hooks simular to one you would use to hang a wreath on your door but much more sturdy. No nails no drilling.
No lock, it has a magnetic closure.
I think around ten pounds also. It's solid & pretty heavy, with or without jewelry, & it is holding up very well on the door.
I don't think it would stay. It's not real heavy, but it does gave some weight and will be even heavier with jewelry. If the door is open and closed a lot like where I have mine, I think it would strip out and fall even if you used plastic anchors.
No, it's not.
I hung ours on a door that is a walk in closet. It's in the closet so I notice no smell. Try fabreezing the inside or using dry cache's of your favorite potpourri.
You have lots of choices. Push button once, it stays on 1 color at a time. Push twice, it slowly flashes. Push three times - lots of colors etc. For the price, this is the best item I've bought. I've ordered them 3x. Great for parties, amusement parks, concerts etc.
It doesn't have an automatic shut off so if you turn it on it'll just go and go until the battery goes dead. I'm not sure how many hours of battery time it's good for but I've left mine on all night long on several occasions and it's still going strong!
It's only 1 of the disco ball.
Plastic. It is a good size though, probably about as big as a tennis ball. Very effective!
The best way to do this would just be to put the items into your cart and have Amazon check out give you a quote on shipping. Different sellers handle their shipping costs differently so, the answer to this will vary depending on who you decide to make your final purchase with.
This will depend on who you buy from and when. We generally have several cases on hand.

They have very high quality arms. It is not brittle plastic. It is flexible. I have a big head so being flexible really help them fit well. I use mine every week and love them!
Prescription lenses are 1.5 inches (4 cm) tall
From the Wiley X wbsite: 'Removable, soft foam Facial Cavity Seals lock onto lightweight ANSI rated frames that literally seal your eyes from anything the road, or weather throws at you.' so I assume they are not adjustable but the soft foam form fits around the bridge of the nose. I don't know if they will fog up. Most lenses will fog up to a certain extent when going from cold to warm conditions.
Not sure if it will work because the 'rust' lens does tend to minimize vision in lower light, of course, this is using driving at night with the 'rust' lens versus a 'clear' lens with the same prescription as an example; although never been involved in sporting clays.
Yes great pair glasses for work or play.
No
Nope, just the dark, grey lenses have UV protection.
Wiley X box and packaging three pairs of lenses, a silk bag and neck lanyard...pretty good for ballistic protection
No these exceed milspec so there are no small parts (i.e. screws, springs)
It's one big pouch and it was small. Not good for school bags. Hope that helps!

My college daughter uses it as a book/laptop bag and she loves it. I fits everything she needs for a full day of classes.
They run very true to size. I wear a size 9 which is a 42. Do not go big! Any EUR to USA CONVERSION CHART will work. It is an exccellet shoe.
I wear the same size so 39 would fit. I have a 39 which is a 71/2 to 8. So a 38 would be 7 to 71/2 and a 40 is an 8 to 81/2. I am a 71/2 so I would say they fit closer to the smaller size. So as the European size goes up or down you can calculate the corresponding American size as above.

Hi - these are men's shoes. And run true to size.
first the are very comfortable, i loved, the wight on each one whit the clipper on is 375g. or .75 lb. for me they are very light. good lock ...
Go up one size, I wear 11.5 and have 45 and my big toe rubs slightly. Rode 30 miles and had rubs on toes. When I upgrade shoes will up size. These are good entry level shoes and despite size am happy.
it is my understanding that the X5 cleat will install on a standard 3 hole (Look) system so the answer is yes. I have Look cleats on mine. Great inexpensive shoe
Yep. It has been for me for the last year and a half.
Looks like a 45 would fit a size 11.
There should be a chart on the site that tells you , I am going to guess a European 43, but look for the chart

I actually just got mine yesterday and hadn't tried to straighten it since wigs like this one can damage easily from heat and it has a tangling issue like I've mentioned in my review I did, and it had almost taken damage just from that little bit of tangling before adding hair product to tame it (Bed Head Manipulator). So if you buy it I wouldn't try to use a hair straightener on it so the wig will last longer and you get full use out of it.
Use a wig brush (the kind with metal bristles without the plastic caps on them) and carefully brush out the pigtails, starting from the bottom and slowly working your way up. The ends may be slightly damaged because of the tangles, but i if you brush them all out, only the very bottom will be slightly frizzy. To help prevent the ponytails from frizzing while you're wearing it, you can use a very thin coating of hair moisturizer rubbed into the strands. There is also a shampoo you can buy that is specially designed for synthetic wigs that helps prevent frizzing. I've found that when you're wearing it, occasionally brushing the ponytails (mainly the tips because they get the worst) can help.
No, it's very thick and the ponytails are heavy. But, my 15 yr. old daughter Loves it!
it is styled much like miku's hair the most you will have to do is rearrange the bangs to your suiting
the wig i received did not come with a wig cap, sorry that you'll have to order one along with the wig
they were styled!
We are the seller from China , We usually ship out items in 1-2 business days after we received your payment. We want to explain that we will ship parcel via HongKong Economic Air Mail, usually it will takes 10-20 business days to arrive. And unfortunately that the Hong Kong Economic Air Mail doesn't provide the tracking number, wish you can forgive this.Hope this can do you a favor, thank you for your kind understanding in advanced.
The cap size goes from Petite to average Across the head (20-22.5in) (52.7-56cm) Front to back (13.25-14.25in) (33.5-36cm) Ear to ear (10.75-11.5in) (27.5-29cm) Hope this helps!
Yes it will fit perfectly in the zippered laptop pocket.
It's the lighter green. The darker green color is way off.
The laptop pouch is 10 1/2 " wide at the top and 16" length my 15.4 laptop is 10 " by 15" and it fits perfect.....I've taken my gear in this to Scotland, Costa Rica, Colombia, as a carrier on and fits perfect under the seat as well as the overhead stuffed with camera gear and the laptop....should have bought one of these long time ago....
I dont know, i have a dell 1558 (15.6'') 37cm x 25cm x 4cm and fit very close, but you have 2cm more in the bottom to remove. I mean, if you laptop have 39cm x 25cm x 4cm should fit.
I have in mine a Sony A99 with the vertical grip battery pack, 50m 1.4 prim ,70-300mm telephoto, 17-50mm wide, two battery charges, filters, flash head in the bottom half. The top will fit your camcorder with battery, also I will take my lap-top on long flights that fits perfect. The short is "yes" it should fit.
You can put a tripod on the side of the bag. The feet of the tripod go into a bag that comes out of the side and then there are straps on the top side. No place for a sleeping bag
This is what I've carried in this bag: Canon D60 with battery pack, 18-55mm mounted, 50mm, flash and some smaller accessories. There's still room for the laptop in the laptop compartment and I guess you could fit a telephoto but not in the camera compartment if you already have all of the stuff I mentioned. That compartment is for 2-3 small lenses or 2 lenses and a flash. Hope this helps.
As you are wearing this jacket, the zipper would be on your right. Make sure the zippers match. This item is a military issue jacket, and was not designed to be zipped into the military gortex parka; this is for several reasons, one being of tactical flexibility. It is almost exactly the same as the jacket I was issued in the army in the mid-90's, except with some minor design differences that reflect a different manufacturer fulfilling the government contract.
Yes
Not sure I understand the question. As I understand it,it is worn under parka or shell jacket not zipped to it. I wear mine under a EMS shell jacket and I've not been cold even in the crazy cold weather we're having in Ma. Hope that helped.
Don't quote me but I believe Medium. I (5'8) wear a size medium t-shirt (gap, banana republic, etc) and bought a med but ended up buying a small and it's much better.
Mine was medium
Yes its US made , it has to be berry compliant
I found them on Amazon. Army surplus stores are the best place. They might not be new, but you can find good condition one's. They really are warm.
I am 5'6", 170 lbs, athletic build. I ordered S and it fits well, except a bit tight in chest.
The site from which you woule\\ The site from which you would order the jacket lists the size of the jacket. I found that a seller ususally has one size which they describe in their listing so read carefully before ordering.
Classic one, I think. And I bought just navy one.
Daypack refers to the classic size. You can also kind of tell by the picture: a mini would appear to have a larger logo badge (whereas the logo is the same size, it's just the bag that's smaller). Have a google to see what I mean :-)
Fjallraven Kanken Daypack = Classic16 litter is all same size, but Kanken has another several size bags.
Yes, they are the same size. The Kanken is 15 x 10.6 x 5.1 inches, with a 16L volume.
4.3x2.9x0.85
The colors as shown. Black silver red purple green.
Yes and they are well worth it.
Outer shell is aluminum with a plastic inner shell.
They came in a individual packaged.
I liked very much , they real.
Thats the reason I bought them. I hope I didn't get scammed. I bought the whole set because they are not real sturdy. The dividers inside come apart easily. But I like them because they are light weight and I can carry them in my front pocket easily.
Hi, I have 12 credit cards in one case, 2 cards per slot, but there's still room for a couple of small business cards, if needed. I love mine and I bought extras for gifts to family and friends.
these are randomly selected and all are available at the moment
Go to Search on Amazon and enter "aluminum hard case wallets" and order from a company that sells just one. There are many who sell just one May I suggest that Eforcity is not the best to order from. Happy shopping!

It does not beep, honk or shine. It is a dog tag that has a rubber ring around it and if involved in an accident or if you become incapacitated when medical personnel cut your clothing off they will see the medical alert ID tag and read what it says. This will let them know if you have allergies to drugs, are a diabetic of if you suffer from seizures for epilepcy or anything you put on your ID tag. Hope this helps.
yes I do - I have it set up on amazon so you should see the price when you place the order.
After the order is placed a confirmation is sent asking for the information. They actually picked up on a incorrect spelling of the drug I sent. The tag is very comfortable. Thanks
I'm 6' 3", 208 lbs., average build (no huge chest and no belly) and a LARGE fits me perfectly. According to the UA website, this is a "loose" fit t-shirt and is very comfortable and ideal for staying dry and cool while playing sports, running, or just wearing around the house. UA's size chart says guys around our size should be wearing a large (http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/size-charts) unless of course you have a larger chest or waist area than the chart suggests, then you might need an XL. Good luck!
If this is a joke, then HA. If not, then you've got to be drunk.
I have 5 different colors of this shirt and all are 100% polyester.
They seem to fit me as they should. I wear an XL and it fits me like an XL should. These are loose fit shirts, not the tight ones. Whatever size you wear in a normal T-shirt should fit the same...
Yes. My husband says that it keeps him cool when he works out.
I am 5' 10" 280 and big chest too and I ordered the 3XL and it fits me just fine. I am in between 2XL and 3XL so I have the 3XL and it fits fine.
I would go with your regular normal size. That is what I did when I ordered my boyfriend's shirt. It fit perfect. A little extra room to breathe is not going to ruin the shirt if it happens to be a lil bigger.
i'm still learning UA's category myself, i'm 190cm and 90.5kg and for the time being, L size fits me comfortably, the "compression" style needs someone more slim though would look great if you dont have obliques
Hard to say and I think it would depend on your chest size. These are not "tight" t-shirts. I am 6' 210 44" chest and it fits me fine but looks close to the picture on the ad.
The one I recieved had no texture.

no it doesn't
medium to large. large for more comfort. did u read my review of this product?
Adult sizes
It's an adult-sized jacket, geared more towards women. A man would be able to fit, but I wear M/L in terms of shirt sizes, so I bought the XL and it fit me fine. It was a little on the big side, but not enough where I wish I'd bought the large.
Yes, it has the mockingjay on it.
it's brass
In an answer up^^ it says around 10 inches. but i am not 100 percent positive.
The chain length was about 10 inches long. Hope this helps. My daughter loves this necklace.
No it is not. It broke within a month.
Hello, when ordered shipping usually takes about 5-7 days and should arrive before Christmas.! from Sisterhood Designs.
Haha that's really funny now that u say it I kind of do lol but I bought this as a gift for my best friend and I do have to say it looks better in person then it did in the picture. Lol
A inch and a half. Unless they changed it in the past few months.
I placed an order on Aug 10, 2014. Estimated delivery is Sept 29-Oct 16. 2 months!!! Wow. Sure hope it is worth the wait.
It is nice, but it is cheap. It didn't like me very much 50%
I bought mine 3 weeks before 'Catching Fire' came out. I wore it 24/7, even in the shower. It lasted for over a month. Then one of the little links on the clasp gave way. (easy fix) I still have it and plan to wear it again. It is a cool bracelet, and the brown cloth string held up very well. Worth the purchase. :)
Yes- where will it be shipping too
So far it has and I've had it for a few months now!
The bracelet measures just under 8 inches, laid out flat, from end to end :)
Yes, I couldn't be more pleased. Great value for the price!
About 17 inches from one end to the other.
Yes, it is!!!
usually&#65292;the shipping date is about 12-18 business days
it is hard to do that,sorry
Sure is. It's got that cool leather "chain" so boys will dig it (plus it represents Jennifer Lawrence). Girls like it because it's all about girl - power.
metal
Yeah,this products is producted by our factory.we have enough stock. thank you.
I bought it for my niece, but I guess it could be considered gender neutral.
It is a nice clasp!
More of a faded bronze color. I will post a pic of my pin soon.
No, it does not have a hook, just a pin that's very cheap. I ended up attaching the round mocking jay to a piece of black felt with hot glue and using a safety pin to attach it on clothing pieces.
Yes
Rose, The Mocking Jay pin is 1.5 inches in diameter, actually a bit larger than I originally thought it would be. Best regards, Ron
I don't know, my niece thought so but she may be wrong.
Yes, it was metal.
It has a tie tack (stub with gripper).
Because it is the Amazon American station. Transportation costs are too high to Australia
Yes. It says it right on the back of the pin. It is good quality though.
It is a brushed bronze, an identical replica of the movie pin.
The small fit my 10 yr old perfectly... May run small on avg adult. I don't think item is worth the price and material is plastic like fabric not nylon/windbreaker type. I was not impressed :/
I would say it's closer to an XL for women, which is usually a youth XL as well. I usually wear a size large in tops at most stores (I have a decent-sized chest), and I bought the XL...it fits me pretty well with just enough room for a thick tee shirt or thin sweater under it. It's definitely NOT an XL in men's. Hope this helps. :)
No. it does not.
Yes they do. Comes with a zippered hard case and extra-large cleaning cloth. They're great glasses in my opinion.
Yes, they are larger sunglasses.
I think they'll be fine, I have a somewhat large head I guess (not small) and these were actually a little too small on me. They're nice and sturdy, but I gave them to my dad bc of the fit and just ordered replacement lenses for my P17s.
Id go with a M. These pants are cute in traditional men sizes. I bought a small for myself and I had to roll them up four times and cuff the legs. Im 5"7.
No ,there are no pockets.
I have absolutely no idea. I must say, I ordered men's and evidently got woman's. There was no fly and it had no pockets,which is what I'm used to. So if that's what you want,it's your choice!
Sorry, I threw these away about a month ago. I repaired them twice, where they tore on the seams, but the last tear was huge and in the middle of the rear, and not worth fixing. I should update the review, it is worth saying that the person I bought them for wore them a lot and is very hard on clothing. I bought him a similar pair that were Hanes, and he has torn them already as well, so it is likely the man not the pants that is at fault.

I think so because I never weighed it. my wife wears it and feels extremely light, but I think it is suitable for spring and fall to wear.
This is the only thing I have in this brand, but it does not run as small as Patagonia. I am 5'4" 145lbs, and I got a Large. I bought it to wear in the winter over a down or heavy fleece layer, so I wanted a slightly larger size. It is roomy, but slim looking even over a t-shirt. I love the style, fit, & look of this jacket. I would think you would want a small or medium depending on what you plan on wearing underneath. Either way, it will not look like like a sac! Good luck!
I don't know the answer to your question, but I have kept dry at horse shows in flooding rains! Great fit, great look, waterproof, & tough.

Main space will probably fit two 3in, 3 Ring binders. Smaller space can fit 1-2 one inch binders. Plenty of small pockets for odds and ends.
Yes it will fit
There are 3 pockets in order as yo see the picture the first one is small, then the medium and a big one. The pocket or sleeve for the latop is the medium. I use it for my 17inch laptop and y can put there also a few magazines for example. I liked this pocket because is easy to take out the laptop once I am in the airport. I only open tbe "laptop pocket" and take out my laptop:) u can use this bag for laptop,books supolies and you will have space for more ;) I also like that is an easy carry on bag for the airport
Yes it stands up perfectly when full I don't know about the zuca
6.7 pounds according to my travel scale. It is definitely not a lightweight. Mine, fully loaded, as a road warrior tips the scales at over 40 lbs. I have not tried to use it as a backpack. Unlike my previous roller/backpack, this one is a tight fit even in the overhead bins; my old one carried everything I need and I did use it as a backpack as well as a roller bag.
The bag is actually 9 3/4" deep and does NOT fit within airline carry-on regulations. I took it to the airport and tried to fit it in a United carry-on size check box and it did NOT fit. The wheels and the hard bottom surface of the bag are too wide for the 9" dimension.
I am not sure. It looks like one and is very durable. I have mine over a year now and it is in great condition still.
It is not 9 inches but rather 9.75 inches. And that is empty. The hard bottom surface and wheels measure a firm 9 3/4 inches and that is too big for airline carry-on regulations.
My son uses the bag for middle school and loves it. Light weight and very durable. He is in school but dont recall anything flapping around. I'll ask when he gets home
yes.

The side straps are adjustable.
It was a men's bought for an average size 12 year old, bought larger size on purpose so he can grow into it... very adjustable. Excellent quality. Very happy with the vest. Highly recommend.
Unfortunately it will not. It is an adult size M-L size.
I cant find a label anywhere on it.
It's approx. an adult M-L vest with adjustable shoulder and side cinch straps.
This is a M-L vest will not fit XXL
don't know about looking slim lol but it sure makes you look like you have firmed up I got it for my back and it really makes a difference there
once you place order please write an email to us so we know the size you prefer.
I don't know. The one I got was supposed to be a large & it was a small so I returned it & never got it replaced
Small
I would try to email the seller.
Small
XL
Thighs run small. I bought a larger size and found mostly everything else fit as expected. It just isn't American size in the thighs. I still could squeeze in, and the material could handle it, but felt way tight on that one part.
Its adjust able extract and retacts. JM
excelente el envio y la calidad de la faja
Brown. I take mine to church, prob not real dressy, but I tied a cute scarf on mine and looked nice.
I have an iPhone 4 it fits that, it is longer but not wider much bigger and it wouldn't fit. Mine phone is also in a life proof case.
I am not familiar with that weapon. I have a smith & Wesson .380, very small, and it fits well.
If the Glock 17 is no bigger than 4x6 it will fit.
It comes in black or brown, but there in no place to enter which you want. Guess they just ship randomly.
It is surprisingly durable. I am very rough with my gear and tend to over-stuff. I used this bag daily for an entire semester, as well as weekend trips and the only issue I've had is that one of the buttons has come loose. It is very well made and very durable.
Yes, I carry an iPad, mac book pro and a note book and a few hardbond note books and calendars, plus all the chargers, mouse and small umbrella and sometimes even a bottled water... With space left over.
I've put a 16oz Poland spring bottle on the side and it fit just fine
No
My wife uses a 15 Inch Macbook Pro and it has room for that and all her things so I would guess yes.
It is thin in width and nicely sized so you don't look like you're on a camping trip when you're carrying it around! I'm a petite person--proportions are extremely important to me.
I believe that the size options were placed in error. There is actually only one size. You can check out Ogio's website for a video demonstration on the backpack's size and layout.
Have not tried to wash it. Have spot washed it and so far so good. This brand tends to be pretty durable.
I imagine it could. Its a canvas material. I used scotch guard on the bag when I first got it and haven't had any problems with it getting dirty or stained.
There is no size difference in the bags. Ogio, the manufacturer, only made one size. The different size options on amazon are misleading and I'm surprised they won't fix it.
Thanks! To answer your question, I just discovered 2 new pockets :). I have a 23oz water bottle, and it was a bit of a struggle to fit it in, but it eventually did slide in. I would say a standard 16oz water bottle would slide in much easier.
The only difference listed in size for the large is a width of 4.5" versus the 4" width of the medium. The product description of dimensions is otherwise the same (15 x 16.5).
It has a full zip closure at the top of the bag but it also has a small zip pocket inside the bag also.
I have no experience to suggest off of, but I would lean towards no. It's a great bag, but it's not sturdy enough to stand on its own. Therefore, I could see unsecured bottles spilling inside the bag(the interior is not water proof). The pockets on the sides are not large enough to hold bottles. There is a laptop sleeve/divider which would probably take away flexibility to store non-notebook/folder shaped objects.
Across lap top. Best purse even. I use it work. Small lap top, plus I carry worker folder in it
This bag holds up great. I purchased mine a few months ago & I am very pleased with it. I would recommended this bag.
I would estimate it at 3-5 lbs. The weight of the bag shouldn't be a deterrent to purchasing it. I have one, two friends of mine have one and I've even purchased one for my niece. Best teacher bag ever made! Worth every penny!
I specifically recall investigating this myself. I'm not current able to access the bag but remember ithe 15 inch would have to go on end and then the bag would not close. I have the large.
I purchased the teal blue and it does not have polka dot lining
The straps are not padded. I have the bag loaded but it does not dig into your shoulder.

My son has 5 years and 7 months. The costume is good fit in my son. But, I believe in next 1 year the costume will be small. My son has 4`33`` tall.
No
I'll say go for size 8. It will maybe be a little large on arms and legs but perfect for the body. An smaller size will be tight for the body.
No, it did not come with the shield.
I think they would be fine for a 3 year old, as there are no small parts and they are really fun. I think a small would be fine for a 3 year old
My 8 year old granddaughter wears a large.
My daughter is size 1 and I purchased a size medium which suppose to fit size 13.5 to 2.5. I feel like Stompeez runs small because once she's 1.5 it will no longer fit her. The slippers are cute I would had wish the size ran a little bigger.
No I bought them for kids and they were too small
I got the medium for a 4 year old and she is a size ten. Because the backs aren't closed she kept walking out of them and stumbling. The 5 year old wears a 13 and I got him an xl. I don't know what to advise on the 8 year old. Sorry?
probably xlarge cuz I bought large for my daughter and it fits me and I am a size 8, hope this help
Large for sure. Medium fits my seven-year-old and she's in a size 12.5 (children's).
I bought a pair for my granddaughter. Her shoe size is 6 ( Australian)
After reviewing other peoples answers went for large size as daughter was size 13, too big and had to purchase medium ones, hope this helps.
They are about 1/2" longer for my granddaughter's foot. She just turned 4 so a 1/2" isn't too bad. At least she will have them for a couple of seasons. She's absolutely thrilled with them.
I carry this exact combination in this bag on a regular basis. I am a motorsports photographer that covers events at Circuit of the Americas. In this bag I always have a 13" Air in the main compartment and also store my 7D (with battery grip) on top of the Mac. In the front pocket, I have my 70-200, 24-105, 1.4x teleconverter, an small external 1 TB drive, CF card reader, iPhone charger, mophie juice pack, small box of business cards, and sunglasses case. I keep a refillable water bottle that lives in the outer pocket. It's packed tight when I have all of this in there, and I prefer to keep the body and one lens on my separate sling strap outside the bag when I'm roaming the grounds. This bag will do in a pinch, but I've upgraded to the 313 model to get a bit more depth. I'd recommend doing this if you plan on carrying a Mac in addition to a proper DSLR with gear.
I use this bag 5 days a week to carry all of my stuff with me to work. I travel via motorcycle about 20 miles each direction during rush hour traffic (about 1 hour each way) and I have no complaints. I wanna put it out there that slings are probably my personal preference since when I was in high school and college and I owned a normal two-strap backpack, I generally only carried it with one shoulder anyway.
5 inches at the top, 2 1/2 where it meets the 2 inch webbing
You could definitely pull that off. The quality is second to none. So, even packed tight, the bag will eventually mold to accommodate without showing any signs of failure.
yes .it fits in nicely
It's pretty small so maybe gym clothes but I think even shoes might be a tight fit. I find a 13" MacBook Air, an iPad, charger and a notebook fit comfortably with maybe a couple of other small items. After that it gets harder to fit things.
I attempted to put a 17" laptop in this bag, and it almost fit, but it was a bit tight. I would say a 15" would fit with no problem.
Very comfortable as it has padding on the bag specifically for comfort. It also has an air channel between the pads so you can stay a bit cooler. I thought that was really neat and thought through well
Since I don't have any of those things, I can only guess. My guess is yes, though I've found when carting around that much stuff you might prefer a bag with two straps for more even distribution of the load.

It's pretty small so maybe gym clothes but I think even shoes might be a tight fit. I find a 13" MacBook Air, an iPad, charger and a notebook fit comfortably with maybe a couple of other small items. After that it gets harder to fit things.
I attempted to put a 17" laptop in this bag, and it almost fit, but it was a bit tight. I would say a 15" would fit with no problem.
Very comfortable as it has padding on the bag specifically for comfort. It also has an air channel between the pads so you can stay a bit cooler. I thought that was really neat and thought through well
Since I don't have any of those things, I can only guess. My guess is yes, though I've found when carting around that much stuff you might prefer a bag with two straps for more even distribution of the load.
Yes, the bottom does have some cushion. The back of the bag does not. The padding is actually a piece that separates the two sections; front to back.
Mine does not have this feature, no.
No this backpack is not waterproof. Despite that it has proven to be quite durable in everyday use.
I believe the sizes mean the same thing. The backpacks are the same, it's just how different sellers describe the product
It holds quite a bit - I use it for the gym and I have several books and a pair of shoes and there is plenty more room leftover.
Unless it's really long and thin I don't think a 40ounce will fit. My guess is about .5-.7 of a litre if the bottle is longer than it is tall.
It has 20 card sleeves. It's an okay product. Kind of medium quality. I wish it had pockets in the leather part and the sleeves have already ripped. But I am hard on things and have put two cards per sleeve...
14. They are very sticky. Have a hard time getting credit card out
There are 20 dividers. They are thin, but you can probably put in two per divider, so potentially up to 40.
i believe man made.
It says it has 20 sleeves, which fits up to 40 cards. That's pushing it. The sleeves rip very easily when there are 2 cards in them.
The matching accessories are not in stock, not expected to be available for at least 6 months. There are a number of other colored accessories available and you could mix and match?
You can buy this lidded Stacker separately, but not available on Amazon. Can be found in a well known container store.
The configurations have all now been standardised and none of the previous lay outs will be produced. We have launched new colors with the plusher velvet lining, Black & Fuchsia, Purple & Purple and Red & Red, check them out!
Not available on Amazon, can be found at a well known container store.
Yes. Slightly, yet securely.
You could receive either of the White Stacker configurations shown. Amazon handle the entire order and despatch process and therefore we cannot know which stock is sent out? You are more likely to now receive the new design, for example the 25 section rather than 16 section but this cannot be guaranteed.
Hi Diane We will be launching a collection of larger STACKERS, colours to be confirmed, but we would expect to see them available on Amazon around August this year. Kind regards Steve
Yes they are. The original Air Force color was smoke.
Hi, you can simply just add this item to your cart and checkout for the gold color frame. The colors listed were provided by Amazon or another seller just to let customers know of the color options available, however this listing is just for the 52mm Gold Pilots. I hope that helps clarify any confusion. Thank you, Urban Eyewear
I believe it was included with the glasses. Mine is probably void as I took them straight to the optometrist to have prescription lenses put in. Jeff
The gold lens lessens the glare from oncoming headlights as well as city lights. The gold lens also diminishes the lack of visibility when driving in fog. I would not wear anything else. Hope this helps.
The best ones I have ever found. They were standard issue for Navy pilots, and I flew A-6's for 20 years and still wear them today !
I don't know why they couldn't? I would call up to your eyeglass place/Doc and ask them if they can to be sure. They would probably have to make custom lenses though, which may not be cheap, granted of course you already have the frame. I know I have brought in frames I have had to an eyeglass place and they made new lenses, so hopefully should not be a hassle.
It appears that there are two different sizes...52 and 55 mm. I ordered the 52 because I don't like my sunglasses to look like they are clown glasses and I have a lot of sunglasses. The smallest I have are 50 but the 52 are perfect if you are the average person...if you are a bigger person and need something bigger understand that the 55 mm are pretty big. I think you'll love these sunglasses....I lost my first pair and was sick...so I ordered another pair the next day and wear them all the time.
It may be slightly small although it says one size fits all, the robe has a snug fit
No this is more like a velveteen material that simply soaks versus absorbs like a terry. It is not "fitted" so my initial thought is that this style accommodates many!
Yes, I am 5'0 and it reaches around my knees which is perfect. It isn't long and so soft.
I ordered this robe the middle of June. It is now September 2 and it has yet to be shipped. I just got a notice saying that the estimated arrival time has been pushed back even farther. So no it is not a typo it does take FOREVER to ship.
Hello Kamolpan, The robe is free size and so there is no need to worry about the hip size.
I ordered a medium, wear a size 8.5 to 9.5 shoe
In US sizes, it sounds like you should purchase a child's or woman's sock. The socks are unisex in appearance. You might find a standard sock sizing chart online for guidance.
I think they are just at the level of my crossfit shoes. They don't stick up or look weird, but they are not so low that you look like you don't have socks on at all. these are my favorite socks.
1 per pack! Great socks and are worth the money!!!
medium
I believe that is for a shoe size of 10 through 13. My husband weara an 11 and I bought a large and they fit him well. The best sock ever.
Large. They are my favorite running socks. Good luck!

Yes. The metal post is the drill bit part of the buffer bit.
I haven't washed them yet, however, I do not see any reason why they would not be washable.
Does the sharper image shiner accept drill bits? I'd imagine it would work but it wouldn't be a long term solution.
I do not have a dremal so I cannot say for sure. I can say that it has a steel post that appears to be the same size as drill bit. If your dremal can handle a drill bit, I would think it could handle this.
too much!
There are three pads as shown in the photo. I don't know how long it will last. I don't want to use it frequently because it tends to make a mess with little pieces of lint. I have only used the black one. Perhaps the other two are better.
I'm also skeptical, and even more after the response to your question.
This is a wonderful product yptht makes freshening uo my leather furniture a snap. It works quickly and efficiently.

I don't remember but I've washed them in the washer and they are fine. Just like all workout gear avoid softener I personally avoid the dryer but it may be safe
They are true to size although, depending on how much you want to struggle to get into them, you can go a size smaller. I've even got a pair that are two sizes smaller and can still get into them. That's my regular morning exercise, getting dressed.

Yes, it's hard foam. But will break if bent hard. My 7 year old plays rough with it and it's still in good shape.
Tip of sword to base 24 in long. Hilt (handle) 12 in wide.
None if prime
I am not selling this item but yes you cannot find it in stores but online, just type in minecraft foam diamond sword replica and it has some results, on think geek they have a gold sword and gold pickaxe special edition
No just the sword
Sorry, but I didn't take notice. My grandson tossed all the packing in the box, so we have no documentation. I hope someone else has that information for you!
I am not sure of the dimensions but it is big enough to hold a couple pairs of eye glasses and I have put goggles in it. I really like it. It cleans jewelry and I put my retainer in it and it does a great job of cleaning glasses.
The input voltage is 100-120 volts, Frequency 50/60 Hz, and 35 watts, Hope this helps.
It is included!! It should be in the box!
there is only one setting that i know of. i've put a bunch of stuff in there, and i think it won't damage an opal. everything goes in a plastic basket inside the machine, so your jewelry doesn't come in direct contact with the metal that lines the basin. i like this machine a lot and would recommend it for cleaning all types of jewelry!
It should be in there, they will send it to you if it is not
No. Plug in.
the tank itself is 6" long by 4" wide. the depth is about 2 3/4". hope this helps
Approximately 6 inches long by 3.5 inches wide by 1.5 inches from the bottom to the max fill line. These are inside dimensions.
It can hold quite a bit. It expands out. I have carried my laptop, iPad, textbooks and a jacket.
yes, anything larger no.
no
i have a 7' wrist so with watches that have bracelets i have to remove the cushions all other watches fit fine.
No it will not. Mine is touching and overlapping.
Yes it can but you have to put the bigger watches towards the middle, if you put them in the four corners the lid tends to rub against the side of the watch when it closes. When you close the lid down there is still space between the glass and the watch which is really good so the face doesn't get scratched.
For sure you can take out the watch cushions but I don't know about the dividers. In removing the cushions the dividers don't move and are not flexible.
So far I have 4 watched in it. Two are metal or of that type of material, one is a leather strap and one is a rubber strap. I have a fairly large wrist so my watches are bigger than most and my watches fit fine. The watch box comes with a removable pillow if you will, and all my watches fit around it perfectly. Take it out, rubber leather metal they all fit around it and fit back into the case perfectly. I know in just going on but I want to give you the best answer possible. As far as the fit, there is a decent gap in between where the watches fit and where the ceiling of the glass is and it's enough so that even if the watches stick out a little, there's still ample room for the case to close, and for the watches to remain untouched by the glass. Hope this helps!
I have a Invicta watch however, it doesn't measure at 60MM (48MM). Anyway, the sections can be removed for a very large watch. Hope this helps....
Yes it should be able to. I have a pretty big watch and it holds it
Yes it can
Yes
All women watches will not fit
I have many large size watch and they all fit.
Try using a bent paperclip to open it or a key from another jewelry box.
The slots are pretty big.
Yes
I'm not sure to how to answer that question, ours came fine has the key to lock it up all together but we didn't have any problems with it, you may consider taking it to a jewelry store and have them look at it.
Yes the plush pillows that hold the watches are removable
Yes
Salamon are gurlymon shoes and these laces aren't good at ALL!..infact asking for a refund!
Hi Andy, There is some play in the length of the laces, I believe they are 48" and you cut them to size when installing them in your shoes. I take size 10 and ended up cutting off about 2.5". In hindsight, I probably could have left them a bit longer but they work o.k. because of the elasticity. As for your size 16's, if you haven't already done so you should ask Locklace directly on their website. They have a page for questions like yours. I hope you get a good answer - it's a great product.
I don't believe they are, but I think Lock Lace has a differ t lace that is. I wear them on sneakers that have reflective logos on them
I think they'd work well, it just depends on if you'd want that look. By the way, I just did a 5K mud run on this past Saturday and I didn't lose my shoes once.
They come in a length that you cut to fit. The only thing that would prevent them from fitting is the diameter of the child's lace holes. I would check the lace hole size compared to your own and if they are similar they should fit!
I think so. They could be set so they don't even have to be undone. I can just pull mine on and off without messing with the lock unless I really tighten them down.
Not long enough. Designed for tennis shoes or sneakers
They're loooong. Unless you want them for calf-high shoes.
Two laces. One for each shoe.
No I have re-used them numerous times. Use a pair of scissors or a small flat screwdriver and push the tab inwards that clicks when you first clicked them on then pull apart. It is a little stubborn but you won't break them as long as you push the tab onwards first. After you get it open re-trim the laces and snap back together.
Yes, and you bring up a good point about tight shoe laces. Something as simple as keeping your laces tied up good might actually help prevent Achilles tendinitis! (if you do have it, suggest doing eccentric exercises like the kind in the book Treat Your Own Achilles Tendinitis). A 2010 study in the Clinical Journal of Sports Medicine showed that keeping your laces tied up did significantly reduce tension on your Achilles tendon - compared with untied laces.
i havent used them in the water, so i dont know, but i would guess yes as lomg as you got white or a light color.
But of course, it would require two locks also, but your answer is Yes!
It takes two hands to set up the lock laces into place. Mainly slipping the laces into the lock wheel because it is not difficult but not easy to hold the button down, which opens the wheel, to allow the laces to thread into. After the set up process, fit the shoe how you want it to feel while wearing them and you will never need to tighten, loosen or use two hands to slip your shoes on again.
No there would be no reason to do that. The laces are elastic and allow you to slip shoe on and off with ease and keep the laces from coming undone while exercising.
Never tried but I would think so.
I really like that I could decide how tight or loose at different parts of the shoe.
About the diameter of the laces for a pair of dress shoes. They work perfectly in my Newton Distance and Distance S running shoes.
I haven't tried them on a court with all of the lateral movement, but based on how snug they are when I run with them, you shouldn't have any issue with snugness.
Use a scissors and pry it out. Be careful not to cut yourself. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDr7-7NAblY
Yes, and tight laces prevent achilles problems too! (see Treat Your Own Achilles Tendinitis if you already have it).
1 set, 2 laces: 1 lace for each shoe.
Check out the second video here: http://www.nathansports.com/gear/performance-gear/lock-laces%E2%84%A2
~48 inches.
absolutely - they are awesome! much easier to take on and off when you get a rock in your shoe!!
The little plastic disks with two holes in them are spring loaded to bite down onto whatever is inserted through the holes, and they are separate from the laces themselves. So, yes, it should work as long as you can get your laces threaded through them (the holes are probably about 3/16" when open, so I think most shoelaces would fit).
Yes
Trying going direct to locklaces. eMail them at customerservice@locklaces.com
Cut the laces to length then take both cut ends to a flame to keep them from fraying. Place both ends into the open lock and simply fold in half till it clicks.
I just measured them - - answer 2/16 inch

47" long. Just measured an unopened package. You cut them down if they are too long.
Yes they are long enough for hiking boots
Yes
I actually don't recall, but the shoes I used them on required very long laces. I still had to cut these to make them fit.

Yes - you'll feel like your cutting off most of the lace to adjust but it'll work

I liked the design very much but returned it. I cannot answer absolutely regarding the 16 inch PC as mine was slightly smaller. My original review: While this tote may be just right for others, it was too large overall for me and my 15 inch laptop. It may be better suited for traveling than everyday type use.
Yes. With room for an iPad, as well!
I don't think so. Mine is 15" and I struggle to close the zipper if I have a number of other items in the bag. That said, I love this bag. It is comfortable to carry, practical, and super rugged, but also elegant looking. I hope this helped.
It only has the one strap, but it's long, so it's more of a shoulder strap than hand-held anyway. It fits comfortably on my shoulder.
there is a large pocket at the front on one side and I believe that there is an internal zipped pocket
Since the belt runs through the top of the chaps, we just put another belt with holsters on with the outfit. (I think that's how "real" cowboys did it anyway) ;)
Yes. It is actually a part of the chaps. It is not actually a separate belt. I hope this makes sense.
on the hat
Felt. We have had the costume for 6 months and are atill impressed with the quality/durability of outfit.

It is one size: 3-6 years.
My son will be 5 in November, fit him fine. Might be a bit big for a 2 year old. Not sure if it comes in smaller sizes.
My son weighs 46 lbs & is 43 inches tall & it fits him well with room to grow! He loves it & wears it daily! Good luck!
The star on the costume I received didn't come off the hat. The star on the vest DOES come off.
5"
As far I remember - 4" to 5"
Yep, sure does. Because of the velcro closure on the back you can adjust to make as loose or as tight as you want. Helpful for when I change hair styles. The coverage is good.
I happen to live in Hawaii, so don't know if it is the heat and humidity that helps to go back to default shape. I have a smaller brim hat that I have used for travel for several years. I have this hat hanging up right now unrolled just in the circle with velcro and it seems to have gone into the correct shape by itself. Maybe a light spray of water to soften and then shape? Sorry no real answer.
Yes. I specifically bought to shield from heavy sun and I'm very satisfied.
I have long hair so no I do not pull my hair through the top. It just allows sun to hit the top of your head while covering your face with a wide brim. I love it! Anyone with hair that is thin at the scalp would probably not want it because your head could get burned. But my hair is very thick and I like the fact that my roots get some sun.
I found this online: White Sierra Men's Size Chart S M L XL XXL XXXL Chest 36-38 39-41 42-44 44-46 46-48 50-52 Waist 28-30 32-34 36-38 38-40 40-42 44-46 I played with the spacing above which got knocked out of whack after I cut and pasted the info here. Even after that it seems to go back to having all the letters crammed together for the sizes, but you should get the picture either way. Hope that helps!

From what I can tell, they are all 30 inches on that specific page you posted with your question. If there is another page in reference to the question, then that would need to be posted with it.
Mine did not shrink. Not baggy, but a loose fit and super light. I wore them on the trail maybe 10 times and they have help up great.
Hi, Tyler, and good day to you. The inseam for these specific convertible pants when they are shorts is usually around 17". That is fairly common for most brands when it comes to convertible pants.

No I have it in large reg

Yes, that's what I received. Very cheap item, of course, but there are six.
5" Sounds a little narrow but it works fine for most of my family. (we took our family picture with these on)Incognito, you know.
They are small - they would fit smaller women, but probably not most men. Hope that's helpful
Do not buy this, they are cheap.I throw mine away...
I would go with a larger size/different style. I'm a C cup, and these give me a little boost in a regular bra, but in a bikini top they are noticeable and bulky looking because they are small and don't cover the entire width of the top.
Not sure, they're pretty heavy though. Just tested them out in my bathing suit. Needless to say, I was on a date and they kept slipping around and popping out the top... Really hope he didn't see. Totally embarrassing. I was wearing a bandeau though, maybe better if you wear a triangle bikini.
These inserts were useless. Don't buy them for any use on land or in water.
Not at all
Medium... I'm a 33" waist and the 33 is just fine
I believe these would be. Very comfortable and flexible. I use my pair for martial arts which includes intense sparring.
I use it for BJJ and it the only thing I would use.
I am a 36 and got a large. I would go XL for sure
I have the same waist size of 30 to 31 and medium is just nice.
My son is 7 turning 8 and 63 pounds. we ordered a youth lg directly from shock doctors and it fits him well. Hope this helps.
GET the LARGE even they run SMALL
Yes I switched the cup between them
Yes, they do.
Go to the Shock Doctor web site. It is all there.

I am a 36 and got a large. I would go XL for sure
I have the same waist size of 30 to 31 and medium is just nice.
Medium... I'm a 33" waist and the 33 is just fine

My son is 7 turning 8 and 63 pounds. we ordered a youth lg directly from shock doctors and it fits him well. Hope this helps.
GET the LARGE even they run SMALL
Yes I switched the cup between them
Yes, they do.
Go to the Shock Doctor web site. It is all there.

Probably, maybe just a little big. I got my ears pierced at walmart, i'm not sure the gauge, but it was just a standard size earring. When I tried to put these hoops in the gauge was just a tad too big. But after a little work I was able to put them in. And now they fit perfectly.
It's a set of 2 :)
Unfortunately your ears must be pierced. Sorry!
Flat button type; CR2032
Yes. You can change the units to metric.
I have found mine to be very accurate. Perhaps you did get a defective one and should ask for it to be replaced.
Yes.
A button battery is included. Hope this answers your question.
Details on the amazon.com site states that it weighs 4.8 ounces. It feels like ounces to me although I have no way to weigh it exactly.
I hope I can help you with your questions. I purchased these a year ago after my son was born. He weighed 7lb 10 oz and these fit him at 3 weeks of age perfectly. I would say they fit a newborn foot. As far as stretchy they will accommodate foot width but not length. He only wore them once (with a cute bunny beanie and just hatched onesie). I created an Easter basket and laid him in it for his first photo shoot.
There is no indicTion, but I bought them for my 9 month old. She is 2 and still tries to cram her foot in. They are very stretchy so she almost can. I'd guess they are intended for baby sizes 1-4
I put them on my 7 month old, she's in the 100% for height and they fit so I think they would fit a 9 month old.
Hello John: Right now we only have these available in the silver color.
They only come in silver. I am sorry!
No Sorry don't remember what they are made of. Would be very expensive if sterling. But they do NOT rust or get spots etc on them. Very nice for projects well worth buying.
E 6000 works very well. You can find it at Michaels

In my opinion they are good ,we have been using them tot play "live chess"
Yes it looks like the one in the picture...except I ordered two and one had the top piece missing..just a hole, and no piece to glue in...
Yes you can, but you can't see worth a damn.
I don't know for sure, but vision is compromised and if you turned your head to the side at over 40 mph. I expect it would blow off.
Michael, I do not believe that long hair would get in the way of the straps. There are a total of four straps and they meet in the back to form a patch that fits on the back of the head.
No, im 24 and 220 lbs and it fits my face like a glove
Only if you were to cut them out with a knife
No, Just the mask. What looks like goggles are a mesh screen that impedes vision.
NO
it comes from china.
yes! They'll take a hit quite nicely and there are pads inside to further cushion it, too.
Don't know, but doubt it.
Hi, we ship our parcels by priority airmail. This usually takes 10-12 days but occasionally they are delayed in the post or customs and can take much longer. Kind Regards Jacinabox
From the top of the shoulders/ bottom of pant leg it measures 46 inches. I hope this helps.
Hi, This item comes with a mask. Kind Regards Jacinabox
donna, its a fiberboard composite ( along the lines of plywood only thin. i have found them sturdy and durable . i have bought 6 so far. i cut and import gems and i find these are perfect for my needs ed
These drawers hold standard full size tray inserts. "Inserts are made of plastic and are covered with faux velvet. Each sectioned insert measures 14 1/8"L x 7 5/8"W x 1/2"H (360 x 194 x 13mm)" They are available mostly in black, gray, red, and white in 16 different styles. I have a 7 Slot tray for wide bracelets, a 10 slot tray for narrow bracelets, a 8 compartment tray for bangles, a 32 compartment for small earrings and an 18 compartment tray for large earrings. Take the time to look at all the tray styles and inventory what you plan to store. The comportment or slot size is available for each style. Measure the largest item for each tray type. TAKE YOUR TIME. While the trays are not expensive, it is nicer to get it right the first time. There are many, many places online to buy these. I found mine on ebay. READ THE LISTINGS CAREFULLY!!
First this is not a beautiful jewelry box. It is a utilitarian storage unit and will not stand up too abuse. The drawers are plain black. There are 16 styles of plastic inserts that fit in the drawers. These are red, white, grey or black flocked plastic -- it resembles velvet. I have black inserts and mostly silver items. Amazon sells "3M Anti-Tarnish Paper Silver Protector 2 x 7 Inch (5 Strips) 45013". I put one strip in each drawer and all my silver stays shiny.
I am not familiar with the other case.
No
The outside is 8" high x 15 1/4" length x 8 1/2" depth. The drawers are 1 1/2 " deep X 8" depth x a little more than 14 1/2 " in length.
It has 8 unlined trays like pull out drawers.
Heavy duty cardboard with vinyl covering. Just like a jewelry display tray
Without the straps it's 16 inches tall, 8.75 inches deep, and 15.625 inches wide (measured from outside edges). The individual drawers have inner dimensions of 14.25 inches wide by 7.75 inches deep. The height of the individual drawers is 1.375 inches high. I was able to fit the standard compartment trays without a problem (example: "08 Compartment Full Size Tray Liner"). If you don't fill the trays up past their own height, you can fit two trays in one drawer, one tray in first and the second tray placed on top of it. When you pull a drawer out of the unit, there is actually a lid covering it. You pull the front hinge toward you, snapping it off the little knob you see in the picture, and then you can swing the cover back to get at the contents. The lid/cover has the same black edges as the rest of the unit, but the bulk of it is transparent plastic so you can see the contents without actually opening up the lid. At first the little knobs are quite tight and it takes a lot of force to open and close the lid, but after a few times the hole loosens up so that this isn't so annoying.
Each drawer is flat and open. You have to buy the drawer inserts, but it's worth it. They are cheap. I love the clear plastic lids so you can see in without opening each one
The one I have only has 8 drawers not 10 as shown in this photo and mine measures 15 1/2" wide x 9" deep x 16 1/4 inches high.

Flocked.
Just a guess since I'm not at home to measure: about an inch and a half square
You could, very easily, with a pair of sharp scissors or a utility knife. These are definitely meant to be put in a tray or drawer, as they are not really strong enough to use without some kind of support. I have 3, stacked in a drawer, but that's a bit awkward and I'm looking for something else to keep them in.
fits the standard black plastic trays , the insert is 14 1/2 X 8 the tray is 1/4" larger in both L and W.
The 32 Compartment tray liner is a made of plastic with a velvet flocking. The tray liner is thin so it will need to be placed inside a tray for support. Thank you.
As stated in the product description the size is 14 3/4" x 8 1/4" x 1" However that is the outside dimension if you are looking for inner surface dimension its about 1/4" smaller around so the space is 14 1/2" x 8 x 3/4". It is a standard tray size so if you are looking for tray liners the standard size ones usually fit.
One Tray.
I have never put water into it. It is all one piece. I can try for you if you like.
No. They stack on top. Whatever's inside would be safe as long as it isn't taller than the sides of the tray.
I did not locate any letters like that just the country of origin.
It appears to be a hard plastic.
its 15 inches by 9 inches. these are from the outside to the outside, not the inner tray which can be bought separately. its one inch deep.
I don't remember, sorry. but I recall being happy with the purchase.
sorry for not responding soon. it is the following: height 40" width 19" depth 13". The quality was awesome, I am very pleased.
A couple of drawers have divider sections, not so that you can hang earrings, but just lay them in the divider sections. I have 3 or 4 pair in each section.
Top section has the ring roll for lots of rings.
yes, a few have small dividers. I think only the top 3 or 4 drawers. the bottom drawers do not have dividers.
Mine seem to stay level.
The "hidden" part refers to the doors that are on each side that have a magnetic push in button on the inside. You just push the door on the top right side to get it to open. I can't remember but I believe the key was in the top area or in one of the drawers...
No. Only the lower drawers and top. The sides remain unlocked.
No clue. But expect the item to show up with excessive damage.
Unfortunately it does not lock.
Yes, the sides lock. There is room for long necklaces without tangling.
My son is 12, small/thin, about 5' and under 100 lbs. He takes a youth large.
Bought these for my 12 yr old & they fit perfect. I would say they're true to size. Hope that helps! Good luck!
My son wears a size 10, and the medium fits him perfectly.
No.

I ordered the large for a 12 year old. This was bigger to allow for growth so it was not fitted. from Under Armour Web site: UA BOYS' SIZE CHART US sizes Chest (in) Waist (in) Height (in) YXS 7 25-26 22-23 48-50 YSM 8 26-28 23-24 50-54 YMD 10-12 28-30 25-26 54-59 YLG 14-16 30-32 26-27 59-63 YXL 18-20 32-34 28-29 63-67
Yes - with UA, youth and big boys is the same thing
My guy is 6. Size small was a bit long but fit well enough for him to wear and looked great. He is very happy with it.
Under Armour fits pretty true to size. My son absolutely loves his ColdGear long sleeve shirt!

I purchased the 9-11 size because I have shoes that vary from size 8 to 9 and a 1/2.
no I bought it for high heels and it didn't work
yes.
Its shape is arched so I'm not certain if it will fit your boots. Mine broke after a few uses. If I was you I wouldn't waste my money buying it. Look for an alternative.
One pair is two stretchers that stretch in two different directions. I returned these as they were not well made.
It should if used in conjunction with kiwi shoe stretcher spray....or the spray by itself ifyou can stand to wear the shoes while their stretching after you sspray the insides
it should. It widens out to width you need. I stretched several sandals.
I found this on another site: Sizing is as follows: Small fits men's shoe size 5 - 8.5 / women's shoe size 6.5 - 10 Medium fits men's shoe size 9 - 11 / women's shoe size 10.5 - 12.5 Large fits men's shoe size 11.5 - 13.5 / women's shoe size 13 - 15 X Large fits men's shoe size 14+ / women's shoe size 15.5+
These are intended for running so I'm not sure how how they'd work for hiking.
Easy answer, get the medium. I am a size 9 male, my size 10 female partner fits in them perfectly. Additionally, they stretch fine over winter boots this crazy cold snowy and icy roads. One caution- the added traction is great but adds a great deal of strain while running on soft tissues, muscles and tendons. Just run a few miles, not tenners.
They have a size chart at https://www.yaktrax.com/product/run
They appear to have a lot of adjustment in width to them. I might consider going the next size up mainly due to length.
I have both types--I prefer the running ones, especially on solid ice.
They are marked inside the heel on each. Foolproof!
at least a large..i take it u mean us size 11.5 thats 10.5 in uk i think...at least a large..med will be 2 small..im a size uk 9 n they will stretch a bit...but i dont think a med would stretch that far..it might do..but its going to weaken it stretching it so much i reck....happy new yr

What it says is accurate. I've flown several times with this as my carry-on, with the front pocket expanded and it has always fit, no matter which airline.
I get 19.5"x15"x7". The depth is a little hard to measure. 7" goes from the very bottom to the zipper. The handles run down the bottom and there is also another zipper to expand the depth a little. Hope that helps.
Unfortunately no.

Since these are breast forms only, and don't come with any sort of bra attachment, you just choose whatever size cup you want. I bought all 4 sizes they sell, and there was not much difference in size between their A and B cups. They are very nice.
Yes you can. They are very comfortable
Thats roughly what it will make you if you were completely flat chested
I thought I was a 34 B until I got these. They are nice and full and I would say a full B cup. All I know for sure is that they are WAY bigger than I thought I am!! They are nice, realistic inserts.
I dont use adhesives and no they dont come with adhesives. I have tried other forms that are made specifically for use with adhesives but found them uncomfortable and the adhesive didnt work very well.
No, they would be a little too big for a 34a
I wear mine with ordinary bras. Never tried the beach, but have worn them in all kinds of hot sweaty weather with no problems. This is an incredibe bargain.
No these are not self adhesive. They do however sell a medical grade adhesive you can buy on Amazon Or your local costume s hop.
All of our breast forms come in pairs, so you will get two identical breast forms in the box. You can order 2, but then you will have 2 pairs.

After I placed my tall boots in it there was plenty of room for my helmet also.
Yes
No, it is all one .

Great boot bag,and is made to hold a pair !

Hello, this will take 2-5 business days, you will not have to sign for anything. Thank you!
You arent missing anything! It is fairly easy to roll with this once you know how. I learned by looking up a video on YouTube, it tells you everything you need to now for rolling with this kit! It is a great kit once you know how to use it correctly! Best of luck
No, they won't be able to tell... I got mines in a envelope package :) I am unsure about the description though, for I have forgotten.
It arrived in a discrete yellow package, seller return address was also on package, hope this helps
The one I purchased did not come with a water bladder and drinking tube.
No it does not.
It holds 1 liter.
It's a sipping device to sip water from the built in water pack.
The solar panel charges a battery powered usb hub inside the bag, that can be removed, and will only charge devices that use charging cables via usb.
Yes, I have charged my GoPro camera during the day. Essentially there is a battery pack connected to the solar panel. As long as you only charge things from the battery pack in full sunlight you are okay. In my experience you never want the battery pack to lose it's charge (like by charging something overnight). Once the battery pack has lost it's charge you have to plug it in to a power source. Again, that's my experience. I've never left it out multiple days to see if it will charge back up. Overall I've been happy with the backpack.
yes i just did
I don't think it does. I got this for my son. I wouldn't get it, though. The water bladder was broken when he got it. Since I had purchased this early for Christmas, I couldn't return it.
Yes
The dimensions listed for these tags is 6.4 x 3.2 inches so I would guess anything slightly smaller than this would fit. The Carnival Cruise tags we used fit perfectly when folded as instructed.
8 tags and 16 straps, 8 long straps and 8 regular straps
Hello Ivanka, this is to do with Amazon Prime Service - you have to sign up for a membership annually. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DBYBNEE/ref=nav_prime_try_btn thank-you Paul Blair
All the loops were the same size in the ones we got. I'm in a hotel now and have no way to measure, but I would guess they're 6 inches long. It's easy to slip the card through them when attaching to the bag. The size of the tag is perfect for our Holland America tags.
Honestly, I would give them 2 sets just in case 1 or 2 should break. They're not that expensive and well worth the investment and then you're sure your clients have enough tags. I wish my travel agent had done that for me when I was on the Royal in April.
Yes they fit. I did have to trim them slightly.
The tags are all one size. They were perfect for Carnival Cruise Lines, but I do not know about the others. They worked perfectly and are sturdy. Will be able to use them again.
Yes! I actually purchased them for my 5 year old son
Combined, but all the little feathers are glued onto cheap cardboard individually and fall off as soon as you put the wings on. Buyer beware--these wings are not worth the price!
Yes, they'd fit although you would have some big wings. They attach by elastic shoulder straps that can be tied or crossed to make a better it.
The center piece rests between your shoulders of your back, there is 1 inch thick elastic to hold them, and the wings themselves stand out from the back. We used them for our Christmas Angel in The Nutcracker and they worked great. Only thing is it's somewhat fragile, so had to re-glue some feathers.
Thank you for your interest in our Products. We do have them in Black however we are currently out of stock on that item as well as similar black wings that we carry. We won't have our next shipment in until December, I'm sorry for any inconvenience. Thanks, Customer Service
Both but really matted down. I would no buy again.
It's a good size for an adult. I'm 5.4 it fits well.
Most def
The shoulder straps would be tight (but easy to modify) but width and height it would fit perfectly.
they are 100 percent nylon, they are washable, however I hang to dry, as they dry quickly. I find nylon is better not put in the dryer. I wash mine about every two weeks in cold water and a tiny amount of Clorox. They are still like new after two years.
Right now we have a limited-time Special ! We are shipping same day ALL orders recvd before 3 pm Eastern, otherwise next morning, by Priority Mail to reach you in 2-3 biz days.
I measured this bag and it is 15" length and 17 and a half across It does hold alot because I bought these bags to help me move. They were great for that but also to use for whatever especially when I go to the grocery they do hold a lot I just love these bags. Tricia
I don't know about weight limit. The material is very thin. I bought them for shopping clothes in places where it cost 5 cents per shopping bag. It's good for beach towel, change of clothes and maybe one pocket book or e-reader like iPad or Kindle, sunscreen. I hope you get idea that it's not sturdy for books.
they are turned down about one inch and sewn top and bottom, with x stiches where there would be stress. I have washed numerous times, however hang to dry and have not had any fraying. They have held up really well for me as they are washed frequently. I use the to put anything that may leave a stink or residue in my bag and wash as soon as I get home. They have just been a lifesaver for me as I have ruined many other kinds of bags laundering. I could not be without mine.
No, I'm sorry they don't.
The listing is for FIVE per order. If you require ten, please enter quantity of TWO @ $14 = $28 (Free Shipping included). We have plenty of these available, all New, of course. many thanks.
The bag is 16" long and 17.5" wide. The handle is 12" from where it folds at the top down to the bag. It fits on the shoulder well, or you can tie it in a bow easily. I hope this helps. I love mine.
I used this with a roof rack, which worked great. But they do sell car clips (separately) that allow you to attach to your door frames, like the traditional hardhshell cartop carriers from the past.
I ran the straps through the car with the doors open and not through the window. The doors closed just fine.
If it is packed full it isn't bad at all. If it is just half full then it flaps around. You have to be more careful strapping it to the roof when there's loose material to flap around.
Yes you can still use it. Though you may have to open your doors and run the side straps through the inside. There are videos on this product that will show you how to do it.
I honestly think that it would work for it. I would just make sure to reinforce it with some ratchet straps.
I went to the right line website to find the correct size for my truck it was the perfect fit. You can enter your vehicle information to find the right size for your car. Installation was very easy.
I would think so. We have a 2009 Matrix and we put the straps through the inside of the car.
We attached ours with a stronger strap, the ones included didn't seem heavy duty enough.
mine was torn and had 1 strap completely broken after 1 week's use. I can still use it, but it is not rain proof and i have to use extra motorcycle straps to secure it. i do not recommend this with or without a rack! i went out and bought a rack and cheap plastic shell and it works much better.
Don't think so, I bought it to display a small sculpture that I purchased, and I tested it out by putting something on it that was not breakable, and it vibrated so much that it shook the item off
I don't have mine with me right now but I don't believe it could handle anything heavy even over a pound. The rotation wheel below the platform is not very sturdy. it is a 2 inch wheel with little calibrations coming off of it that spins against another wheel that is smaller. They are both made of plastic. Better for displaying jewelry or some small object.
20cm, so almost 8 inches
Ir is Plastic, I don't know what kind of project you have. But there is not much space underneath, unless you fix it in the border. There is about aone centimeter around it. Other than that in the middle, it probably will touch the gear that makes movement. The piece is good and works well, but it is intended fork light objects and I hope you are not planing to use for smithing heavy
I have no clue as it vibrated so much nothing would stay on
It can hold a large necklace display nicely, I used it for displaying jewelry.....
No. D batteries only.
I can't remember the exact but, because I use it as a display for jewelry it works perfect. It works great revolving just enough
I'm thinking that would be too heavy for it to spin properly.
That's a good question. I'd say I think it wouldn't have a problem up to two pounds or so. It's relatively well built for the money. Maybe more. What is it you're wanting to display?
Men's Small (6 Wide- 8 Narrow) Men's Medium (8 Wide- 10 Narrow) Men's Large (10 Wide- 12 Narrow) Men's X Large (12 Wide- 14 Narrow) Men's XX Large (14 Wide- 16 Narrow) from the review by PR Marchesano in the review of these trees!
I wear size 8 to 9 men's and medium was almost to large. A small should suffice for women's 8 (mens 6).
According to the web site, they have these options: 31011 Men's Medium (8 Wide- 10 Narrow) 31012 Men's Large (10 Wide- 12 Narrow) (source: http://moneysworth-best.com/products/special-care/shoe-trees-shapers/31010-cedar-shoe-tress-with-hook-heel/) If you refer to my review, I ordered the "right" size for a size 15 (XXL) and got a shoe tree that was marked XXL, but which doesn't come close to fitting my shoes - way to small. So my advice to you would be to think about how you fit in the 9.5's - are you hoping the shoe tree will stretch them for you, or do you just want something to keep the shape and take care of moisture? Then order either the Medium or the Large depending on the answer. Also, see this review "3.0 out of 5 stars A Little Too Small, May 6, 2013" from Jay T Johnson, who wears the exact same size.
They would fit a D or E (US) width. I couldn't see them fitting in smaller than a medium width, but they do spread a bit to a slightly wider width.
They're right and left specific.
Each order comes with a pair. As a side note, I found the shoe trees to run a little small.
Your question is not clear. What are you asking?
My best guess is x large- I like mine to fit TIGHTLY and really straighten the sole out and get rid of ANY creases-I am size 8.5 and I use a large and its tight- it would be too small for 10.5- so XL in my opinion-best to try one pair as trial -
go with a large.
I would assume size large. I wear a size 9 and got a medium so 12 would most likely be outside the Medium range.

it is a high quality plastic
We've been very careful with it so it's hard to say... It works great though even seven months later.
I'm not sure the actual weight, but it was still pretty light with the wand in the box. Less than a pound.
The light is bluish white I guess, and yes, the battery is easy to change.
Hi Ivania! Thank you for your interest in our products. Yes, this item needs batteries and they can be changed. It uses 3 AAA batteries. The light is as shown in photos, clear white light.
No
Like circumference?
I don't know. I got this for my Granddaughter and she was very happy with it. As far as I could see when she opened it, it only lit up but it was exactly what she wanted.
It's bright enough to see but not obnoxiously bright. You can change the level of brightness as well. My son loves his.
double AA
The drawers open easily but don't pull out all the way so they won't fall out. It causes a bit of a problem getting things out of the back compartments in the top two drawers.
Each of the top two drawers are divided into six sections. 3 x 3 of equal side. The rest of the drawers are lined the same but are not divided. All the drawers you see in the photo are actual real drawers - I say this because when I was looking to buy this I saw some where the bottom two drawers were actually just one big drawer. Also note that the whole unit comes in one piece - it's already assembled, it's not flat-pack - you do however have to put the top lid using the screws provided.
The sides accommodate necklaces. Both sides of the piece open to allow hanging of necklaces
It is 45" high and it is made from real wood.
No
Thank you for posting your question. According to the manufacturer the actual dimensions are 19L x 13W x 40H inches. Hope this helps
No the sides do not lock. This is a nice solid piece of furniture. My only complaint is that the drawers don't pull out all the way so it is difficult to get things out of the back compartments of some of the drawers.
This armoire has a deep brown red with a satin finish. If you do a Google image search for "wood finishes Benchmark design group" the color matches the Dark mahogany on maple sample. It matched most of the better quality furniture that you can get from Levin and other major furniture suppliers. I purchased it for my wife as a B-day present. She has expensive taste and loved this piece. Some notes to be aware of; The lock is only for the drawers, not the top or side panels. Also the piece is very heavy. You will have to assemble the top, it is packed separately to protect it during shipping. It is also packed in allot of packing cardboard, foam and tape. This is the type of furniture that you will keep for a life time. It is well made and worth every penny.
its just a buttonyou push it does not lock
No it does not I had to play with it till I figured it out.
yes. I use it instead of my usual big brief case when I go on interviews. very nice. leather looks great
I wear 11.5-12, I ordered 45, they are almost loose. If you want them snug, go with 44.
You can walk in these but not for long. They also don't have much grip for wood cement and most walking surfaces.
Yes. I'm an 8 and it fits perfectly
Yes, easily.
I would buy a different brand. These were very very narrow in the toe and ball of foot.
I wear between a 9 and 9.5 US and ordered a size 43, which fit fine. I would order the 44, and plan to wear thicker socks initially.
No, they clip on both sides.
I wear 11 in Adidas and 11.5 in Nike since they run narrower than usual. I ended up buying the size 45 and they fit me great! Hope this helps! -Amir
I wear basically a 10. I measured my foot and went by the size chart, and the shoes fit great.
These shoes run a little big but fit me well because I got wide feet, they are super light and comfortable. You should purchase 1/2 size smaller. I am happy with them. Hope this help

Anthony , I am 5'7 with 32"-33" waist . I got a large, and they fit great,but just a little long for me. So you being 6'5 , you might want to go XL, for the lengh .
Yes, there are two nice sized pockets. One on each side.
Wellshear?? XL fits me great...im 6'2, 205...
They're like sweat pants. They're very different than T-shirt material. If you've never experienced under arm our material you'll love it! Also, the bottom of open... Hope this helps!!
I can read the tag when I get home. They are cotton/fleecy on the inside and polyesterish w a slight sheen on the outside.

Yes with cold water and hang dry
you can get size "S" if you want tightly,so it is my advise.
No, these are the basic Skins material.
The 2 pair of the unisex compression calf sleeves (that I own) are UV 50+ rated, according to the SKINS website.
Not sure. I have bought sleeves before so I had an estimate of my size. The only thing I would say is they stretch pretty easily so I would go smaller rather then larger.
I will say yes because I been running in Arizona for like half a year with these skins, but then again that's me.
I'm 6', 155 pounds, and also have a 14" calf and I wear the Small comfortably. These things are wonderful!
I would say either the L or XL. Obviously the L will have more compression on a 19" calf but the XL may not have enough compression for you.
I would definitely order a small, I am 6'2 and my legs are the same circumference and the medium was too big and stretched the entire length of my leg, someone at your height from what I've seen would have to go small, possibly xsmall if the small ends up being too long, I was able to return the mediums no problem in exchange for the smalls.
Yes, that's for a pair

I would definitely order a small, I am 6'2 and my legs are the same circumference and the medium was too big and stretched the entire length of my leg, someone at your height from what I've seen would have to go small, possibly xsmall if the small ends up being too long, I was able to return the mediums no problem in exchange for the smalls.
Yes, that's for a pair
The one that I got is a loose fit.
Only the Under Armour Catalyst series has SPF protection, to the best of my knowledge.
No, the material in this shirt helps release heat and mositure from your skin. Where UA makes a different type of material to help keep your bodies heat in (cold gear).
I think they are made of polyester. They will shrink a little bit if you over dry them but ive washed mine 3 or 4 times now and they're still like new.
Unfortunately i don;t have any link for that. After failing couple times with sizes i figured out which one fits me for different gear.
No i couldn't. i picked up L size which i usually wear but this was too big for me.
My guess would be youth. I personally have a Large that fits well, and I'm 5'11 and 230lbs. Best of luck.
Exactly it's Purpose!
Yes, Karen. It fits loosely, not a compression shirt. My husband is 5'11" 183# and it fits a little looser than his T's. He wears a Large. It doesn't shrink.
I usually wear Medium but this time bought Large and it's too big for me. I think just Large will be okey.

Not sure exactly what the question is, but ive been using these for a year during CrossFit WODs, and they have kept the same great level of compression since day 1. Awesome socks.
Great socks For both. BTW I never received my 4-5 pair I ordered...no FEDX or.UPS receipt.....haven't seen them.since
yes
No tag. They appear tto be cotton and have spandex. They are well made, the warmest cf socks I have! Deff not thin and cheap. Great for cold days.
This is a clasp one and it has not been tested for lead, that's a good question.
No this is light. Just a toy like u see in cvs or something.
I don't know what you mean. This one I bought has a button on the back yo turn it on and it lights up.
Yes
Not sure I understand your question, but the item pictured is the same item I purchased and looks as shown.
No and no. I have used it on dark and light leather and it does not seem to do anything more than give the leather a shine.
Absolutely! I live in a very cold, snowy climate near Lake Superior. I put this on my leather Sorel boots and it keeps them looking new. It doesn't make them water proof but protects them from regular wear water exposure.
It only provides a protective coating. You should apply before polishing.
Yes I would say it does. I live in s very snowy, cold climate with a lot of snow and ice and I've had no problems with salt stains. It wouldn't work for suede, though.
It might make it slightly darker, but the color shouldn't change much. If they were mine, I'd do it.
Would not endorse this. Faux could be most any material... so if you try it, test it on a spot that is not visible.
Yes. If the leather is shiny and textured it will be perfect, think croc print or similar. If the leather is suede then this will darken the suede a bit.
It dries quickly and I polish afterwards, so I have not encountered any problems. Mind you this is not a cream like polish that can have access material in a place. This will either be absorbed or dry so not much left to stain clothes with.
I don't know why you couldn't, as long as it is smooth leather and not suede. It is a light protection, so I wouldn't count on it in the arctic circle, but a single coat continues to protect my leather shoes as I walk through wet grass.
I am sorry, have never experienced this?
I always machine was/dry them and after at least 10 times they look like new...no shrinkage or pilling. A great, comfortable investment.
That is actually a good range of temps for these pants!
Sadly, no. I still love them, they are very comfortable but having no pockets is the one drawback
Yes
I didn't look for one - if it's any help- I'm 5'8 and 200# - 33" inseam - thes fit great - not tight - very comfortable - I bought an XL.
No, no fleece at all. Extremely comfortable stretchy pants, great fit and warm but I have to wear cuddle duds (warm thin long underwear) in winter here in Colorado. No lining, no pockets but I LOVE these pants. I have 6 pairs!!!
Hi there - they may be. I am 5'6" and they are a perfect length. Even after multiple washings they have not shrunk (and left me with high waters like so many other cotton slacks and PJs)
Gary, I am 5'6" and weigh 160 lbs. I bought an extra large in the ladies pants. They are a little big through the thigh area, but the length is not a problem.

Hi there - they may be. I am 5'6" and they are a perfect length. Even after multiple washings they have not shrunk (and left me with high waters like so many other cotton slacks and PJs)
Gary, I am 5'6" and weigh 160 lbs. I bought an extra large in the ladies pants. They are a little big through the thigh area, but the length is not a problem.
I always machine was/dry them and after at least 10 times they look like new...no shrinkage or pilling. A great, comfortable investment.
That is actually a good range of temps for these pants!
Sadly, no. I still love them, they are very comfortable but having no pockets is the one drawback
Yes

Both sides are the same. I just had my daughter double check and both sides are identical.
Unisex.
The 7th Doctor
It has only 3 alarm settings.
It illuminates the entire face.
I have like the wrist of a small skinny child and this watch fits great. I haven't measured my wrist but this watch will fit you most likely and is surprisingly comfortable. I wear mine everyday all day and use the notch that is one away from not being able to wear it at all. Buy the watch. And I am not a timex salesman although I should be getting paid for this product endorsement.
I am not that smart in terms, I can give you tape measurements of screen: H 7/8 in, W 1 1/8 in and frame: H 1 3/8 in, W 1.5 in, biggest W from side button to button 1 7/8 in, belt narrow part W almost 1 in (I oriented H and W to the picture)
Not that I am aware of...it is more of a beeping crescendo...I'll be honest...I'm a light sleeper and have slept through the alarm function numerous times...but it may work for another person...it is nice to have three settings and I still utilize it for a back-up alarm...
No time zone differentiations. You manually change everything. Love this watch for the size, but honestly, people think it is WAY more high tech than it is when I'm wearing it. I've had - does it have a GPS or all these other functions. Just your basic time, chrono, timer, 3 alarms...for me it is all I need!
I believe they are the same size since I bought a green one and have seen the other belt ones on other peoples hands.
China
That is the CHRONO function on the watch. You find it went press the MODE button, and it will say CHRONO.
Not sure about that one. I did it manually but see what the instructions say. Maybe you'll find something I didn't.

They are glass...should be perfect for putting on makeup. I have one of these and gave one to my mom too. We both love them.
The magnetic closure is very strong so the mirror would not go flying open. It takes two hands for me to open it. However, to keep the entire armoire from rattling around when the bedroom door is opened/closed, I would highly recommend securing the bottom of it to the door with a few pieces of double sided tape and/or the screw that is provided to use at the bottom of the armoire, if you were attaching it to a wall. I read this advice from other reviewers and they are very happy with the outcome. After hanging this myself, this advice makes a lot of sense! Just make sure you have clearance behind your door that allows for the depth of the armoire. It's a really great piece at this price and I'm recommending it to all my friends/fam!
It comes with over the door hangers. Easy to do.
I ordered the white mirror and my hooks are white
It was packaged very well - wrapped in lots of bubble wrap - was in perfect condition when it arrived.
No but it's not really easy to open for a child you probably can put a lock on it and you'll still love it
14 inches wide, 4 foot tall, 4 inches deep
no but it has a strong magnet which keeps the door closed
I doubt it - I hung mine on the back of a door - but it is almost 4" deep
Doesn't on mine. I also hung it on the closet door.
48"x 14" x 3.5"
It did not come with any paperwork, that I recall. Mine broke within the first 3-4 months of having it installed - completely fell apart off the wall. The company refused to work with me. I actually purchased it as a Groupon, and it was Groupon who refunded me the money. The company did not offer to have it replaced or give me any money back.
My husband mounted it and didn't have any problems. I would recommend mounting it and not using the door hanger part. He used the screw wall mount things.
I've had this product for 2-3 years and have not noticed any tarnishing of my jewelry (even the cheap jewelry)!
The case is held to the wall by its back piece. The frame and the weight of the case are held to the back by tiny little tacks (think staple strength) After 2 months the back began to separate from the weight of the rest of the case. I could hear the foam (the jewelry sticks in foam) begin to tear. Like a Velcro sound! We had to set it back on the floor. My husband will try putting "L" brackets on the inside to connect the top of the frame to the back. If we would have hung it when I first got it I would return it, but it took me several months before we hung it. I wish I could return it.
The majority of the inside is a velvet type covering. There is a mirror about 14" x 12" and A LOT of brass hooks for necklaces, etc. It hold many pieces of jewelry and whatever.
Necklaces may have to big baubles or beads, better for small linked necklaces.
The door does swing open 180 degrees. As for changing which way it opens... if you are skilled with tools and are very careful you might be able to take the hinges off and switch it around, but i wouldnt recommend it
If you stand far enough back and mount it at the properly then yes. Dimensions are in the description.
I would say it depends on where the organizer is placed , such as in a bathroom, or in a bedroom , a bathroom area would present more humidity issues . also the type of heating system one has . electric is a dryer heat while gas heat emits nore moisture. so far my wife has had no problems with her jewelry and the organizer is in the bathroom
The instructions include a template to help you drill holes into the wall, but you can recreate it. The template is just a sheet of paper with two round circles drawn on it. The circles have diameter just over .25", and they are 10.2" apart (midpoint to midpoint). The paper says "PLACE TEMPLATE AGAINST THE PENCIL MARK ON THE WALL AND TEMPORARILY TAPE PAPER TO WALL." Full hanging instructions are: Step 1: Using a pencil, mark off a starting area on wall. We recommend that you hang the mirror between 64 to 68 inches from the floor. Step 2: Hold the enclosed template on the wall and using a level make sure the paper is straight. Drill through the paper where the holes are marked for holes and anchors enclosed. For anchors enclosed, you will need a 1/4 inch drill bit. [I'm pretty sure we just used 1/4" nails and hit them into the wall, because we didn't have a 1/4" drill bit.] Step 3: Be sure screws protrude 1/4 inch from the wall. IMPORTANT: Be sure to use the right hardware for your type of wall. Mollies and special anchors are sometimes necessary for certain walls. [That's what the instructions say, which is pretty useless. The accompanying photo shows that you should use a hammer to tap the anchor into the wall and then screw in the screw.] Step 4: Hang unit on screws and using the counter sunk washer (included) screw in the 3rd screw, on the bottom, to secure item to the wall. You are now ready to organize your collection in your Jewelry Armoire Mirror.
It arrives assembled unless you want to use the door hooks which you'd have to install those.
No, you do not. You do need to screw the mount onto the back of the mirror to your desired spots on the mount. Then it just hangs over any door you'd like. It is super easy!
That's a difficult question to answer because it depends on how you organize the earrings and what type of earrings are being organized (hooks, hoops, posts, studs). There are 100 slots in the door for earrings - I think best for hoops and hooks. Then, some or many of the ring slots in the mounted base can be used for posts and studs, and there are 52 rings slots of a typical size, and 12 large enough to hold a small bangle bracelet. Hope this helps.
I would say they are plastic covered with black felt. I've had mine a year, maybe longer, and it has held up very well.
Most of mine overlap from the top row but it's not that bad. You can still see and access them okay. I love this jewelry holder!
Yes but only in the bottom set.
I would say that you can add one .... Be sure to wall mount and bolt this if security is a concern otherwise some one would just walk off with it under their arm LOL :)
No
Yes there is a mirror on the inside.
Mine works perfectly fine under led lighting in a glass display case
It is all solar and will spin with very little light levels. 10 ounces is an upper limit, really causes those delicate plastic gears to grind. (I took one apart; I don't recommend it unless you enjoy delicate puzzles). No battery.
Not sure why you would want it upside down but I just tried it and it does woek
We post the item via usps from China.
I have an 8 oz. crystal on one....that's about max...more weight is not practical even though it may still rotate.....it bends the little axle the table sits on.
about 10cm square unit
Not waterproof but repels water well and dries quickly.
I think 34 regular is ok
Mark I bought 2 pair, both same size , one pair fit perfect, the other pair same size printed must hAve been labeled wrong because they were about 3 sizes to big.
Dear Amazon, why do you have to ask me? Isn't it your job?

Dear Amazon, why do you have to ask me? Isn't it your job?
Yes, but I don't think it's really designed to do that. Is my comment posted about this portfolio - the slot on the right is too small for a standard 8 1/2 x 11 pad of paper. It's about 8 1/4" !! The pad they give you is about 8 1/4". After that good luck getting another pad in the slot. I told people not to buy it. If you don't plan on using the right hand side to hold paper. then I guess it's ok.
Of course, a standard yellow/white pad fits
No, it's vinyl but very nice!
Yes it would. It's easy to replace.
It is tight but does.
I wouldn't call the padfolio soft, but it's not super firm - a bit of bend to it.
No. Even a half inch notepad would be pushing it. This portfolio is designed for standard thickness pads.
No it's not large enough.
No, I don't think so. never tried it but it looks too tight.
I do not know, I don't have that calendar book to test it.
I think the lid has to be open after winding in order to play.
I am sorry, but I have never seen the box, because I had it sent to my sister as a gift.
"That's What Friends Are For"
thank you for being a friend.. its a good touching song and was very fitting
The music box plays very well and clearly.
It's like three by six inch standard music box size though.
You should be a SMALL... This is UA's MEN'S TOPS SIZE CHART - Chest (inches) SM = 34-36, MD = 38-40, LG = 42-44, XL = 46-48, & XXL = 50-52
If I have it tucked in as an undershirt no not at all but untucked it rides up but I got a slight beer gut my friend who is smaller has no issue
Depends on how you want it to fit its a compression shirt i personally use it for working out If you want loose fit go one size up from what you wear.
I have a fairly large chest, pant size 36. I buy large and it's pretty snug but that's how I want this kind of shirt to be. Going off of the pants size I'd assume he's a little bigger than I am so I wouldn't go any less than XL. (If he wants it snug) I'd also suggest maybe going to a sporting goods store and trying them on then buying from Amazon.
I am 6'6" 215 44 inch chest. I ordered a XL and the length is great. A couple inches longer than regular tank t-s. I have a longer torso too
hi - my hubby has only worn the under armour so I am unable to help you. sorry!
It might. It should adapt to your hips by the shape. I would recommend a medium if your bust size is 32 or larger. These are tight fitting, yet comfortable
Well I have the medium shirt but I would recommend to try to get your proper size since the shirt tends to rise over time plus a smaller size than normal might restrict some movement
It's more compression in that it's snug fitting (to show off that Under Armour body!) It is not compression like compression shorts or cycling shorts. I wouldn't be surprised if UA offers a line of apparel like what you're looking for, but the Heatgear line probably won't do what you're wanting.
These are to wear under a bullet proof vest to keep you dry or for working out

You should be a SMALL... This is UA's MEN'S TOPS SIZE CHART - Chest (inches) SM = 34-36, MD = 38-40, LG = 42-44, XL = 46-48, & XXL = 50-52
If I have it tucked in as an undershirt no not at all but untucked it rides up but I got a slight beer gut my friend who is smaller has no issue
Depends on how you want it to fit its a compression shirt i personally use it for working out If you want loose fit go one size up from what you wear.
I have a fairly large chest, pant size 36. I buy large and it's pretty snug but that's how I want this kind of shirt to be. Going off of the pants size I'd assume he's a little bigger than I am so I wouldn't go any less than XL. (If he wants it snug) I'd also suggest maybe going to a sporting goods store and trying them on then buying from Amazon.
I am 6'6" 215 44 inch chest. I ordered a XL and the length is great. A couple inches longer than regular tank t-s. I have a longer torso too
hi - my hubby has only worn the under armour so I am unable to help you. sorry!
It might. It should adapt to your hips by the shape. I would recommend a medium if your bust size is 32 or larger. These are tight fitting, yet comfortable
Well I have the medium shirt but I would recommend to try to get your proper size since the shirt tends to rise over time plus a smaller size than normal might restrict some movement

The xl should be fine as long as you are looking for the shirt to be skin tight.
Good quality lycra
I'm 6' 170 with a very toned athletic physique. Sounds like your thin yourself. I bought a medium. It is designed to hug your body and be 'form' fitting. With that said the length is great and doesn't ride up so I wear mine with or without a jersey over the top. It looks great on either way. I'd recommend the medium for you. Hope this helps.
It should work for that just fine as long as you wear something over it like a t-shirt, otherwise it will keep you cool wherever it's exposed to air
I'm actually the same size (though you have a bit lower BF percentage) and I have found the XL to be comfortably snug for workouts. If you want to play it safe, go for the 2XL, but I wouldn't go higher than that. My XL extends about 8" below my waist, so length should be ok for you.
Well It depends if you like the shirt to fit tight or loose. I like them to fit loosely & I ordered a 2x & it fit me tight like a glove.
M
I might go with the XXL. It should still have the compression feel and will be easier to get out of after a work out.
If he can fit a small I recommend it
Husband tucks in everytime.

I'm actually the same size (though you have a bit lower BF percentage) and I have found the XL to be comfortably snug for workouts. If you want to play it safe, go for the 2XL, but I wouldn't go higher than that. My XL extends about 8" below my waist, so length should be ok for you.
Well It depends if you like the shirt to fit tight or loose. I like them to fit loosely & I ordered a 2x & it fit me tight like a glove.
M
I might go with the XXL. It should still have the compression feel and will be easier to get out of after a work out.
If he can fit a small I recommend it
Husband tucks in everytime.
The xl should be fine as long as you are looking for the shirt to be skin tight.
Good quality lycra
I'm 6' 170 with a very toned athletic physique. Sounds like your thin yourself. I bought a medium. It is designed to hug your body and be 'form' fitting.

You should be a SMALL... This is UA's MEN'S TOPS SIZE CHART - Chest (inches) SM = 34-36, MD = 38-40, LG = 42-44, XL = 46-48, & XXL = 50-52
If I have it tucked in as an undershirt no not at all but untucked it rides up but I got a slight beer gut my friend who is smaller has no issue
Depends on how you want it to fit its a compression shirt i personally use it for working out If you want loose fit go one size up from what you wear.
I have a fairly large chest, pant size 36. I buy large and it's pretty snug but that's how I want this kind of shirt to be. Going off of the pants size I'd assume he's a little bigger than I am so I wouldn't go any less than XL. (If he wants it snug) I'd also suggest maybe going to a sporting goods store and trying them on then buying from Amazon.
I am 6'6" 215 44 inch chest. I ordered a XL and the length is great. A couple inches longer than regular tank t-s. I have a longer torso too
hi - my hubby has only worn the under armour so I am unable to help you. sorry!
It might. It should adapt to your hips by the shape. I would recommend a medium if your bust size is 32 or larger. These are tight fitting, yet comfortable
Well I have the medium shirt but I would recommend to try to get your proper size since the shirt tends to rise over time plus a smaller size than normal might restrict some movement
It's more compression in that it's snug fitting (to show off that Under Armour body!) It is not compression like compression shorts or cycling shorts. I wouldn't be surprised if UA offers a line of apparel like what you're looking for, but the Heatgear line probably won't do what you're wanting.
These are to wear under a bullet proof vest to keep you dry or for working out
The xl should be fine as long as you are looking for the shirt to be skin tight.

No, it is fixed (sewn) at the bottom and top.
Yes, not padded at all, but a zip pocket on the inner side. Unable to retrieve weapon while wearing it but large enough for a subcompact. Maybe fullsize
Not exactly. Rambler - Width: 8.5 Mac 15 - Depth: 9.73 And even sadder if the laptop in its own carrying case.
I don't know the exact size. The pouch on the back is the same height and width of the bag itself.
No
Not that I'm aware of, left shoulder only
Yeah it holds a 15 laptop. 17 inch laptop is very tight fit
Per the Red Rock website: Measures: 8.5"W x 7"D x 17"H http://redrockoutdoorgear.com/rambler-sling-backpack
Get the bigger version. This one is too small for books but the full size is perfect. I use it as a briefcase and computer case often.
I've put a small lap top and 2 days worth of clothes in mine. Not sure what size the camera and lenses are. Dimensions of bag should be listed in Amazon discription
May be a tight fit on the width. As described on the manufacturer's website, Measures: 8.5"W x 7"D x 17"H
Dark olive drab. Very nice.
Yes, there's a large zippered sleeve next to the back pad that would hold just about any pistol. Keep in mind its right next to the back pad though so comfort may be an issue if you're carrying a 454 casull.
Across chest from left shoulder to right hip. You can certainly carry it on your right shoulder but not as a sling.
618 cu in. About 10-11 liters.
Its practically right next to the width for my HP14 Chromebook, should come to 15.6" , but I suspect that 17 " is too big .
Yes if you look near the top of the strap on the bag their is a small hole for the hose. This will help you find the hard to find water placement
Yes about even with each hip, there is about 6" of very slightly elastic...it only gives a small amount of "flex" They come with an adjustable belt. The shorts run true to size and are my best summer shorts, I've got 4 pair and they're great.
Home Run for you. They have a zippered fly with button at waist, easy zipper. There is no mesh liner in the front or back of the shorts, only behind the pockets.
I believe you have inseam options of 10" or 12". I got the 12's and they hit about the middle of my kneecap. Hope this helps.
Not sure I know what you mean by that...but there is a pocket on either side and in the rear and a zipper pocket on the left leg...my husband loves them...so comfortable...
Yes - Part. On each side there is a ~6 inch section of elastic. Just enough to flex a bit.
yes. I wear them to work with a regular leather belt
10" or 12" inseam. I buy the 12's and they hit right at top of knee cap
What is your measurement from wrist to armpit and I'll measure mine..I'm 5'9"
Traditional Buttons, not snaps
Runs pretty true to size, nice shirt I like mine...
I don't know. Maybe one is SPF and the other is SPF and insect repellent but I really am not sure.
just below hip. i wear out and/or in

These pants are extremely comfortable, nicer than the "average" travel cargo pants. They don't wrinkle and can be used for more dressy occasions while traveling. Thumbs up!!
They do come in a 30" inseam (that's what I bought). Of course they can be altered like regular pants. They are the best pants I've ever bought.
Yes, the side thigh pocket is zippered.
Mid-rise I believe. TErminology might be different. I think of them as having a bit of a low waist. Fit a little below waist. Very comfortable for me.

Ya a little wrinkly. I really like the shirt regardless
I am in between 1x + 2x . But TALL is a better fit. They have a size chart @ Amazon. I took a chance + they fit the best I have ever tried on. But saying that I think they have a liberal return policy. I can't advise you at those sizes. But the shirt I think will work out great for me. The sun block is a must....Sorry I couldn't be any help except for the size chart.
The care instruction tag in the bottom hem OF MINE says "100% polyester"

Size M is 31" neckline to bottom of jacket at the back.
The Columbia Women's Splash a Little Jacket is thin, comfortable, and stylish. However, you will need a medium size purse (not very small) to fully accommodate it. Living in Houston, TX, wear this jacket almost constantly. If you decide to buy it, you should be happy.
unzipped? Unzipped?, no, the delivered good. The product is very good and the time to delivered were on time. Thanks

Yes... but you could always spray it with water repellent.
No hood. And not stiff at all, the material is super soft and pliable. Light to moderate material rub noise, but nothing unbearable or obnoxious.
Yes, it has a thin lining.
I found it to be a tight fit, so I wouldn't be able to put extra clothes underneath. It was a good wind breaker, so it would depend on your jacket.
chest measurement is 38"
The jacket has a 100% polyester lining; the silver dotted insulating kind, so it does slide on easily. It is fitted. I am a large and, over bulky sweaters, the XL is snug.
I don't know if it actually runs small but it is a snug fit. I usually go for a looser style.

Yes, it has a thin lining.
I found it to be a tight fit, so I wouldn't be able to put extra clothes underneath. It was a good wind breaker, so it would depend on your jacket.
chest measurement is 38"
The jacket has a 100% polyester lining; the silver dotted insulating kind, so it does slide on easily. It is fitted. I am a large and, over bulky sweaters, the XL is snug.
I don't know if it actually runs small but it is a snug fit. I usually go for a looser style.

None. Three Velcro pockets only. It is not a pair pants for travel. It is designed for out door uses. It would look awfully if one wears in urban area.
I, unfortunately wear a 36, so I ordered an XL the first time as I was afraid the large would be too small. As it was I ended up sending the XL back and getting the L which fit perfectly. If you wear a 33 I would order the Medium.
I would suggest Small. Pretty close to sizing with my medium
Fly front zipper.
For 42, I did xxl and I had a very comfortable/loose fit. For length, you have specific length options.

Hi Peter, Can't answer that for you. Myself, I am a 33 waist by 34 Long. My order was Medium in waist and 34 Long. I believe their is enough waist play after me wearing mine with the elastic waist band to help give you the comfort you need. These are my second pair and I really like them for comfort and hiking.
They have 32, but if you prefer a " looser" fit, my friend, I would suggest you get the next size up. I do, I personally hate tight clothing. Hope I help, good luck!
Hi Aleem. I suggest you order the XLarge/32-inch. I ordered the Medium/32-inch which fit very well for me and I am a size 33" waist and 31 inseam. The waist fit for me is snug and the little extra inseam length falls to just the right height on my hiking boots. Hope that helps.
I wear 40/42 and the XL fit me fine. If I were in your shoes I'd purchase the XXL 30inseam

No. It does not. I would also like to ad that this is NOT a fully waterproof coat. It is good for a light rian for about 30 minutes but NOTHING more. If you are looking for something that will keep you completely dry. This is not it.
No lining and I have no idea about any warranty..

Yes, this jacket is awesome as an everyday Autumn jacket to me, not just in the rain. It is an awesome rain jacket as well. One of the best purchases in jackets I have ever made, and I am in no way exaggerating

No. It does not. I would also like to ad that this is NOT a fully waterproof coat. It is good for a light rian for about 30 minutes but NOTHING more. If you are looking for something that will keep you completely dry. This is not it.
No lining and I have no idea about any warranty..
both.........
Yes, this jacket is awesome as an everyday Autumn jacket to me, not just in the rain. It is an awesome rain jacket as well. One of the best purchases in jackets I have ever made, and I am in no way exaggerating

Hello Mrs. Barker-Ross For UA, usually Amazon carries the size chart next to the sizes, but it seems this is not the case this time. Feel free to visit UA's size chart page, and refer to the Women's Bottoms section. Here is the link: http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/size-charts#womens-bottoms I am afraid I am not sure how much a 10-12 size is, to be honest, but if you follow the chart, it will all go alright!
Mine are not extremely tight, but the bottom seam has not bothered me at all. You don't really notice it.
There is no rubbery band on the interior of the legs. However, I bought these because all (and I mean ALL) the women in my running group swear by them. I now know why--there is absolutely, positively, certainly not a tiny iota of a chance that these will ride up. They're great. Buy two.
My wife says they do not, but she also says they are comfortable enough not to matter
No
I suppose you could. I do not.

It's a pretty decend size for men's watches. my grandsons and hubby are well pleased.
The size if the slots are rather large. There is a pillow type component in each slot that can be removed if needed. I bought this for my boyfriend and he likes the more large face watches and they seems to fit just fine with the pillow. I was worried when I read the reviews that it wouldn't close but that is not the case. I hope this amswers your question
The inside is cushy velvet. Real velvet? I don't know, not a velvet connoisseur but it's not cheap or plastic. Outside is suede.
Yes all of the pillows can be removed from the box
I actually bought this for my wife and she loves it.
1.75 inches x 3.5 inches
I am sorry, I don't know! My daughter's suction cups did come off and we just super glued them back on without any problems since. She has not bent or broken her arrows (yet ;) ). My youngest daughter wanted a similar toy for her birthday and she ended up picking out a bow and arrow from the Nerf Rebel line of girls toys and this has held up much better.
No it is plastic. My 3 year old granddaughter think its great but it is cheaply made and the string stretched out quickly
Assuming they haven't changed the design, the one we have can be enlarged to a maximum of 50 inches.
if its within united states shipping would be 5.49 outside united states between $20-$45
It was made in China.
Yes and they suction to windows. They are not harmful, but they are very fun! It's an accurate shot too!
They are fairly robust for plastic toys. The arrows are flexible and the bow has a reinforced shell, so it looks like it will take some bending. The attachment points for the bow string are relatively weak, but if they fail it should be easy enough to attach them to the bow itself. The actual string is pretty inferior. It's not bad, but it's the one fail point in an otherwise good design. Still, replacing the string with something a little less prone to stretching should be easy enough. The quiver strap has a lot of play, but 5 foot 6 is a bit large for it, I think. It will probably fit, but it will be a bit tight.
No, it is plastic, but has held up well for us. There are several different Merida bows and this one is the highest quality I have seen.
I have just re-examined the bow and quiver, and I would definitely say that it is NOT girl nor boy biased! The bow is "carved" with Celtic knot - type designs, which are simply - "Celtic", and very gender Neutral. Be aware, however that the cardboard case that the set arrives in, does have pictures of Merida on it. It's a shame that we have to even worry about such things, isn't it? I'm a very feminine almost-a-grandmother - When I was small, about 5, I wanted cowboy guns and a holster, and I loved playing with toy trains! I didn't care about "labels", I just wanted to PLAY! The playing was The Point, not whether it was labeled, this or that! By the way, I still HAVE toy trains, and enjoy them with my toy-train-loving husband! - Back to the point, the set Itself is very gender-neutral, with Merida on the packaging.
This toy does not have Merida's picture on it. I think it would be suitable for a boy because it is tan and brown with a tribal design on the bow. My daughter still loves and plays with this toy a lot. The only drawback that I have is the suction cups came loose from the arrows, but we super-glued them back on and they have been fine ever since. Hope this helps! &#128516;
my diesel watches hang over a bit. Anything with a 50m diameter will hang over the edge, and you kind of "push" the lid closed, but it works.
I would say it holds medium size watches, but if it's too large I don't think it will hold it well.
Yes
Plastic, but very hard nice plastic
Yes it should be able to. The cusions weren't very big
It should. I have an Invicta watch which is big and it holds it. I also have a iron man watch which is a velcro band watch and it holds it. I hope this helps
Yes, the entire inside is removable. A single or multiple dividers could be taken out and then the inside could be put back in.
it opens only the way its pictured.
Yes
Yes it does I have 5 very large invictas and another medium and all fit very well . this is a great box well made you will be very pleased when it arrives . I am a watch collector and the glass top makes daily selection very easy . best wishes .
Hi, the dividers are fixed & the length is 17". My husband just measured his :-)...
Yes, it does. My husband loves this watch box.
Yes, I have several watches that are big face watches and the case holds them with no problem.
Dear Customer, Thanks for your interest in our products unfortunately we do not ship to Canada at this time Best regards Monica B
I'm 5'10'' 42 chest avg build and the med/reg fits perfectly. The large will prob give you a little more arm length and body room.
I would say a large

I'm sorry - that item was a Christmas gift, and I honestly do not remember what it looked like!

For me, they kinda go at the waist and i can also pull them higher... I bought a medium and its not snug on me so when I run, they kinda slip down even when i pull them high above my waist. But that could be because I bought a size larger than required. They still don't rub or cut into my skin. Hope that answers your question.
I, too, sweat a lot...these are great
Yes
I think so.

I wear it maybe 3 times a week and wind it almost every morning. I haven't dropped it on a hard surface yet, but have dropped it several times on the carpet from 3-4 feet and no problems.
Wind: twist the crown (the thing that goes around the base of the button, above where the ring attaches) clockwise until you feel more resistance than usual, no more than that. Set time: pull on crown (at first it will feel like you might break it, but keep pulling till you hear a click and it comes out a bit) and turn either way. :D
Yup there's a glass panel
About the same as a silver dollar
Pull gently on the crown on the knob, but don't prod.
These shoes not wide width, nor were they offered as such.
I ordered my normal shoe size, 6.5 medium width, they fit perfectly.
Either. They are entry level shoes for the casual bowler & not designed specifically for right or left dominance.
Yes! They fit extremely well and are very comfortable. I am so pleased with them!
No but I only have owned for 6 months. Dexter is known for bring a good product. If you left in the car or hot climate that may be your problem.

I think so. and I never practiced this sport, but the pants in general is comfortable and lightweight. As upper layer was very useful
I bought the XL and I'm a size 34-34. I'd say if you are 38" waist or above to get the XXL.
standard size front pockets like you would find on a pair jeans, and again these are not pants, they are rain paints
both front pockets have zippers, yes. The single back pocket is velcro.
Interesting question, I have no way to actually weigh them, but they are very light weight, less than a pound, maybe less than 1/2 a pound.
Yes, they do.
if you are going to wear shorts under are recommended to ask is one size

Not sure of the size, but I'd say very small. I wear a size 7 and they tore at the seams after wearing them twice. I'd say they are poorly made.
Hey, I would recommend non marking sole tekkies. The carpet gliders is not recommended for concrete.
I cannot say how effective they are on wood floors. I only used them on carpeted floors.
These are a "one size fits all" kind of thing. The bottom half has a lot of elastic in it to make sure it fits your shoe snugly. I wear an 8- 8 1/2, and they could definitely fit another 2 sizes up or down.
Size 10 in women
The package that I purchased was a Medium and Shoe Size listed is WMN 7.5-9.5. I wear a 9-9.5 shoe and they fit me well.
No, these socks are not itchy. They are made of a fine gauge Merino wool along with fine gauge knitting. They also have a high stitch count so they are soft and not bulky at all.
They seem to fit snug and firm all the way up there doesn't seem to be any elastic at the top. I have large calfs and they do not bind or fall down. They are wonderful and warm.
Yes
I don't think so, but my feet are long and narrow and the toe part is a bit wide for me. You should be fine, try them they're great when you have the right size (I tried medium and decided they duck but then bought large and love them, got all the colors and some of the men's ones) And the price is for one pair. But they have a lifetime warranty =D Try a pair
Hiked in Utah when temp was around 80...my feet did not sweat. Love these socks! Took quite a long hike: no blisters!!!
67% Merino Wool, 29% Nylon, 4% Lycra Spandex please see http://darntough.com/stripe-micro-crew-cushion
I sent small to each of my four daughters, they wear size seven show, I am a six and a half size shoe and wear small. Hope this helps. I have a friend who is a size nine shoe and she wears a large. Medium is great if you have size six and seven and want to wear pairs of socks.
I'm a size 8.5 / 9, and they fit me well.
I purchased the sock size that fit my shoe size (which was a medium). I have a 15 inch calf and the socks fit quite comfortably. I have problems with fitting socks over my calves. Not so with these.
Sizes recommend from Darn tough site. Mens Womens Euro UK - S 4.5-7 35-37/38 2.5-5 S 5.5-7.5 M 7.5-9.5 38-40/41 5-7 M 8-9.5 L 10-11.5 41-42/43 7.5-9 L 10-12 - 43-45 9.5-11.5 XL 12.5+ - 46+ 12+ Kids S 9-11.5 M 12-2.5 L 3-6
No I would not describe them as such. They are basically a heavy hiking sock. They are great for warmth.
Small fits a size 7 with room to spare, so it should work. You may want to inquire on the Darn Tough website.
There was a lack of shoe/sock chart on the Amazon site but I went to the Darn Tough website where I found a chart. To be certain what size to order, due to other reviews mentioning fit, I contacted Darn Tough and they verified the size I should order.
These are softer than smart wool and more fitted. They have a lifetime warranty against holes. I have been wearing my original pair for 3 months now and they still look and feel like the first day I put them on. There are different styles also. Light are thinner and less cushioned. They do what they say.
Medium socks fit shoe sizes 7.5 to 9.5 I love these socks!!
one pair
My ankles tend to swell and when I take my socks off there is usually an indentation, with these the was none. HOPE THAT HELPS.
I am not a runner but can tell you that these socks are very for fitted. They do not slide down into the shoe. They make thinner versions for specific activities. But if you are running in cold weather these would serve well.
Women's sizes . Wonderful socks!!!
I'm a size 8-8.5 and the mediums are a good fit. Not much extra room though so I would probably go for a large.
No not bulky at all. Just a helpful cushion. These are the best socks I've ever found anywhere.
http://darntough.com/women/womens-hike-trek/solid-micro-crew-cushion
I think they run small. I wear a 7.5 women's shoe and these fit very well, just a bit snug at the top. If I wore a size larger shoe I would definitely go to the next size sock!

I sent small to each of my four daughters, they wear size seven show, I am a six and a half size shoe and wear small. Hope this helps. I have a friend who is a size nine shoe and she wears a large. Medium is great if you have size six and seven and want to wear pairs of socks.
I'm a size 8.5 / 9, and they fit me well.
While this unit is in fact adequately deep (approx 7") and wide, I would very strongly reccommend against purchasing this model. I purchased mine new in February 2013 and in August the button to adjust the time stopped working. The following month the unit would no longer turn on, rendering it useless. I have since purchased a Branson 2210 which I have been very pleased with.
Yes but it will stop working after about 5 hrs
Anytime this unit is on, the heater runs. So, if so, I haven't figured out how. But for my purpose I need the heater.
It probably can. I use it with water and detergent. I've had to replace the front control panel twice, however the company sent the new control panels at no cost. Not the best quality machine, but cheap.
Mine is still good, and I use it frequently.
I use mine often and for long periods and have never had on problem.
No, but as the unit is small and light and therefore very easy to carry to a sink and pour out of, I've never found the lack of a drain to be an issue at all. If anything it just avoids potential problem.
6.1/2w 10"long 10"high great machine.
It has a typical CYA warranty and to be honest, I do not know how well they stand behind it. So far the units we have installed are performing flawlessly, but other than that I cannot say.
I don't believe that they come with a drain at all. The one I have I just tip it to empty it and I don't have a drain either.
Oh purchased this for my 3 yr old an 5 yr old there extremely fitted very tight stretchy normaly my 3 yr old could never wear an xs but in this he does no joke an got my 5 yr old a Sm & Med besides being a ting bit long witch is ok med fit great an he's average height & weight he will be 6 soon so good luck hope this helps
Our G'son is just recently 6 and is is 48 lbs. The shirt is little bit long & they fit on the tight side. We like the Medium.
Shirt runs true to size, fits snug not real loose and baggy. We wanted it for a male dancer to show the muscle definition for his teachers to verify the moves are correct and they work well for that purpose. Also would be good for athletic activities.
i think its suitable for 13 years old average boy

Children. I ordered a size small for my 6 year old daughter. It fits her very well.
I dont know
Under Armour always runs small and a bit tight. Also the material tends to cling and static. I love the shirt and the colors, great compromise for my tomboy daughter. So depending what your girl wears now, go a bit larger.
Depends on how big she is. Probably XS or S. Got an XS for my slightly taller than average but slim 5 year old and she will probably be able to wear a couple years as it is long on her. You can look at size chart on UA website.
Youth large
My daughter is ten and built very small so i got her a youth medium and it is a little big for her but she will grow into it... This is also the second year of her wearing it.... Hold up very well and still looks new...
Yes - we just did a small 11 year old girl - but she is only 72 # - and it bit her and shrunk a bit. Instructions are to dry cold and hang dry, so we did that and it went well - but it was not a big size at all - it just fit her. She is about 4'7. Thin is OK - my daughter is rail thin. If yours is very small, maybe go one size lower.
I would go with the xl.
A girls probably won't fit her, even if you bought the xl.
They are true sizes. I wear a 6 and the size 6 fits perfectly
I dont know they we for may daughter. she says she loves them
It evens out. The pink shoes are cheaper but charge shipping.
I don't see why not. I'm right handed, but the shoes appear to be built equally and have the same slide toe/bottom on both shoes.

My son wears a size 7 1/2 in men's. They fit him well
These are Men's and don't know if they come in the size equivalent to women's which would be a 6-6.5, to find the women's equivalent to men's just subtract 1.5 to 2 sizes depending on the brand. The only other problem would be the width, Men's being a D and Women's being a B for normal widths.
No. But it is a very comfortable shoe.
Both--there is a Slide-Rite patch on both shoes.

I don't think it would Jennifer, plus my daughter finds it a bit heavy to wear.. though she loves the style.
I'm 8-10 as well and I have a large. While it sometimes feels a little big, I like that it is roomy enough to be comfortable if I have layers on underneath. I tried on both sizes NOT of this coat but of a similar style by the same maker. The medium was a bit small, and tight under the arms.
I don't know the temp in Germany in the winter.....however, my daughter wore it this past winter on a very snowy, cold college campus in Pennsylvania at she was warm. Temps in PA were below 20f many days.
The overall size of the coat is a large. I have a size C breast and I can close the coat with no problem...even with a fleece jacket.

I bought a size medium for my daughter last month. She is 5'4 and 135, very fit. It was loose fitting should have ordered a small. Hope that helps.
The white shows through some if you wear it fitted. Not with a looser fit. The darker colors don't show through at all.
No, it's for hot weather. The slightest breeze cools you off when you have it on.
Hi Karen, it may be. The sleeves of the shirt, from shoulder to wrist, is about 23 inches. I am 5 foot 4 and my arm length, shoulder to wrist, is about 22 inches long. The end of the sleeves reached about the base of my thumb. I hope this helped!
I bought it for my daughter she is about 100 lbs and 5'2 1/2" and I ordered her a small and she likes the fit not too snug but not super loose either. Hope that helps!
Yes, i got this for my daughter. It is very light and silky. It would be fine for summer- if you want to wear long sleeves.
no, not this particular one..
never had the coldgear, but the heatgear shirt I ordered fit true to size!!

It's a cotton/poly t-shirt, not the heatgear material, sizing is true for t-shirts.

The XXL on me runs a little short (like most UA attire). It's very tight on the arms. I would have gone with the XXXL if it was available. But I love the shirt and love the cause it supports. I am not tall, 5'10, but I weight 280 and have an "bodybuilder" build...
This is their chart from under armour's website: Chest (in) Waist (in) SM 34-36 28-29 MD 38-40 30-32 LG 42-44 34-36 XL 46-48 38-40 XXL 50-52 42-44 3XL 52-54 44-46 4XL 54-56 46-48 5XL 56-58 48-50
This is a loose fit shirt. The charged cotton shirts fit like a regular t-shirt.
These are Under Armour T shirts. The shirt does not actually say what the material is other than "Heat Gear".., normal UA gear.., so I would guess no to the 100% cotton.

I bought a size medium for my daughter last month. She is 5'4 and 135, very fit. It was loose fitting should have ordered a small. Hope that helps.

Hi Karen, it may be. The sleeves of the shirt, from shoulder to wrist, is about 23 inches. I am 5 foot 4 and my arm length, shoulder to wrist, is about 22 inches long. The end of the sleeves reached about the base of my thumb. I hope this helped!
I bought it for my daughter she is about 100 lbs and 5'2 1/2" and I ordered her a small and she likes the fit not too snug but not super loose either. Hope that helps!
Yes, i got this for my daughter. It is very light and silky. It would be fine for summer- if you want to wear long sleeves.

Here's a little more info to help you make a decision. My husband is the same sleeve but a 15, sometimes 15 1/2 in the neck. I ordered him a medium in the short sleeve style for Christmas and it was really big. It was so big I almost returned it but since I picked it up cheap on a Lightning Deal I decided to keep it and trying washing it. It's polyester though, so it didn't really help. These shirts are standard wear in our neck of the woods (or should I say water?) ;-). They are not meant to be fitted but they shouldn't be too billowy either. The medium on my husband (who could stand to loose a few) definitely bordered on too billowy. They are very(very) wide and run big through the shoulders. The shoulder seam actually came down about and inch or two into his upper arm. For what its worth, I am going to try a small this time around and hope for a better fit.
I believe they are. The front left pocket is at least 6 inches deep and 5 inches wide. I have an iPhone 6 that I fit in one and my wallet in the other side and there is plenty of room left!
The sleeves can be rolled up and secured with a button tab.
Tough question. Think a small might be to short.
I bought "vivid Blue" and it is true to color. Awesome shirt. Very light and comfortable!
A size Small fits neck 15-15.5, sleeves 33, and chest 35-38.
I don't know what to say but will tell you that I'm 6' usually wear a 16 1/2 by34. I bought a large and it was to big. If I had to do it again, would get a medium. Hope that helps.
No
I'm 5ft9in and weight 190 lbs and large fits fine for me. XL should do it. It may be long, but it's such a nice shirt, that shouldn't matter. Buy just one and see. I now have five and wear them almost every day! My wife gets credit for the answer, but it's really mine.
I think the size L maybe large for you. your shoulder and chest is like me. but the shirt is too long and the chest is too big

Dear Sir, Thank you for writing. After placing your order for your name tapes, there should be a prompt to send us an email, or find our contact information on our name tape page, as to what you would like on those tapes. Information cannot be split on a set of name tapes. If you want three with your first name and three with your last name, you can order two sets of 3 name tapes. Regards, Linda G. U.S. Cavalry
No. They only accept one name in each set of 6. However, US cavalry seems to have good customer service, so you might want to drop them an email to see if they can put different names on the tapes.

It didn't weigh much but I only had it on for about 30 minutes when I was trying to get the zipper to work.I never did and sent it back.Maybe you'll have better luck but the zipper looked awfully flimsy to me. That's a shame because the rest of the jacket was just what I was looking for.
Not sure what the actual temp for this coat is but I wear it to our dog park where I basically stand around and watch my dogs run and it keeps me very warm with a tshirt and sweatshirt under it.We go every day all winter long
medium to maybe large. i'm a 44 and take large
just below the waist
No inside pockets, has plenty of storage for me on the outside. Did some ice fishing this year in Michigan and was as warm as promised. For the price its a good buy.
probably large

Not sure what the actual temp for this coat is but I wear it to our dog park where I basically stand around and watch my dogs run and it keeps me very warm with a tshirt and sweatshirt under it.We go every day all winter long
medium to maybe large. i'm a 44 and take large
just below the waist
No inside pockets, has plenty of storage for me on the outside. Did some ice fishing this year in Michigan and was as warm as promised. For the price its a good buy.
probably large
I checked with my husband and he ordered an XLG he is about a 38 waist, he said he thinks you would be fine with XLG . He said they are a little loose on him. Hope this helps but I know you will love them.
The XL will fit in the waist. They run a little long in the length.. About 32.
Yes they do
I have xxl and have a 36 waist.
Xxl
Order a large. My spouse is a 38/30 and they fit perfectly! I am so impressed with the quality of these jeans that I will never stop bragging on them!
I would say large should be ok but everyone is different so it's really your call. I'm a 32 and they fit great on me.
The two pair I got were not hemmed I cut off about 4 inches for my boys who were 32 34 inch inseams They should work for you I hope my boys won't buy anything but Yukon brand
Probably a Medium. My husband got the XL and has a 36 waist and he could have actually went with the large.
Label say 100% cotton and feel like they are. I'll know for sure after the first wash by how wrinkled they are. They have a very nice feel, soft like 100% cotton, and light weight without being flimsy. Very well constructed.

No, I tkink it is man made but the stitching is very good.
No, I'm afraid not.

The color is more like the picture with the tag on the purse
I ordered the medium (7.5-9) and was wearing a Saucony Xodus 3.0 trail shoe in size 9. They were the perfect size gaitors.
I saw a size guide on REI.com that put 7.5 near the upper end of small, so I'd go with that size.
I wear a 9 1/2 shoe and the Med. is perfect.
They will help keep moisture out but there is not a water tight seal between the shoe and gaitor. If you stay in standing water, you will get wet. Running through wet grass, brush or even puddles, it will help keep the water out.
These are unisex. I wear 9.5/10 women's (aprox. 9 men's) and use M. My husband wears size 13 and uses L.
Large
I wear a men's 8.5 trail shoe ( I have wide feet. Roughly women's 10-10.5) so I ordered a Medium and they fit perfectly.
price is for the pair
Probably not. They are designed for a running shoe. I purchased them with my Salomon winter runners (as shown). The rubber fits under and it's pretty snug to fit around the shoe. It works great for these shoes even in deep snow!
Hi, the correct size is M. I'm 10 and I bought size L, I made a mistake. I sold them and bought others size M. Works very good.

Can't say for sure, but I am 5'5" and 200lbs with a 46" chest. I have both a large and an extra large shirt. I can get into both. The short sleeved model is a large and is actually easier on and off than the long sleeved extra large.
Im also a 42, i got the large and its still pretty tight. Keep in mind this shirt doesnt do much for keeping your back aligned, although it is good quality material.
I recommend getting a large - I'm 5' 11" about 175 and I wear a large, it's tight but you want that. I do recommend getting the one without sleeves, it's much more comfortable and a V neck. I actually have 3 of them. And, the return policies are pretty easy, so if you don't like the size you get you can always return. Maybe think about getting a large and a medium, try them both out, return the one you don't like. Hope that helps
I don't think so. It has many features and seems to be of quality construction. I would contact them direct and ask.
it's like any lycra shirt. It has very little heat retention.
I'd go with a medium.
Yes, you could. It isn't as hot as I thought it would be. It is tighter than most t-shirts and I had get used to wearing it. You may have to wear it for a few short periods before trying to wear it all day.
The sleeveless model is crew, the short sleeve is vee
I'd go with a L. I'm 6'2" 195, and I wear a L. It has a really long trunk, so you could be 6'6" and wear an L, as long as you aren't too wide.

For spinning, I look for a WELL VENTILATED, easy to walk in shoe with decent support in the sole. Comparatively speaking, this shoe should serve you quite well. It is also compatible with SPD pedals/clips.
44, but I'd recommend a 45. I had to size up for a little more extra room.
Yes.
It depends in your pedals. The cleats that come with these shoes are the standard 2 bolt SPD cleats. Many trainers use this type.
Not sure Cherri. Go to zappos.com. They have a shoe size conversion chart. You will compare usa to European. Hope that helps Jeff
Go to zappos.com. Euro size 47 is equivalent to us 14
Great... I love them!
Our size 12 is European size 46. I do not know if they express widths the same as we. I would try to get a size 46 wide or maybe 46E, etc.
I totally agree on the confusion. I think the problem stems from how people prefer their shoes to fit and that everyone's feet are a bit different. I wear a 10 in Nike running shoes and the Shimano 44 is ideal for me.
After about 1year and 1300 miles they have been great. They are good to walk around when you are not on the bike I have shimano combo pedals spd on one side and regular on the other I think they are A530 or similar.

For spinning, I look for a WELL VENTILATED, easy to walk in shoe with decent support in the sole. Comparatively speaking, this shoe should serve you quite well. It is also compatible with SPD pedals/clips.
44, but I'd recommend a 45. I had to size up for a little more extra room.
Yes.
It depends in your pedals. The cleats that come with these shoes are the standard 2 bolt SPD cleats. Many trainers use this type.
Not sure Cherri. Go to zappos.com. They have a shoe size conversion chart. You will compare usa to European. Hope that helps Jeff
Go to zappos.com. Euro size 47 is equivalent to us 14
Great... I love them!
Our size 12 is European size 46. I do not know if they express widths the same as we. I would try to get a size 46 wide or maybe 46E, etc.

Yes, this sock is listed as Small/Medium and will fit Men's Shoe size 4-9 or Women's shoe size 5-10. I am a female and wear a shoe size of 8.5 and these socks fit perfectly.

In my experience and the bowling alley I go to the they have and even slide to grip ratio although I have not treated the bottoms in a while, also if u decide to go with this shoe keep in mind that they run a bit big so maybe get half a size smaller. Hope this helps.
No, medium
As long as you never plan on using them for bowling. You would ruin the glide pads on the sole.
No, it only goes part way to the heel. But there's sliding soles on both shoes.
Yes they will. The bottoms are matching.

It's big enough enough for 3 medium sized textbook, along with a mini computer, an one inch binder and 2 notebooks all together. It may look small, but it sure can fit!
not every seller ship internationally.
You mean if the back of the bookbag is padded? I guess so? It's not too thick. It's comfortable for me. Very. But that's because I don't try to carry a body worth of weight in there. So if you do that, Idk if this is a bag for you.
Yes
Yes
No it doesn't but it still ha a ton of room. I usually just clip my bottle to the handle on the top. :)
Yes it is. It is a great backpack. I am happy with this product.
I believe so but im not sure how long. It was in the label but i threw it already. Sorry, not much help here.
It depends on the bars of the walker in question.
The small size may make it difficult to fit on a rear rack. The piece of material that connects the two "saddle bags" is only about an 1.5 - 2 inches wide. It fits great fastened to the stem of the handlebars and cross bar. I love this bag for carrying my keys, money, phone, ID and other small items. I have bags for the back of my bike for touring and hauling my clothes back and forth to work. This little bag is great for the rides that you only need the necessities. I ride a road bike and do not have any problems with this bag being in my way.
Hey, Daniel, sorry we can not ship to Mexico, We can only ship to USA
only with the side pockets the main mesh its tight squeeze but possible. but too tight for easy access. it held supplies for a 105 mile bike ride no problem nuk tablets power bars and tools with a patch kit. over all not a bad forward bag and for the price it is worth it.
Mt cell with its cover are 3 inches, the tube bag is not enough to keep it :(
I have the droid x and if I really squeeze it fits. Really tight fit. Not sure dimensions of iphone5.
They are(always) one or two size's short. I'm large so I got X-L or XX-L. I hope this helps. You can check the chart in E-bay.
I (33 waist 6'3) actually have a large pair and they fit well without tying the string, even after months of regular use. Medium should be fine unless you want them to be noticeably tight.
Hi there Joseph they got nothing to do or have any similarity with boxing trunks. They are tight for obvious reasons they are made for kick boxing(muay thai) So they are short very short, I have to use compressor shorts. I am large so I ordered XL OR XXL. I hope this help you.
Hello Romuria I recommend going with personally I wear a lot bigger size Muay Thai shorts than expected even though I am a 32 .so xl or bigger mine are a little tight even w/xl .hope this helps
i wear a 33 and the medium fits me pretty tight. i would order a medium for a 32 and a small for 30.

Six (6) pair.
My husband is a size 11 and he wears large. Hope this helps!
6 pair in a pack
Not a lot of lint as far as I can tell. These socks are very well made and super comfortable
If I remember correctly I ordered the medium. I have extremely small feet, size 7 1/2, and the medium fits me perfect. I hope that gives you and indication of the sizing.
Medium.
Well, I ordered the large and they fit PERFECTLY. I am a size 10, men's.

They are a nylon and yes they hook on fingers and back like the picture! They are very cute and seem to be holding up well to an active 4 yearold!
I dont think its thread that is glittered, its a ring around the circles, very small amt, and very secured. Lol...love this question. I hate glitter too! You are safe with these.
My daughter is a size 6... They fit! &#128512;
Soft & moveable
It's held on by arm bands near shoulder and finger loops. From finger loop to finger loop it is 36 ". From wing tip to tip 42". From top to bottom 21".
It has 2 stretchy loops that they put their arms through.
I suspect they will be too small, but think you could easily add elastic to the finger loops to create wrist loops that would allow her to wear these comfortably.
Unfortunately, I purchased them as a gift for an 8 yr. old. Only saw them briefly. Might work, but they will not look big on an adult. Sorry I don't have a better answer
Yes, they're just fabric-no wires or anything to keep them rigid. The wing tips have little loops for the kids to put their thumb through. So when they flap their arms, the wings move.
Its 20" x 44". It's just slightly big on my almost 3 year old.
2 elastic straps that the sit thier arms through and the rest on their shoulders and there are little loops on the end to stick on a finger like a ring. The girls love these and can put them on themselves (ages 3 and 5)
Arm and thumb straps
Yes, is very noticible. The color really shines ay night and even more at sunlight.
I was very happy with the quality and look of this. My daughter has been wearing this often, since receiving it in April. She is 8. We haven't had any issues with it turning her skin green. Looks great and is holding up really well so far. Feels sturdy and not flimsy.
it looks like the pic. it is not tiny dainty. bought it for my granddaughter, she love it.
My daughter has worn in the water with out any problems.
It's 16" long and stretches which is why my daughters broke right away as she kept pulling it on and off over her head instead of using the clasp.
yes. only a few because I haven't worn it many places yet. But I will for sure. it will be a gift for two girls that are very excited to get it. everyone in my house and whoever has seen it has said it was beautiful.
I don't really know so I'm beting that it will come in the same package. But probably in different bags
It is about 1" in length and 1/4" wide at the bottom. The top is smaller and widens out to 1/4" at the bottom. I'll be giving it to my daughter for her birthday this weekend and will let you know what she thinks. She's a huge h2o and Mako mermaids fan
I don't remember there being a box, and I didn't see one in the pictures... but it did come with the bag shown.
My daughter has never brought 2 necklaces together ;)
These are much thinner than my Balega socks. I thought they would be comparable, but they're really not. I wear my Balega's when running and these for other times...they're too thin for me.
S = 6 - 7.5, M = 8 - 9.5, L = 10+ This is based on shoe size. I read reviews that said they run small, but I disagree. Stick with the Asics size chart for proper compression and support sizing!
My wife wears size 8.5 shoe but the small Asics socks fit her perfectly.
no, they are not right or left foot specific.
I had no problems with slipping at all
US Women's Shoe Size XS 4 - 5.5 S 6 - 7.5 M 8 - 9.5 L 10+
I oaid $10!!
I don't know if they're considered running socks as they aren't heavily padded. I use them for walking 3-5 miles and they work great! My running socks are thicker for more cushion during the run, but if you don't feel the need for extra padding then these would work just fine.

Guessing the "M" means medium width.
It's the typical 3 hole pattern designed to fit the SPD-SL cleats (or Look cleats for that matter). I'm using the adapter to mount my speed plays to them.
No. Cleats usually come with pedals.
Pedals of kaiser cycle need to be compatable with your cleats. Simply remove the pedals on the cycle with a pedal removal tool that you want to use and put on the same type pedals that are on your cleats. As long as the owner/manager of the gym allows you to change them, it is pretty easy.
11.5 what size is it
No they won't. The PD-A600 require 2 holes, these shoes have 3 holes. SPD-SL pedals are what you need
The pd-90000 appears to have a standard 3 bolt pattern so I would be very surprised if it doesn't.

11.5 what size is it
No they won't. The PD-A600 require 2 holes, these shoes have 3 holes. SPD-SL pedals are what you need
The pd-90000 appears to have a standard 3 bolt pattern so I would be very surprised if it doesn't.
I had some type of grease where I was able to remove enough to where it wasn't so noticeable. I'd say about 95% of it. But it does take some effort. Good luck.
I found this on line: Unlike smooth leather, which can look great distressed and beat up, suede and nubuck leather just looks old and tired. Pedag's Suede, Sheepskin and Nubuck Leather Care Kit contains the tools you need to keep your shoes, boots, clothes, and even furniture looking like new. First, use the brass bristles on the Suede Brush to remove surface dirt (on Nubuck Leather be more gentle), use the side fan to get into the welt and other tight spots to remove dirt. Next take the Suede Care Color Restorer and press the sponge applicator against the shoe until the liquid contents start to flow. Evenly cover the surface with the sponge applicator and allow the liquid to dry for about 10 minutes. The Suede Care Color Restorer renews the color (neutral color will brighten and refresh all colors, but does not ADD color), while it also helps repel dirt and water. Next use the soft rubber bristles of the Suede Brush to restore the luxurious nap that makes suede and nubuck so lovely. Experiment: brush the suede, sheepskin or nubuck with the grain for a smooth soft color or against the grain of the leather for a brighter color and a different look. Finally, when you inevitably get marks or oily spots on the leather, use the Suede Cleaner dry cleaning block to remove them. Follow with a coat of the Color Restorer, brush and your suede and nubuck is good to go. Please note: When using the Suede Brush and Suede Cleaner on nubuck leather apply less muscle and a more delicate touch. Nubuck is durable but is usually not as thick as suede. Finally, Color Care helps repel water, but it is not a complete waterproofer. Pedag makes a spray that is ideal for all leathers and textiles, but other manufacturers do too. If your items have high tech breathable membranes (as many hiking and outdoor boots and trail runners do), be sure the waterproofer does not clog the pores (does not contain silicone for example). All items in this kit, and our spray, are compatible with high tech membranes.
I do not know. I purchased the product to clean a stain (undetermined origin) on suede pants. It did the job without removing color from the suede pants. That's all I can tell you.
I used it on a cream colored suede headboard. It blends right in with no streaking or residue marks
I would get the black. It will make it "richer" black. The black nubuck gets slightly faded in places and this will make it look better.
Yes. I think it should be fine. In fact it makes sense to thoroughly clean the suede before sealing it.
No, I don't think so. It didn't work on tan suede. I think its ineffective
Working on suede is not easy, its pretty delicate, but you can try.
I don't have a measuring device handy, but the bristles are about inch long and the bristle surface is about 1x2 inches, not large (the size is smaller than two of my thumbs, and I'm very petite). It is double sided, with bristles on one side and textured plastic on the other. The edges also have plastic ridges used for scraping. The plastic is not hard, more rubbery, and did not scratch the surface of my Frye boots.
Dear customer: It is not listed as for the iPad. The dimensions are as follows. Internal Dimensions: Length 7.9"x Width 5.9"x Height 11".
The only issue I have with this bag, is the lack of a place to put my water bottle in. I sort of hang the bottle on the outside of the bag.
No, sounds perfect. With all the padding this bag has it fills up pretty quickly.
I carry two Pentax K30 bodies one with a Sigma 10-20 and the other with a Pentax 55-300 in the bottom compartment with lots of room for a couple primes, batteries, etc in the top compartment.
I have a canon 60D with battery grip and it fits great!
Yeah, definitely. Great for a single body and few lenses. You could put the flash in the top compartment.
Nothing, it's just the bag.
really its 10 X 5.5 X 5.5 really useful to I have it at home all the time just filled with all my cosmetics and stuff like that. good for the price, lasted me awhile to
sure, but I wouldn't put it in the dryer...

I think it is. I always put it on wet surface.
Hi Harold.. the zippers are sturdy and overall a nice bag. Outer layer looks bit cheap quality, but for the price its good
They do not slide at all. They fit nicely together
Yes, each tray is a separate piece.
No
No
Hi, the xmas offer was 50% off; when we changed the offer price we did not update the 50% sale message, apologies. If you still wanted to buy this item we could refund you for the difference. If you wanted to proceed please message us directly. Thanks.
I have definitely seen them cheaper in the last couple months. Keep checking back. I do love these stackers though!!
This is a core range colour and therefore will be available ongoing.
No they are not. So I can't fit some of my earrings in the little squares. But they are very nicely made.
Looks brown to me. Wish items would be good ole fashioned names of Crayola Crayons these days!
Very minimal. Quick assembly.
There is a spot on the top for rings. You could also put earrings in the top as there is an area partitioned off from where the rings would be kept.
I'm 5' tall it comes to my elbows
Offhand, its about 30 inches tall, 9 inches deep and 12 inches wide, with a top open compartment, and three drawers, two side opening necklace hangers. Its sturdy enough but petite enough
Even though the armoire is on the small side, it is well designed with hooks on the two side doors, and drawers for rings and other pieces. I gave it as a gift, so I don't know exactly the number of pieces that would fit. An average collection should fit nicely unless the pieces were unusually large.
I got it for my brother as a gift. He said it didn't have tags but it had a paper inside with Asian writing. He really likes it. It was his first man bag & now knows why women carrying purses.
I don't remember. I don't have the bag anymore. I replaced it because of the problems I had with it.
That would be tough. For sure it would bulge out and be difficult to close with the zipper at the top.
I don't know the exact inside dimensions, but I purchased this messenger bag just to hold my iPad 2, and it fits with a little extra room on all sides. What I really like is that there is enough room to put in sunglasses, a water bottle, an umbrella, Etc.
Sorry, Danny, I have no clue how large a MacBook Air 11 is. Roughly, the interior large pocket of the medium Zicac bag is 8+ inches by 11+ inches.
I think that it indicates a real leather. Very nice purse. Many complements. Weak hardware and the seems and zipper busted. Needed to exchange.
Not that I know of.
About 5 feet. From each side. It has a buckle that will let you shorten the strap to fit well. I really like this purse.
The turnaround time on my purchase was very good.
I am not sure but...I think it is the dye on new leather. Still like the bag.
Like any volatile substance, you will want to apply this outside, but once dry for a day or so, I haven't noticed any odor, and I keep my shoes right by my bed.
It's not for odor removal. It's to seal the sides of the cork on shoes and prevent the cork from breaking down.
This is to keep the cork on the sides of the shoe protected against water and dirt. Not an arch support item.
I'd say yes, but I didn't really notice too much of an odor to begin with
Yes. I use it on my Birks regularly and it is the same stuff.
This is a low-impact bra. I'm an A/B cup and the medium fits great.

Yes, I Found them to fit exactly as expected. In fact, I liked the fit so much, I ordered a 2nd pair.
I ordered the large and found them to be pretty true to size 12-14.
I found them to be pretty much true to size. I generally buy size large. I've had two pairs for a couple months and machine wash them frequently but I do NOT put them in the dryer. They have held up well. (I had previously worn the Target brand crop pants in size large).
Todd.. I bought this for my son and he wears it weekly.. It hasn't shrunk or faded.. He says it is the best feeling, and most comfortable shirt he wears when golfing..
I checked all sewn-in tags on the shirt. (I don't have the purchase tags anymore) It doesn't say regarding level of UV protection, and I can't recall. I would check with PUMA. Sorry I can't be more help.
It's a mens shirt

I would think a ten. My waist is huge for now. I had four compressed fracture vertebra in my thoracic back area last year. My waist expanded due to height decreases to 39 inches. The ltwelves fit fine and will need a bit of tailoring if and when I shrink to a more normal waist line. Good shorts
If you always have extra room in the waist and lower ab area, you can probably stay with the size 8. It's that area it ran smaller on me.
There is one on Dicks Sporting Goods site. not sure of any others.

It is 31 inches tall
It is a good buffer. It is used after one applies the polish, buffs the shoes (with a horse hair brush) then the "final" shine with the buffer. Also it works good in between polishings.
We use the red side for tan and brown shoes
If remember correctly it came as one piece and can not be used without the pole. I put my hand in the shoe with one hand and press the button with other for more detailed polishing .
The tag on it states: 0.6 Amp, 120 volt. It plugs into a regular outlet here in the US but you can stall it if you press too hard. It does the job though as long as you don't use excessive pressure.
Yes. You plug it in. No battery. Mines been great!
I havent bought any, it was a preset for a friend. Sorry
.6 A 120v 72watts
120v
Plugs in. Really a great unit actually, just like the ones they used to have in hotel rooms years ago. Buffs out a great shine in less than half the time it would take manually.
We do not sell this item currently so we do not know to best honest. Thank you.

My daughter wears a size 6 shoe and they fit her.
About 6 inches
I am not sure for dimensions because I bought this to gift some one. I apologies. .
I'm not sure why there is a photo of a tree, the item is actually a pink swing that is about 6"X4"X3".

Yes
Lynne, these are men specific shoes, much wider even in standard D/W sizes. You should try Shimano WR42L women's road cycling shoes. They look almost identical to the SH-R088, have the same strap/locking system, similar sole, and are even equally priced.
Yes - Read a good review of these shoes at http://www.competitivecyclist.com/shimano-sh-r088-shoe-mens.
If you have a spd pedals & cleats you don't need a converter because it fits on 3 & 2 bolt pattern. Hope this would answer your question.
Yes, if you have the clips. If you purchase the pedal it comes with clips or the clips can be purchased separately. Enjoy your day!
I'm a 10.5 regular and the 45 regular width is perfect. The Shimano shoes seem to run a bit smaller than others and you need to go at least a half size up. Regarding the toe straps, yes they would work as long as you didn't install cleats on the bottom of the shoes. You would lose most benefits of the shoe I would think, and would probably be better off just wearing running shoes or tennis sneakers with the toe straps - then at least you can walk around when you're off the bike. these, like basically all road bike shoes, are akin to ice walking when trying to get around.
Yes, you can Google it just type shimano road shoes sizing.
The shoe comes with 2 bolt clips but it can accept 3 bolt clips as well. I have never used 3 bolt clips.
US men's shoe size 8.5 compares to European men's 41-42. I believe they rate a 42 as somewhere between 8.5 and 9. I like the extra toe space esp on long rides in hot weather. By the way, I LOVE the shoes.

You would lose most benefits of the shoe I would think, and would probably be better off just wearing running shoes or tennis sneakers with the toe straps - then at least you can walk around when you're off the bike. these, like basically all road bike shoes, are akin to ice walking when trying to get around.
Yes, you can Google it just type shimano road shoes sizing.
The shoe comes with 2 bolt clips but it can accept 3 bolt clips as well. I have never used 3 bolt clips.
US men's shoe size 8.5 compares to European men's 41-42. I believe they rate a 42 as somewhere between 8.5 and 9. I like the extra toe space esp on long rides in hot weather. By the way, I LOVE the shoes.
l wear 10.5 4E size in NB. l was extremely happy with the width of the 46. l would not go with the (M) medium size if you have an extremely wide foot.
Yes
Lynne, these are men specific shoes, much wider even in standard D/W sizes. You should try Shimano WR42L women's road cycling shoes. They look almost identical to the SH-R088, have the same strap/locking system, similar sole, and are even equally priced.
Yes - Read a good review of these shoes at http://www.competitivecyclist.com/shimano-sh-r088-shoe-mens.
If you have a spd pedals & cleats you don't need a converter because it fits on 3 & 2 bolt pattern. Hope this would answer your question.
Yes, if you have the clips. If you purchase the pedal it comes with clips or the clips can be purchased separately. Enjoy your day!

The product dimensions(in inches)18.2 x 15.2 x 6.7. The handle extends to 16 inches.
It does not lock in place,but I am able to pull it behind me with no problem.
Yes
The suitcase is made of durable synthetic materials.
Do not buy this watch. The battery never worked correctly. Regarding the wristband, it seemed like the standard men's size. It fit my Dad just fine (he is 6ft 1 and average size)--it just wouldn't work properly.
No, just the time.
the instructions that come with the watch are very clear and easy to follow. I had to set the time for a country overseas and was easy to do that. The hands will be set at the time of your choice, the voice, basically reads what the hands show. Unfortunately I can not recall instructions about battery maintenance. Hope this was helpful. Great product haven't received any complaints so far.
Nnenna, Your glasses will fit in this case.
The one that I got the cleaning cloth was included.
6 1/4" x 2 1/4"
Absolutely not. I would trust $5k of camera equipment in it on the back of my motorcycle in a downpour for hours though. It is a rolldown bag. Gravity will keep water out - submersion will not. You need a Pelican case for that application.
NO, That would be hard to still make it waterproof.
Yeah it didn't weigh nearly that much empty. Don't have an actual number for you but it's quite light.
You wind it up on the bottom ...when you open it, the music plays
Check to see if it had a battery that needs to be changed. I gave it to my sister, but she hasn't had any problems with it.
I had mine delivered to my sister so i havent seen it. The description says Approximately 6.75" x 4.5" x 3".
I gave it as a gift, but I'm pretty sure my sister said it was "Amazing Grace".
Yes, with some extra space
Yup, probably 2
Sort of. The end mesh pocket could hold a pair of shoes, but half the shoe would be exposed. The other side has the soiled clothes pocket and that can fit a pair of shoes
Search Google for "on-time atomic talking watch manual" without the quotes. first two results for me were instruction documents. As a general rule, the lower-left button (" 8 o' clock" button) opens and cycles through the menu and confirms setting changes. Hold the 8 o' clock button to open the menu (watch usually announces: "SET ALARM, PRESS 10 O' CLOCK BUTTON TO SET"). With the menu open: Repeatedly press 8 'o clock button to cycle through menu options. Upper-left button ("10 o' clock") selects a menu item to start making setting changes. Upper-right button ("2 o' clock") makes changes to the selected menu setting Lower-right button ("4 o' clock") makes alternate changes to selected menu setting (ie sets minutes when the 2 o' clock button has set hours). 8 o' clock button confirms new setting changes. These are definitive rules, just guidelines. Be sure to set the correct time zone before changing any other settings (typically it's the 4th menu option) Good luck!
Yes, but our instruction book has been misplaced--we have our watch set so that there is no chiming and will talk only when requested but we do not remember how to do this without the instruction book. Independent Living Aids has an instruction manual on-line for free download. Their e-mail is techsupport@independentliving.com
I read the Customer Comments first before purchasing and I gambled on it. After getting the watch I also read very carefully of the instruction and I tried not to set ALL immediately and I only set the Time Zone first. Since it is radio controlled so I let the radio to set the time for me. I think it was about an hour or two later the watch set the hands automatically. On the day to Fall Back I did not turn the hands either, instead, I waited until almost 3 a.m. Sunday the radio automatically set the proper time and I did not have to do anything. I really don't remember everything I did, but the "rule" I followed was not to touch on ALL these buttons. Most of us are rather impatient and we want to know it all immediately. When I realized that the Alarm was set at 3 a.m. by the factory I did not rush to change it until I had time to read the instruction and I did just that little. I'm just guessing: If you, Anita, live on the West Coast, why not set your Time Zone to, say, East Coast Time Zone for one day and watch the hands readjust to the East Coast TZ, then a day later change to the Pacific Time Zone and let the radio to adjust the time but don't expect to see the change promptly. Good luck, we have to help each other in this Internet Era Economy. baoedong@yahoo.com
yes it has a warranty, yess batteries last a year or so, I had mine repaired no problem
It depends on how many times you push the buttons to find out the date or time. Otherwise it will last about a yr or two.
Yes, the hourly time announcements can be turned off
I think it is a man's voice. The voice is not too loud, but loud enough to be heard.
This Atomic Talking Watch from Safeguard is only available with the talking feature. While the button is easy to access there are few "false positives" where the button is compressed to talk on accident. Because of this, the wearer could use the watch but ignore the talking functionality quite easily if that was their preference.
I don't think there is any difference. The one I got for my mother was huge - like a man's.
No, definitely not waterproof!
I found it to be pretty true to size. I bought the same size I buy at Gap and Banana Republic and it fit perfect.
I ordered a medium and it fit exactly like I thought it would... so true to size.
3/4 sleeves
According to the Soybu website, the cardigan is 65% Polyester / 35% Rayon, so not cotton. It does not feel like a polyester sweater though - it has a jersey fabric feel to it.

I'm not a runner. I'm a nurse & work 12hr shifts which included lots of running up & down the hallway to surgery. They stay up very well and also support your arches. One of the docs I work with wears them when running.
I'm a plus size girl and wear a size 10 shoe and I'm 5'9" tall -- that said the Sockwell's always seem to feel like they're too small and waaaaaay to stretched out. If you aren't plus size, it make work though.
These socks seem indestructible. I wash and dry them all the time with no problems
I know they are easier than the ted hose from the hospital. As long as your mother can put her socks on they should be fine depending on the circumference of her leg.
Medium. I wear an 8 and really needed the small
You would want to buy the large size. I went to another website that had a size chart . I wear an 8-81/2 and the large fits well- even after many washings.
I'd suggest the men's, especially if want them to be knee high.
They come up to the bottom of the knees comfortably.
Not sure since they have graduated compression. There is more in the foot and ankle.
not an answer, a question, I wear a size 8 1/2 shoe, what size should I order?

It Is dark navy blue.
No
We've used it as a luggage and we were very pleased with it. We've fill it to the max capacity and never had an issue with it falling over or at least enough for us to notice and become annoying. Very pleased with the purchase.
It's large to wear, my son is 3.5 and my daughter is 1, they like the pulling feature better than the wearing anyway. It's a good size though, it fits all their stuff for a weekend at grandma and grandpas with room to spare :-)

From REI's site, here is the size chart. Sizing: XS fits men's shoe sizes 1-4.5 / women's 2.5-6 S fits men's shoe sizes 5-8.5 / women's 6.5-10 M fits men's shoe sizes 9-11 / women's 10.5-12.5 L fits men's shoe sizes 11.5+ / women's 13+
Yes they come in a pair in the box.
I have been able to fit these over all kinds of running shoes. I have Nike Free's and Asics for running which is my primary use, but I've even slipped them on my Hunter rain boots when it's slick out & I want something taller for walking the dog. I'm wearing a small in the YakTrax Pro and wear a women's 9-9.5. The rubber has a ton of give so you should be able to fit them as long as you get the right size of YakTrax. Check their website if you want more detailed sizing info.
Yes, these are the best things I have found for running, they really stay put and don't damage my running shoes.
from experience: Man's size 9 = medium yaktrax for running shoes and could easily go 2 sizes larger (gauged by ok fit on clunky size 9 men's outdoor boots). My guess is you might want to go to large for men's 12. Woman's size 8 = medium yaktrax (small also fits but for some reason seems not to work well, maybe rubber connectors stretched too far and break more easily with use?).
Using the Yaktrax should be fine. Ive used it last winter on my icy driveway which is inclined.
No. The YakTrax are ok on dry pavement, you will just shorten their life. I always get an extra pair.
I wear size 12.5US and I use the XL size. Anything size 12 or larger I suggest the XL.

it could be hung on the wall but it would need to be taken down everytime you want to take or put your earrings on
My 18" chains hang nicely-they are clasped, but any longer they will touch the table. I have a couple longer necklaces that I hang over the top panel joints and this works nicely for them. Each panel is approx 6" wide and it stands approx 14 inches tall (including the top design. I like mine very much - it holds a lot of jewelry and looks cute on my vanity mirror. I thought is was the best deal for price and amount and types of jewelry it can hold compared to others, and its durability will last a life time, unless seriously abused of course. It holds my watches, bracelets, rings, necklaces and earrings! Jewelry is so much easier to see, select and replace than when sitting in a jewelry box. NO more necklace tangles! You will love it! Hope that helps. :D
I think so. The holes are big enough
Yes it is paintable.
I think they are. I gave the earring organizer to one of my daugther, who is presently out of the country. It's certainly sturdy, but if you want this for a business, you might need several racks...Good luck!
Jewelry holder measurements Folded width 5 7/8" Fully extended width 18" Height tallest part 14 1/4"
It cannot. The left side will only bend back not forward. Still very cute and super effective. I have so much jewelry on this holder. I hope that helps some.
yes, for studs and dangle earrings.
I suppose you could mount the organizer, but I don't believe you would then be able to put your earrings into the holes or take them out very easily.
Black. It is like a metal material so can easily be spray painted to another color.
60 sets of earrings. With 1 extra hole at the end
It is approximately 11&1/2" high --- 14" across --- and the little "feet" on the base are approximately 5" --- hope that helps you.
I do not have any to try but I believe they are thin enough.
no the legs come with it.
Yes, the earring cards do fit on this stand.
Currently only available in black.
14 1/4 inches tall, 11 1/2 inches wide, with a base width of 4inches
I believe that a 13 1/4 inch x 9 inch Dell Ultrabook would fit in the bag. It will be a rather tight fit.
Yes. The picture of the briefcase bag on Amazon.com (looking from the top of the briefcase bag) shows a zippered pocket on both sides of the bag. Looking at the bag from its side, one only sees one zippered pocket; you cannot see the other two zippered pockets from the side of the bag.
No
China, don't waist your money. I only gave it a good review because they called my house and said someone was going to loose their job after i gave it a bad review. I didn't give it the better review until they had called my home many times and constant emails. i have not purchased anything from amazon since. I don't think amazon should let a vendor contact you by phone. Hope this helps
Hi Dear, We can ship items to Romania if you need. While the shipping fee is too high $30 and it might be taxed by your customs. We are not sure for that. Is is OK for you? If yes, you can pls order the bag and we will inform you to pay for the shipping fee. Thanks. Sophia
Of course! There have two section. Also you can use for iPad one from two pocket.
fits just fine, i thought this was a cheap bag but i would highly recommend this one.
It is sewn in and appears as a regular purse divider just thicker. You would have to cut the divider out, but I wouldn't.
Legal size would not fit
no the inside is very small.I bought as a gift and had to return it to China.Return was smooth but an unwanted holiday job.
male voice - slow and very clear - you cannot go wrong buying this watch for a person with low vision.
Yes, but it can be shortened, we had a jeweler take the links out
I sold a lot of these watches to customers in Arizona and never had this problem. Try this if you set the watch to Central time you should pick up the extra hour.
it speaks only when the appropriate button (lower right) is pushed so the wearer has control of when it speaks. i rely heavily on my watch every day. billie adrian bijjie1@aol.com
I bought this last year for my father in law. He had macular degeneration and other health problems. He loved the watch. Unfortunately, he passed away in October 2014.
This watch is only good for the U S
When you set the time you hear the time first. Then you confirm the time. Then the hands move t
I will scan the instructions from the pamphlet I received with my watch and I will attach a file for you to follow. I do not know if Amazon accepts jpeg images/files. rlf &lt;&gt;&lt;
I am not sure. I purchased for my dad for Christmas. He had not opened yet.
you must push the button on the right side of the watch for it to talk.
It is a semi fit in my opinion. It contours to the body and doesn't cling. It could be best described as a fitted race singlet. I believe the picture provided for this product us an accurate representation of the way it fits.
No, there is not a bra inside this shirt. This may not be correct but most singlets I have purchased do not have bras inside them. The tanks I have purchased that do have "bras" inside them don't have very much support and I typically wear a sports bra anyway.
No, this does not have a built in bra.
Depends on how you want it to fit. For a more relaxed fit, I'd size up. I got a small. I'm 5'1", 108 lbs. The small is relatively long and loose on me. The XS would have been a bit clingier and shorter than I'd want.
It does not...
I 'm 5'5'' and it hits about mid hip.
I did not find this shirt to be warm at all, I actually returned it for something else.
According to the Asics site, it doesn't describe any UPF. You will be covered though, and it's a pretty fine mesh, so it doesn't let a lot of sun through.

The Chirp Jewelry Armoire has ring holders and four center storage areas under the lid along with a mirror, six storage drawers behind doors, and four hooks inside each door.
I opened the doors and drawers of the armoire and put a fan blowing on it, in my garage for several days. The odor lessened and we put it in the house. I don't notice the odor anymore, but I don't know what caused the smell.
No
It came in one piece. Very well wrapped and protected. This is a solid piece of furniture as well as being beautiful. I have gotten many compliments on it in the short time I've had it.
I don't recall the exact weight but do remember it was quite heavy. It was approximately 30 -35 lbs. it too two of us to carry it into our bedroom. The unit is all solid wood and built very well. It's a great unit. Also, we got free shipping.
On the inside of top. I love this!
Just inside the doors. It is a nice piece of furniture though.
There are some special considerations when shipping to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Expedited and Priority Shipping for Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico can't be sent to P.O. boxes or APO, FPO OR DPO. Some items from our Tools & Hardware, Electronics, and Outdoor Living stores can't be shipped to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico if they are extremely heavy, oddly-shaped, or considered hazardous. Additionally, some items from our Health and Personal Care and Grocery stores cannot be shipped to these destinations. Check the item's product detail page for eligibility and available shipping options. Only specific shipping options may be available for some addresses. Available shipping options will appear at checkout when you enter a shipping address.
The top does not open up.
Each top drawer (behind doors) is lined with dark brown felt. The two bottom drawers are not lined but are painted inside like the outside. It is a very lovely armoire. Well made.
Great question! This item has three pieces of velcro, which when adhered to the inside of the goggles will stay put and fit nicely.
This item does just sit under the goggles. It is 12" across and 2 3/4" tall. Please let us know if you have any other questions.
I have never had mine fog since using this product. Really keeps your nose warm.
Thank you for your question. The Nose Mitten is a constructed fleece nose covering that attaches to the base of the goggle, it does not cover the nostrils and will not obstruct breathing.
Zach, Thank you for your question. We don't actually sell the goggles. We sell the fleece underneath, which is the nose mitten. This photo was just to show our product in use. If you have any other questions please just let us know. Thank you
Yes!
Like wrap as a gift? Probably best to be put in a gift bag
This hat is appropriately sized for children and smaller adults.
Yes. I have a rather large head if I must say but it fit. Just a little tight
Yes
I'm not sure what fleece you're referring to, but my head is pretty big and this hat fit me just fine. The material is very high quality, too.
I'm not sure about size. I have the deluxe and it fits fine. Although when strapped it makes my head look a little funny due to the fact that I do not have a square cartoon head. There is a little extra padding on the top/ears so they kind of point up/out instead of just up like the fleece one appears to do. But I can't say for sure. The curvature of our normal heads might make the ears always point out regardless of which hat is worn. Overall I love mine.. you don't get the many faces of Finn with the fleece hat.
I think so. I have a 104cm waist/100cm hips and wear the 34's comfortably. The 36's (and i wear loose fit 36 jeans) are a little on the large side, and while usable, the 34's are much better for me. I assume the 30/32 would be similar.
I got them in a 38 and they were a little small, all my other shorts ( the same size ) fit quite a bit looser. So for bigger guys i might go a size bigger.
The inseam is 10 inches. Great shorts!
These shorts are great for anything. I've had my one pair for a couple years now and they look only a tad worn and I train MMA 5 days a week. They hold up great to impact, tugging, and dragging. I'm 220lbs and these shorts fit great too. I got this helps! Oss!
Mine have s 9 inch inseam and are about 2 inches above the knee (they're a little baggy)
No, no pockets..
They do not have a liner inside.
Same shorts. Different size rating.
Nope...no liner. They are pretty much like board shorts with a little stretch in them.
I have worn them to the beach on many occassions and they dry within minutes after getting out of the water. Nothing better out there for the money.

Mine have s 9 inch inseam and are about 2 inches above the knee (they're a little baggy)
No, no pockets..
They do not have a liner inside.
Same shorts. Different size rating.
Nope...no liner. They are pretty much like board shorts with a little stretch in them.
I have worn them to the beach on many occassions and they dry within minutes after getting out of the water. Nothing better out there for the money.
I think so. I have a 104cm waist/100cm hips and wear the 34's comfortably. The 36's (and i wear loose fit 36 jeans) are a little on the large side, and while usable, the 34's are much better for me. I assume the 30/32 would be similar.
I got them in a 38 and they were a little small, all my other shorts ( the same size ) fit quite a bit looser. So for bigger guys i might go a size bigger.

It works on soft and supple. Just slight change of color. Will NOT work on split leather
Not sure; I would say to use the trial and error method as every situation is different. Look at the leather after each use. Does it look like the inside is getting wet? Does the top layer still look like it did after you first applied. With heavy use and frequent exposure to wet conditions I would say a light retouch to a CLEAN AND DRY BOOT could be made every month. However it could be a longer or shorter period of time depending. Hope this helps!
us a litte heat put your boots in front of the heat register then apply snow seal, you can also set snow on the register to soften.
Yes, the waterproofing coat on your boots wears off with wear and needs to be reapplied. I have tried many products and Sno-Seal is the best one I have used.
I put the sno seal on a new pair of Irish Setter huntting boots. It works best if the boots are warm and dry.
it'll work fine dude, just make sure you do it right the first time so you don't have to deal with the bad job and do it over again.
I use the 7 oz size to treat my saddle bags and all the leather on my FLSTC boots gloves jacket and vest 1 can will last for a year,4 times a year snow seal if used correctly goes a long way. Correct use can be found online.
The label on the package says "Made in the USA since 1933"
I'm not sure about waxed cotton - but Barbour - the British waxed cotton coat folks would know and as far as the hats - if it is a leather hat I think you okay as long as you do the whole outside - but it depends so also use the sno seal website
I never used that product, but SnoSeal, is the best product of its kind I've found
To me it's normal tie size
Were you able to solve this issue? I am not sure why it is doing that.
Shipping to Singapore would take about 7-10 days. If you order from our Chippendales website you can choose Express shipping which will get it there in about 5 days.
I'm not sure if it's "real" silk. It does look very nice. I'll check the label tonight and respond.
yes. rolls up to hide if not needed.
Same size just worded different.
I wear a medium and found that the large size is just right to fit over work clothes.
Two large mesh pockets on the inside.
No. Just a rain jacket.
I'm 5'10" 165lbs and bought a large so I could where a bulky sweatshirt or fleece underneath. The sizing chart is accurate - go by that. BTW, I bought the Gage rain suit and it has been the best rain protection I have ever had, including L.L. Bean.
We only have the size Large Garden Boots listed for sale at this time. We are sorry for any inconvenience.
I think they run small. I vaguely remember someone saying that in their review. So went a size up because I have wide feet. I wear one pair of socks and the boots fit tight.
I wear size 7 1/2 shoes and bought size 8 which fit nicely over my shoes. This is women's size. I'm not sure if that was listed as large or what and there is no size marked on the boots.
Comes in one size only. The boots are roughly a size 9.
with a full bladder in the water bottle pouch you could fit another water bottle on the opposite side in the compartment and maybe something small besides. Above the camera container, you'd have room for maybe 2 sweatshirts.
I run a 2L Camelbak Antidote Reservoir in mine, which is what it is advertised as being designed for. So, yes, and 2L(70 oz) is the biggest you can fit in it.
Yes
One main compartment from top to bottom, drawstring closure at the top or unzip as shown to access the lower area where the camera carrier sits. No separate camera compartment - it's a removable case that sits inside. There is a small section at the top of the bag big enough for a paperback book or something. hope that helps.
No
Two tags

The buckles are a shiny stainless steel. The bag is lined with nylon except for the top flap, which has a suede-like lining. There is a zipper compartment in the middle of the bag but it is not padded. I carry my laptop in a sleeve I already owned.
Yes, I carry a laptop and a portfolio in one section of mine and that leaves the other completely free for charger, pens and other miscellaneous items. Between the laptop and the portfolio it is nearly 4" and it has room to spare including the entire front portion which can carry another book or two.
I haven't noticed any color fade. Although I have only owned my bag since July. And my bag was pretty much the color of the one pictured. Hope this helps.
Fits under the seat. Love bag. Which the straps buttoned instead of old fashion holes.
Yes it will def fit 15 inch laptop I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift. He loves it, The bag is awesome
yes. Of course.
It's pretty big and pretty heavy. Not optimal for air travel.
No they are actually buckles, there a little time consuming at first till you get them broke in.
Yes it can, though I have not done so yet.
I carry around my business laptop (HP Probook 6570b) in it all the time, and there is room to spare. The laptop is a 15" model, so I think your 17.5" should fit. I would measure the bag but I don't have a tape measure on me.
I think it will be big for a 5 year old. I discovered 2 issues with it for my 8 year old .. 1. With the box being tall, it lays on the shoulders and for small children - the top of their heads don't reach the sizing cardboard at the inside top of the box. 2. If it does reach the sizing cardboard, it still is on the bigger side. We didn't mind because we used it for a birthday party. We covered the eyes with a piece of black construction paper and put it on the kid's heads for pin the tail on the pig! He still LOVES it and wears it around the house, but that's it.
It comes flat ready to assemble. It should easily fit into a suitcase.
The head fits inside the mask/box. The cut out box holes are for the eyes. Hope this helps.
Yes. My son was 10 when I bought it for him last year !
I am not sure of the exact weight, but my guess would be a pound once it's folded.
Actually yes you could but you do have holes for the eyes and I think the mouth
Yes. Any country. Just place an order and shipping cost table will show up.
yes it is 12"x12" we measured
The inner dimensions for bed legs are 2 5/8 inch square with rounded corners
1 book - 1 3/4 inches, 2 books - 3 3/4, 3 books - 5 3/4.
We bought them a year ago and I had the same concern. So far that has not been an issue but I made sure they were squared off when set the same as the bed otherwise a point could be an issue!
It has 12 pieces 3 piece risers. I like the a lot! They worked great for me.
Yes. Absolutely. Will be stable, like one solid piece, no wobbling.
I wouldn't use it in the summer. It has just enough insulation to make you hot in the summer.
It's made in Indonesia however they r true size. No bootleg jacket. Good quality material. Zippers will out last jacket .Gd material.Deep pockets. If u want 2 layer I wud suggest sizing up. Hope u find info handy.
It runs on the fitted side. Id order what you normally get in t-shirt
It's about 20" long, I measured from where the seam is joined at the armpit to the bottom of the jacket.
It's not a question of loud! The problem is the material is a **Wrinkle Magnet** if your interested in looking squard away this jacket is not for you Semper FI
Its pertty quite, you would really have to be listening closley to hear anything.
3XL, especially for CCW.
I'd go with a medium. I'm 5' 10", 180 and mine fits just about perfect
They appear to be true to size. I had to get one size larger since I wear it on duty over gear and body Armor. I would NOT recommend this jacket however. It will not keep you warm... At all. Several others I work with really like the condor soft shell jackets.
I am 5'11" 205lbs, the large fits me great. Slim fit , but still plenty of room to move around.

The kit includes the shoes the pedals and the cleats
Hi dale!! Im 11 too... I bought 46 and its perfect :)
47 =size 12. They do run a title bit larger so the 12 is a 12 &1/2
I've never tried a Shimano shoe before but I found that the US to European sizing chart was accurate so I would suggest using that rather than assuming a Shimano 42 will match a venzo 42.
I found these to run a tad big. I wear a 11 and am good with a 10.5.
They are great you won't be disappointed I average 150 miles a day. they are built to last well worth the money
The kit includes the shoes the pedals and the cleats
Hi dale!! Im 11 too... I bought 46 and its perfect :)
47 =size 12. They do run a title bit larger so the 12 is a 12 &1/2

I've had mine for 3 years and it's still working
Correct, no sound at all, it is not able to.... we have used it four times now with no problems at all. And their scores went up each time!
NO. It is pre-programmed just for the ACT exam.
don't know
No that is not an option... At least on the version I purchased
Hold the 'Watch Mode' button until it starts blinking, and then use 'Test Mode' to go higher (no way to go lower)
No, the time is set and you can't add any time to the watch.
The announcement from the ACT, as I understand it, was that the future changes in the test would not occur until 2016, so the current watch is still good. For complete safety, I would recommend that you check the ACT website, as they are the final authority.
Look around the perimeter of the watch screen, there should be a line that is sectioned off into like 4 sections for reading and 5 for science and so on
Yrs
yes but it was broken after the second day.
yes it does come in english this watch pairs by bluetooth to ur cellphone when u have a incoming call itdisplays that callers number also u can save ur contacts from u cell to ur watch so u dont have to dial in the numbers it also vibrates on incoming calls then u can press the pickup button to take the call yes u press a button to detach the watch then u can talk on it like a reg cellphone this is very great i travel a lot and dont like pulling my( high-price) phone out in strange shady places be smart and hide ur smartphone with this and stay in contact
Yes
Average watch size works really well
It's a piece of crap if that helps!
actually after you buy this watch you find it only bluetooth headset no more and there is no phone no sim slot nothing my advice don't buy from this seller
this watch has a (ear speaker ) u put to ur ear when in a call the ear speaker is like the ones in a cellphone
works with all bluetooth cellphones just like the bluetooth earphones it great
It is a bluetooth watch, but it's absolute garbage, stay away from it don't waste your money on it!
I used with iphone 5. But I think you can use with iPhone 5c
No, it's as difficult as you might imagine. You see out of the mouth, between the teeth. You know when you're taking off a tshirt and your head is inside and you can see out of the neck hole? It's like that.
It's very easy to put on and take off. Remember to air it out for a few days before you try to use it, yes the smell is strong
How long of a snout do you need and for what reason? Worked for me.

If I were you, yes I would. I have had to stretch a pair of shoes three or four times before I was satisfied with the fit. So I would think the larger size stretchers would work better for you. Hope this helps.
? I don't think so. sorry i can't be more help
Yes, there is an adjustment that opens the front part of the stretcher, if you also need extra width. Hope this helps.
Yes. I have't had a problem doing that. Just do it slowly.
They will stretch length as well
I'm sorry but I only used the stretchers for shoes.I used them with the liquid ,it worked pretty good.
These are womens if you see the title it says "Shoe Stretchers Womens" So the size you are ordering should be a womens size
If you have a shoe repair store in your area, then I would start by taking the shoe to the store. They may have the proper tools to help you.
No not for boots, these are made for shoes that are heels or flat if the shoe is is boot like made for example having the closure in the back it will not work. There are on the market stretchers made for boots you can use for some mid top sneakers but not boots
Women sizes 5-9
No
Answering on behalf of my grandmother: the voice is seemingly loud in a quiet room, but it needs to be held up closer to her ear in a crowded room/restaurant, etc.
Yes, it gives you the day, date and time--very easy to understand. My 95 year old, blind, father, uses it with good recognition.
American
just don't push either the 2 or 4 o'clock buttons on the side of the watch. If you don't push them, the watch will not tell you the time or day and date.
yes it is and its a good watch I like it alot
I don't recall it coming with a warranty
I have no idea--but if an atomic clock does, the same technology should apply.
I have no idea--sorry!
It did change time zone between us and Germany not sure about Arizona Thx

I would say Large.
Check the exact size at http://www.underarmour.com.sg/en-sg/size-chart-page.html. I always measure my kids size before ordering & the size always fits. Beware of the series though. Compression is really compression & fits very tightly. For casual use, fitted is a better option.
It should be tight but I would suggest a medium for size 7 or 8. Plus kids grow so fast at that age.
Youth large 12-14
I thought the sizing was spot on! The only advice is that I would error on the side of it being too small rather than too large. I know that my sons like their Under Armour to be form fitting.
My grandson is an 8 yr old and wouldnt say he is thin. Normal shirt size his mither tells me to get is a medium. However, this shirt is designed to fit tighter than UA's other styles. She said to get a large in this style because the medium is to snug. He is tall for his age but not thin or husky. Hope this helps.
Medium

The cleaner is supplied with a stainless steel mesh bottom basket that utilizes the complete area. It is wire framed with no sides.
Tank Capacity: 2500 ml; Tank size: 250 x 150 x 80 mm (L x W x H)
Yes it does
Este aparelho funciona para limpeza de metais e outros, somente limpa no d brilho, o calor ajuda na melhor limpeza.
It is an accessory of a smartphone like iPhone or Android phone, so you have to connect it to the phone to make calls, answer calls, get messages, etc.
Def not sorry, do not get it wet !!!
Yes. There are many collections (http://www.imsmart.com/en/i-m-watch/collections/tech). What we selling is standard collection. If you have any questions about product, you can ask for press centre(http://www.imsmart.com/en/contacts/press-centre).
No
Yes it does. iOS 7
No the watch isn't waterproof it is genuine don't really know about the warranty it is from Italy
Yes by Bluetooth the apps never worked and I do have iOS on my iPhone , I also asked I'm watch company on Facebook but couldn't figure out why the apps are not connecting . Let me know if you have anymore questions . Thank you
Yes, you can make calls and receive calls using the watch with its handsfree speaker or earphone, read SMS, missed call information as well. The battery normally last for two days standby, depends on how frequently you use it.
Black with silver
It's good color spray. I don't know if it contains formaldehyde.
Yes. I bought this to refinish a pair of my wife's very expensive high heels. She was nervous at first thinking it would flake off in the courtroom or stain her nylon feet but it has held up extremely well. Of course in her profession her footwear does not take a beating.{LAWYER} I guess it all depends on what your shoes go through. All in all has worked well or I would not have lived to see my 37th birthday this month. LOL. Hope this helps.
You possibly could, But it may flake after leather has its natural wear and tear...
Yes you can. It doesn't chip.
I guess that would depend on the size of a jacket. But this can definitely cover a medium sized leather jacket.
No it doesn't. It still cracks, but everytime I reapply it, the cracks are masked. It beats shining boots and gear for hours though.
No
It will not rub off. Be sure to give it plenty of time to dry.
I used it on glossy blacK and bright orange Harley bags on my Harley with no primer and so far so good. The bright orange is covered great and does not bleed through at all.
Yes
I'm a size 14 and it fit perfect. I felt that it was a lil stretchy so I'd say a size 16 or 18 might be okay as well.
Yes, it is a polished gold. There is a plastic protective covering over it.
Yes it is, i am very happy with mine :)
Nope
Metal part: approx. 25 x 6 cm/ 9.84"x 2.36",3-7days to deliver
Hello. It's shipped from New Jersey.
It's not really long, but it has a great stretch
The item is shipped within 1 business day and will arrive between 2-5 business days
Yes it might be but it is an elastic .I think you should try it, worst case scenario cut the elastic and make it smaller. Saw it back. It is a cool belt !!!
I am size 12 and I didn't have any problems with it, and didn't unhook when sat down or danced like some belts do.
Yes.
I got mine in 8 days. Ordered 9/24/13, arrived 10/2/13. I ordered a unicorn from sheenroad (also out of China) that took 15 days. Oh, I now see that this is being sold by sheenroad, when I ordered it was sold by Kingmys.
Thanks for your asking. All of our item was fulfilled by Amazon, and the standard shipping is 5-7 days. While if you are in a hurry, you can choose a second-day shipping or one-day shipping.
I have a big head, and it fit with plenty of room. Your big head will smell like plastic though. It takes a few days to air out...and even then. It's a funny mask though. Plus it's not a hard fitting mask, so it will form around your head. Worst case scenario, if your head is giant, you might have a slightly abnormal shaped horse head on the sides. For the price, I'd get it. Lots of fun.
Yes
the mouth and nostrils are open, it is what you see out of. It does not detract from the look of the mask, which I am very happy with.
Thank you for asking. The item will be shipped to USA within 2 days after you place the order. And the standard shippment will take 5-7 days to your place. While if you want to get it earlier, you can choose the one-day shipping or two-day shipping. Hope this will help for you.
Hi, thank you for asking, we offer with free shipping by Amazon. So please contact the Amazon Customer Service for the shipping details.
We can't speculate without knowing where you live. It seems to have taken about 11 days (9 business days) for me and the average from China to U.S. I ordered the 14th, received the 25th. If you're not in the U.S. I have no idea. I hope you had a Halloween back-up, I did just in case!
hello dear friend thanks for you email. Are you had order it?could you kindly give me the order ID, i will tracking it and tell you the tracking information in time. any other question pls feel free to contact me , we will try our best to serve you best regards kaka HBetterTech Corp.
I have had the upper part fillef with reels and water and no removes trays with no sagging. Great bag. Very well made.
It's green and has a hi-low regular white lite, as well. The light also swivels so that you can see inside the pack in the dark
The color is exactly as it looks... brown green olive tan whatever
No, but the side pouches can hold water bottles.
Zippers have held up well, they are not metal but seem to be a heavy duty plastic or poly. No rusting on the jetty!
There are elastic straps on the bag you could tie to, but nothing specifically for a rod.
Comes with 4 good high quality trays
The bag has a pliers holder with a build in "keeper" clip In it, I have used a normal 8 in pliers with no issue. I would say unless you are going for extremes any normal "hand sized" fishing pliers will fit just fine.
I use plano 3600 and 3607 boxes in my wild river backpack.the 3600 & 3607are 10 and three quarter inch long. the 3650 is 11 inches long according to planos website, width & hight are the same. the wild river fishing backpack will accommodate that extra quarter of an inch.
Yes there is. The top compartment above the plano box storage compartment is insulated to use as a cooler and for bait.
I don't know the weight limit but I do know my sons straps started falling apart and he's only had it a short time.
I have not had to inquire about warranty, my son has used this every day since August and it seems durable...he loves it. However, any item I have purchased on amazon thus far, I have had no problem returning except one recently they charged me a 20 percent restock fee, which was ridiculous.
Yes, its a pocket not a mesh. I bought the camo model. Hope that helps you, excuse my english. Its a big backpack, really comfortable.
Yes, it's huge and sturdy. The laptop pocket is great with lots of cushion for protection.

My kids don't use a laptop in it, but it would probably fit a small to medium one. The backpack in general is excellent.

The watch does not need recharging or batteries because of the nuclear fission that is happening inside the watch. It has to do with the radioactive (but safe) hydrogen atoms destroying themselves over time with a half-life age of 12.3 years. Thus, the watch's glow will last at least 24 years. The claim of no maintenance is one made by the manufacturer, and we think they mean that there is no maintenance needed for the glow of the watch. However, if something were to break on the strap, for example, then obviously some maintenance may be needed.
We do not ship internationally through Amazon, I am sorry.
the watch is labeled "Fascinations". So far it's operating quite well.
Yes it can, once properly folded at the top and the air release valve is closed.
Here are the dimension of the backpack and if there is any other questions you have please feel free to ask. I hope this helped. Materials: High Quality Marine Grade Vinyl Volume: 35 Liters / 2135.8 cubic inches Weight: 3 lbs Dimensions: 28" x 15" x 9" Pockets / Straps: External: 2 top tote handles: 1 rubber coated, 1 nylon 3 stitched loop daisy chains Durable coated mesh front pocket Mesh side tall water bottle pocket Two adjustable length utility cords Internal: 35 liter 100% water proof main compartment 1 front internal zip convenience pocket
Not sure pretty durable I would say at least 20lbs
No, the hip strap cannot be tucked away. But a solution is you can fold the hip straps in and tie them up with rubber bands or hair ties.
It does not. It only have one pocket on the inside.
Will have to look but it's a great piece of gear. Saw it on display at Annapolis boat show. Will get back to u. Russ
it's huge.. easily a 17" ...
Yes
It is essentially one large compartment with a pocket for your wallet.
They're not. The shoulder straps can be shorten or extended at the bottom and at the buckles for the hip straps. The opening at the top is also tapered. Bought the pack for my electronics but the hole was a bit small to squeeze through.
It depends on what size your kid wears now and how fast they grow. A medium is size 10-12, large is 14-16
It ran pretty true to size but the sleeves are tight, I believe they are meant to be that way.
Yea it's pretty think enough to keep u warm
It is on both sides, however all,the stones have fallen out
Yes:-)
Yes, it works, but it just slides on and off it doesn't twist on like the pandora charms. I had it on the end and every time I took the bracelet off, it would come off. I fixed that problem by putting the Yankee charm on first then a real pandora charm. Now when I take the bracelet off nothing falls off.
they are more than 1/4" thick and less than 1/2" thick. they are a little too wide also, from neck to shoulder, i am going to cut them down and stitch them on my sewing machine. otherwise i like them
These shoulder pads come in the colors of Beige, Black, and White
yes
These shoulder pads are 1 1/4" thick.
These do not have the velcro straps attached to the shoulder pads
Yes but I attach Velcro to fix to the seam in the blouse or sweater or sew a piece of Velcro in my shirts and should pad. I don't like it attached to my bra straps because I many times wear strapless bras..
Yes Olga it was foam. And they hold up pretty good. Hope this helps..
Clips are made of very hard metal, very sharp, very strong. And yes they pop off, like all clip suspenders, but not as easily as most. Easy to unlatch them by rubbing into things, but they are very sharp and tend to stay in place until you refasten. They will chew holes in your waistbands. Worst problem is they slip off if the sharp tips aren't aligned closely - and they are very hard to bend into proper alignment, made of some metal "not of earthly origin." Still, they are the best I've found so far, and keep one's freak flag flying. Good luck.
We purchased these for a girls hip hop dance all girls were between 4'10 and 5'3 these are HEAVY duty fairly large (wide) suspenders great quality. So would they fit - yes.. But they will probably look pretty large on a child.
They are exactly 2inches wide, real leather brace, and strong alligator style clips
Yes they would.
They're for adults!

I wear a size 8/10 and a lg fits me we'll. A med would have been way too tight
I carry a 380 Bodygaurd and it is very secure. The shorts are pretty short, so I wear other ones over them, allowing for even more support. I haven't had any problem with the gun slipping up.
After the first few times that my wife wore these with her S&W shield(slightly smaller than your beretta), she was not certain that the firearm would not fall out. she quit wearing them. so my answer is no, they would not. However, she does have the shirt also and wears that regularly.
I think that should be fine. The pockets are stretchy but firm.
Those should be fine.
I've not tried running with it, but for general town activities, getting in and out of the car, shopping, walking, etc., it stays snugly in place.
I'd say yes. They are not much different than sports shorts, they are the same thickness of any sports shorts I've ever felt. I wear them under my jeans, they allow for great concealment.

I agree! I ordered 4 and 3 of the 4 were broken..
Yes that's what I use it for. All my mac lipstick
Yes
No! It doesn't fit an nail polish's!! It's only for lipsticks!
The pegs between the two round acrylic blades are a little over 1".
I've been wearing it as a cover over a down jacket, and my jacket has not been getting wet. I also wore it over a sweatshirt on a cruise ship in Glacier Bay. My camera got too wet to use again, but my sweatshirt stayed dry. I guess I should have used the jacket to cover the camera too.
Hi. I like this jacket...the hood does not come off, it is attached. But, the jacket is very light and packable, and the hood rolls down and secures with a velcro tab, like a rolled collar. I hope this helps.
Yes, it is VERY compact and thin. Balled up, it is the size of a large grapefruit at most.
It fits true to size, so just go by your shirt size.
Yes
POLYESTER
Below the waist, it also covers a jacket I wear underneath.
It will defiantly wrinkle of u scrunch it up. But it does in wrinkle after being hung for a while.
Two zippered pockets near the waist.
I bought a white one, it does have a hood. Love it.
Size Medium usually refers to a child's size 10 - 12.
The sizes are for children and fit the 8 and 11 year old just fine.
See White Sierra's sizing chart at REI's website: http://www.rei.com/sizefinder/Whitesierra.html.

I'm a size 14 and it fit perfect. I felt that it was a lil stretchy so I'd say a size 16 or 18 might be okay as well.
Yes, it is a polished gold. There is a plastic protective covering over it.
Yes it is, i am very happy with mine :)
Nope
Metal part: approx. 25 x 6 cm/ 9.84"x 2.36",3-7days to deliver
Hello. It's shipped from New Jersey.
It's not really long, but it has a great stretch
The item is shipped within 1 business day and will arrive between 2-5 business days
Yes it might be but it is an elastic .I think you should try it, worst case scenario cut the elastic and make it smaller. Saw it back. It is a cool belt !!!
I am size 12 and I didn't have any problems with it, and didn't unhook when sat down or danced like some belts do.
No. You can access the online program 24 hours a day, 7 days a week online, but conversing with native speaking individuals or groups to immerse yourself in practicing speaking a new language is limited to 2- 25 minute sessions every 30 days per Rosetta Stone Customer Service.
No.
I used my iPad and my PC to access online and it works fine.
yes u can no problem
No. You have only one choice.
We currently have it on a Kindle, i pad, and an i phone at the same time. Works great!
No. The 12 month program is for 1 language only. You have to pay again for any additional languages you want to learn.
Yes. Here are the system requirements from the Rosetta Stone website: MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS- TOTALe ONLINE Windows: XP SP3, Vista SP2, Windows 7, or Windows 8 Mac (Intel based only): Snow Leopard, Lion, Mountain Lion (OS X 10.6 or higher) Internet Explorer 7, Firefox 4, Safari 5, Chrome 8 or greater Adobe Flash Player version 10.3 or greater On Windows: 2.33GHz or faster x86-compatible processor OR Intel Atom 1.6GHz or faster processor for netbooks On Mac: Intel Core Duo 1.33GHz or faster processor 1GB RAM or higher 1024 x 768 display resolution High-Speed Internet connection (at least 768Kbps) USB headset with microphone (not included)
Totale is compltely web based. All you need is a web browser to use it on a computer. It does have apps for both Androids and iPhone/iPads, but those also connect to the Internet and supplement the web based version.
I think the 12 months begin when you install and activate the program.
Yes I have bought two and both came with straps. Best bag I have ever seen!!
It's one size fits all. I'm 6'3" and I fit without any problems.
I don't think it is gortex and believe it is water proof but I sprayed mine with a waterproofing material just in case. Also, the pack does come with a complete 4 part system. My sleep system had some missing snaps but still usable and the ilbe did not come as a complete system, it did not include the assault pack and hydration bladder, but for the price, it was an awesome deal. Each one of these alone are about that price.
here is all the info you could ever want, straight from the manufacture. http://www.tennierindustries.com/RFI%20Component%20info.pdf
Yes, but the goggles can not be worn. They are only a for appearance.
Delivery time is about 7-15 business days.
I cannot answer as to machine washing, but it hand washes fine. My grandson got comments how cute he looked each time he wore it. Definitely was a great buy.
It is possible , but I am not too sure if it will be safe enough
I don't know for sure, but I'd say probably not. I bought this for my 1yr old and it fit him with only a little room to grow
It is a straight cut..not roomy..I had to return the xlarge..was like a slim fit..
Yes. I love it. Perfect weight for South Louisiana rainy days.
there is no lining; it is simply a shell. However, if you put a turtleneck or something on under it, you will have your softness. When I put it on over a sweater to work outside I found myself getting very warm. It's a great little shell.
it is one size but it is elastic that can be tide to make smaller of even cut and can add to it to make larger. the panels are 13 inches
Just tulle, but very full and well made.
I purchased this for an event and it is an adult size small to medium
Probably a large. I own these shoes, and since they're made over seas, the sizes tend to run a little small.
Hello, I purchased these in size Large for my grandson... his foot measured a little over 9 inches in length.. so, if you wear adult size 12 then I would suggest size X-Large.. they measure about 11 inches. Good Luck!!
Go with the large because these shoe sizes run a little small.
For US men size 6.5-7, size Medium or Large will fit. For women size, you might need to consider one size down.
9-11. I have a four year old and had to purchase a Small. Currently not available on Amazon
i do not have any
Relatively, not quite as skid proof as those socks you get in the hospital, but they are textured and for the most part skid resistant. Hope that helps.
According to the Stompeez web site, she would wear a large. fits teen sizes 5 to 9
No size chart. I just guessed. I bought a medium for daughter who wore an 11/12 at the time. They still fit and she's in a 12.5
no, these are child sizes. a medium fits my 6 year old daughter.
I got medium for a 7 year old and she still has room, but for a14 year old I think I'd go large. I'd rather be a bit big than too small.
Large, per the Stompeez website.
If you are looking for a shoe size 2.5, I would suggest buying a size Large!
I agree. But, there is an "estimated" size chart for the product if you go to the detailed description. The medium fits from child 11 to child 2.
Yes, I believe size is an issue. I am 5' 5" and weigh 135 lbs, SMALL FRAME.. The "medium" I ordered fits well but not loose. I would not want it to fit one bit tighter.Depending on your physical size and your comfort level I think you could go up to a "extra large." Hope this helps. JBM.
This was a medium. One of the reviews said that they ran large, but mine actually ran kind of small.
true to size. our son wears a medium and it fit great
I ordered it in a small.
That's weird. When I bought these shirts, they specified specified size right by the name of the item. For example, "Los Pollos Hermanos shirt- medium" or "Los Pollos Hermanos- small".
The one I purchased was a small for my extra small girlfriend and it fits her perfectly.
Typical men's t-shirt sizing. I am a very normal Medium (5'10", 155) and it fit me fine lengthwise, a little tight in the arms.
Standard men's sizing. I got a M and it fit me (5'10", 160).
No.
Nope. Just mask
It will but it's tight. I shaved it down a little bit to make it more comfortable.
Thanks for your inquiry, you can choose the shipping way, standard: 3-5 days, expedited: 2 days. Hope this can helpful, any questions please freely to contact us----Cosplay_Rim
Looks just as it does in the photo, the only thing found wrong were a few paint defects that were easy to fix.
It ships from US.

I purchased this Vera Bradley bag for my 16 yr old Granddaughter for Christmas and she loved it. YES, it is a Cross Body (for safety) bag. It allows the hands to be free at all times & the bag secure on the shoulder, across the body. She is 5ft 9inch's tall and falls on her hip for easy access. It is a beautiful bag. I believe the bag is around 48"-50" strap and possibly adjustable (I don't recall that part for sure). This was the 2nd Vera Bradley bag I have purchased for her and now she has requested another one for her Birthday. All the teenager's like them as well as women.
10" across. This is a very functional bag. I also have another of this style in a different pattern.
11 inches by 11 inches
It is not too large or too small! My wife uses it for traveling! She says it is the perfect size!
Don't know - gift to my mother
We do not have a backpack in the midnight blues pattern. Thank you for your interest.
not very well. it's pretty large
It is Black. Rivits are bronze/goldish colored.
Yes. I have worn mine a few times...very flexible...I would suggest using a good leather conditioner on it before wearing the first time
We will make it in order for you, but remember pauldrons will make in sheep brown leather, you can order in same existing listing and drop message with order, we will it for you as per your wish.
They are silver
yes, it should but we broke a strap during the first wear.
I'm not exactly sure with out a caliper. but I think its around 7/8oz
no it does not
I wouldn't recommend it for her, because it snags pretty easily. As my husband said, "It's no Carhartt".
I'm a transplant to WI and we had (I'm told) a particularly brutal winter this year. This was my go-to coat almost every day, and it was great. The thumb holes were fabulous for keeping the cuffs tucked inside my gloves and the zippered pockets were much appreciated for keeping my phone safe. Note that I did not engage in outdoor activities (e.g. sledding, snowshoeing); the coat would be too long and unwieldy for those, and the material is def thin enough that it might tear. Plan to get a size large enough to layer sweaters underneath.
Yes
The arm length is great in this coat, however the rest of the coat runs small. I'm 5'5/130 lbs and bought a size medium. I'm kicking myself that I didn't get the large just because it has a fitted style and it's hard to wear a sweatshirt under this coat. I would recommend going true to size or larger!
Not as warm but if you put on a sweater and undershirt it will keep you nicely. If you are outside alot in 20 degree weather you would need to put on an extra layer for sure. I bought a polar fleece hood that I wear with my coat and if I have that on I am just perfect with warmth. the hood is really just a wind, snow and rain blocker. My other down coat had a very warm hood and I did miss that warmth, but when I started wearing the fleece hood I know longer missed it and I could see more easily.
34 "
I noticed that when I wear clothes made out of natural material - I don't sweat. But if the materials are artificial and I wear too much clothes I sweat.
The zipper goes up to the chin, so it stays on...but I don't know if I'd say "securely." If there is a lot of wind, i kind of blows up...but not off (if fully zipped up).
Depends how warm blooded you are and how you layer and where you live.
It is really more blue. I get so many compliments on the color.

The zipper goes up to the chin, so it stays on...but I don't know if I'd say "securely." If there is a lot of wind, i kind of blows up...but not off (if fully zipped up).
Depends how warm blooded you are and how you layer and where you live.
It is really more blue. I get so many compliments on the color.
I wouldn't recommend it for her, because it snags pretty easily. As my husband said, "It's no Carhartt".
I'm a transplant to WI and we had (I'm told) a particularly brutal winter this year. This was my go-to coat almost every day, and it was great. The thumb holes were fabulous for keeping the cuffs tucked inside my gloves and the zippered pockets were much appreciated for keeping my phone safe. Note that I did not engage in outdoor activities (e.g. sledding, snowshoeing); the coat would be too long and unwieldy for those, and the material is def thin enough that it might tear. Plan to get a size large enough to layer sweaters underneath.
Yes
The arm length is great in this coat, however the rest of the coat runs small. I'm 5'5/130 lbs and bought a size medium. I'm kicking myself that I didn't get the large just because it has a fitted style and it's hard to wear a sweatshirt under this coat. I would recommend going true to size or larger!
Not as warm but if you put on a sweater and undershirt it will keep you nicely. If you are outside alot in 20 degree weather you would need to put on an extra layer for sure. I bought a polar fleece hood that I wear with my coat and if I have that on I am just perfect with warmth. the hood is really just a wind, snow and rain blocker. My other down coat had a very warm hood and I did miss that warmth, but when I started wearing the fleece hood I know longer missed it and I could see more easily.

Yes, the pockets do have zippers. You have to be careful with them though. I got it for my wife and when she opened the zipper it came off the track. A little maneuvering and it will go right back in. That's only from a small thread coming loose.
There is no collar. It comes with the hood attached. It will lay down much like a hoodie.
It is windproof and I'd say water resistant.
No, I don't think so. If you wanted to wash it, I would take it to the dry cleaners.
I think is US sizing. I wear size 14 or 16 depend on the fit. I purchased xl

It folds down to 9.5 inches.
No. . You have to manually open and close the umbrella
Very small. I put one in my rain jacket pocket.
not that great
Yes. I ordered a large for my son and they were equivalent to a 10-12 in boys.
I understand that the fabric gives protection.
Look on the Under Armour Website https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/boys-heatgear-boxerjock-2-pack/pid1241922-004. My grandson is 12 and wears size YLG and loves these underwear. After wearing/washing for a year, they look new. He highly recommends these. He is getting additional set for Christmas.

I googled under armour size charts. A med. is a 10-12, a large is 14-16 and extra large is 18-20. http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/size-charts
Actually, a large may be a little better. Gives a little more room. The medium fits well for my daughter but she is a very small build. My daughter loves this sweatshirt.
I got my granddaughters both a youth size large. I would say that the large is a 10 to 12. It's a little big on the younger of the two but it fits the older one perfectly and I think she wears a 10 in a girls top. I got them both the same size and the younger one wears hers even if it is a little big.
My daughter is size six. I ordered a medium and it ran a little big but I'm glad I didn't order the small.
I would go with an XL Girls or SM Womens size.
This fit my 11 yr old granddaughter just fine.
Youth large
hi I am purchasing for a girl size 9 jr what size would she be in the hoodie, pants, shirts.
I just had my daughter at the under armour store and had her try on different sizes. The adult small fit like the child xl
I have no idea. But if it doesn't fit underarm our does exchanges. But I I had to guess probably a girls medium.

Actually, a large may be a little better. Gives a little more room. The medium fits well for my daughter but she is a very small build. My daughter loves this sweatshirt.
I got my granddaughters both a youth size large. I would say that the large is a 10 to 12. It's a little big on the younger of the two but it fits the older one perfectly and I think she wears a 10 in a girls top. I got them both the same size and the younger one wears hers even if it is a little big.
My daughter is size six. I ordered a medium and it ran a little big but I'm glad I didn't order the small.
I would go with an XL Girls or SM Womens size.
This fit my 11 yr old granddaughter just fine.

Size meets American standards!
no it does not have a drawstring on the bottom
Yes
I suppose that would depend on what you have on under it. I live in East Tennessee, and the coat is actually too warm for our normal winter days. But, with our high humidity and wind, I would have to have on long underwear, a heavy shirt, tee shirt, and perhaps insulated overalls, and then the coat would be great. But to tell you for sure, I cannot. We stay between 20 and 50 most of the winter.
The jacket is made of a very soft outer material, and does not appear to be extremely tough. It is lightweight, does not feel heavy, although the jacket is very warm. The lining is visible on the inside as shinny panels. I have a cheaper Down Jacket that I purchased at Sam's years ago that is similar, although it is more comfortable. I never get too hot in that jacket, and I never get cold in our East Tennessee Winters. This Columbia Jacket will probably be warmer and especially useful in colder climates. Wearing it inside only so far, I got hot in a hurry! I also purchased a Carhart Down Jacket that does have a shell made of a much tougher material, but not quite as rough or coarse as the normal Carhart jacket. The Columbia one has a lot of nice features, and I think that I am going to like it.
I live in the midwest and have worn this coat into temps down to -10, -25 with the wind chill. Without wind, keeping lightly active (walking my dogs), wearing layers beneath it, and staying out of the direct wind, I have been kept comfortably warm. If you are more active (skiing or snowshoeing) you should stay quite warm. The jacket does not block wind very well, so if you are in windy conditions I do not think it would be enough unless you wore some sort of windbreaker over it, but I'm not sure about trying to fit it under something else. I have worn a thick wool sweater under it without any problems.

If you are more active (skiing or snowshoeing) you should stay quite warm. The jacket does not block wind very well, so if you are in windy conditions I do not think it would be enough unless you wore some sort of windbreaker over it, but I'm not sure about trying to fit it under something else. I have worn a thick wool sweater under it without any problems.
Size meets American standards!
no it does not have a drawstring on the bottom
Yes
I suppose that would depend on what you have on under it. I live in East Tennessee, and the coat is actually too warm for our normal winter days. But, with our high humidity and wind, I would have to have on long underwear, a heavy shirt, tee shirt, and perhaps insulated overalls, and then the coat would be great. But to tell you for sure, I cannot. We stay between 20 and 50 most of the winter.
The jacket is made of a very soft outer material, and does not appear to be extremely tough. It is lightweight, does not feel heavy, although the jacket is very warm. The lining is visible on the inside as shinny panels. I have a cheaper Down Jacket that I purchased at Sam's years ago that is similar, although it is more comfortable. I never get too hot in that jacket, and I never get cold in our East Tennessee Winters. This Columbia Jacket will probably be warmer and especially useful in colder climates. Wearing it inside only so far, I got hot in a hurry! I also purchased a Carhart Down Jacket that does have a shell made of a much tougher material, but not quite as rough or coarse as the normal Carhart jacket. The Columbia one has a lot of nice features, and I think that I am going to like it.

i bought 2 of these, 1 was a med for my 9 year old, 1 was a xxs for my 4 year old, the sleeves are a bit long on the xxs but other whys fits great, if you want 2 years use and your child is more on the 6/7 size i would go with the small!!
Probably best to go to Columbia's site and get the kids sizing chart there.
Hi I purchased a medium for my daughter she is 11 but very small so she where's about 8-9 pants and 10 shirt. The jacket is a little large but I wanted it that way as the sleeves are banded so you can pull them in. As I want her to get a bit of wear out of it. I would say the jacket would be more a 10 fitting. If your child is an 8 are they big or small? Do you want growing room? I love the jacket it was just what I wanted, I purchased the Large for my son and he wears a 12 pant and 12-14 shirt the jacket also has just enough growing room. I hope I have helped you with your sizing&#128522;
My daughter has this coat and the main color is red but it has purple plaid.

I would assume it's a knockoff. The tag did not have a Riot logo or anything like that, and the price point is far below what an official product would have. That said, they are well made and you can't beat the cost--particularly if, like me, you can't go to conventions.
It looks exactly like the one in the picture.
I have a pretty big head and it fits snugly.
yeah i think so, it kinda stretches to any size
I purchased a medium.I am 5`3 and about 145pcs.Jacket fits well,the only thing it is a tight fit around the bottom.To zipper it I to pull it up and then pull it back down.I do like the fit,it's very comfortable.I would watch the waistline,if that's an issue.
The jacket fit fine,it was a little tight at the bottom when it came to zippering it.I had lift the jacket up to pull the zipper.but that was done it felt fine.For the money I felt it ed worth it
Yes it is. I am a 16w and this product fit perfect

Beverly, a medium Injini sock covers sizes 8-10.5. Go with a large so the sock is not stretched thin. Save stress on the threads. I promise comfort either way.
I is just one pair for $12.00
Why not? They come in all different sizes, lengths, colors. They retain their elasticity through many washings.
Go to the injinji site http://www.injinji.com/ and check out the sizing guide
One package equals one pair.
Get the next size up, as they run tight, and will shrink alittle.
Definitely go with large. They also have a tendency to shrink a bit in the wash, so you will be good to go.
Yes. I machine dry with out any problems.
Haven't fallen apart yet. I use them on the daily
They are about the same height as the abck of my New Balance running shoes. Haven't worn them long enough to know if the roll down after prolonged use.
I bought size M for this sock, and I run in a size 41, so I would have to imagine that a L would work...socks are great
you can wear them in regular shoes, too. Cuts down on the chance of developing blisters when running.
You should be fine with the Medium size if that's what you normally wear. I personally have purchased over a dozen pairs over the past few years and have never experienced any noticeable shrinking.
In my experience, machine washing is just fine.
I think you would need a Large.
It is a single pair, pretty pricey but they are comfortable and made well, will probably but again

If you are asking about the liners, YES definitly. I wear them under my hiking socks during hiking, under regular socks or even alone as dress socks. They are AWESOME!
just one
I don't know what the "2.0" stands for as there was nothing on the packaging when I received my toe socks. I am not even sure what the 2x stands for unless you ordered 2 pair. When I ordered 3 pairs, I know that I only received 3 pairs of socks. Also, keep in mind that these are considered liner socks. When I wear boots, I wear then under a pair of hiking socks, but when I wear my hiking sneakers, I only wear these liner socks.

One pair....they are worth every cent. Hubby used to get horrible blisters..not one since wearing them. They do make a cool max for the summer months.
There is a lot of helpful info on their site. Here is the sizing portion: http://www.injinji.com/sizing-guide/
No. The only benefit is that they keep the toes separated and wick away moisture. That's what I needed and they were great for that.

It is a single pair, pretty pricey but they are comfortable and made well, will probably but again
One pair....they are worth every cent. Hubby used to get horrible blisters..not one since wearing them. They do make a cool max for the summer months.
There is a lot of helpful info on their site. Here is the sizing portion: http://www.injinji.com/sizing-guide/
No. The only benefit is that they keep the toes separated and wick away moisture. That's what I needed and they were great for that.
medium
Yes.
Beverly, a medium Injini sock covers sizes 8-10.5. Go with a large so the sock is not stretched thin. Save stress on the threads. I promise comfort either way.
I is just one pair for $12.00
Why not? They come in all different sizes, lengths, colors. They retain their elasticity through many washings.
Go to the injinji site http://www.injinji.com/ and check out the sizing guide
One package equals one pair.
Get the next size up, as they run tight, and will shrink alittle.

medium
Yes.
Definitely go with large. They also have a tendency to shrink a bit in the wash, so you will be good to go.
Yes. I machine dry with out any problems.
Haven't fallen apart yet. I use them on the daily
They are about the same height as the abck of my New Balance running shoes. Haven't worn them long enough to know if the roll down after prolonged use.
I bought size M for this sock, and I run in a size 41, so I would have to imagine that a L would work...socks are great
you can wear them in regular shoes, too. Cuts down on the chance of developing blisters when running.
You should be fine with the Medium size if that's what you normally wear. I personally have purchased over a dozen pairs over the past few years and have never experienced any noticeable shrinking.

I have not measured it, but I flew internationally with both pieces and did not have any issues with the dimensions at check-in. It seems similar enough in size to other suitcases that it did not raise any questions with the airline agents. The smaller one is small enough to use as a carry-on roll away.
Not exactly sure but it is very light. Also Sturdy-Living out of the suitcase for over month-no problems at all
The product with the package are weighted 24lb.

I'm a 34x32 and the large fits me well, maybe a bit long but not to bad. I would guess xl, hope it helps
I think the pants have a 32 inch inseam so they may be a little short. Make sure you double check on the UA website. Otherwise, I would suggest a M. I am 36x32 (trying to get back to a 34 :-) )and got a large. They run a little big.
I wear a 32 x 32 in jeans. I am 5'11", i went with a large. They fit good, not to long with the shoes on. I like a little bit of a break in the legs of my pants. They would drag on the ground a bit without my shoes on. Washed and dryed them twice now. Mostly synthetic material, i havent noticed any shrinkage.
They are not lined..so no. However, in our New Mexico weather of 66 to 80 degrees..yes.
My husband is that size and I ordered him a size large.
medium
You may want to try a size large.
tall extra large - xlt
They are truly relax fit, so you should be O.K, unless you have big quads, then go up a size

Thinner. Read my review. It's basically see-thru it's so light. Provides almost no warmth. It's basically for looks.
No. The sleeves are long but the length of the shirt barely reaches my waist. I'm only 6 foot tall.
I'm 6' 180 and I wear a medium. Length is good and fit is fairly slim.
That's a tough question for me only because the one I bought it for is 6'2". I will say it is made shorter on the torso length than expected because it almost is on the verge of appearing too short. It may be a perfect fit for 5'6". Wish I could help more.
Small
This item is a loose fit garment - I am 6'1" 225 - the XL fits loosely if I'm wearing only a tee shirt under - I also own / wear a 2XL over bulkier (golf / polo) shirts and it fits loosely - What will you wear under? I suggest that you go with 2XL if you'll only wear a Tee shirt under..
He wants you to buy the shirt. now!
This is a pretty cheap price for Under Armour items.

I'm 6' 180 and I wear a medium. Length is good and fit is fairly slim.
That's a tough question for me only because the one I bought it for is 6'2". I will say it is made shorter on the torso length than expected because it almost is on the verge of appearing too short. It may be a perfect fit for 5'6". Wish I could help more.

This item is a loose fit garment - I am 6'1" 225 - the XL fits loosely if I'm wearing only a tee shirt under - I also own / wear a 2XL over bulkier (golf / polo) shirts and it fits loosely - What will you wear under? I suggest that you go with 2XL if you'll only wear a Tee shirt under..
He wants you to buy the shirt. now!
This is a pretty cheap price for Under Armour items.
I would call it a loose fit

No, but I did see some cool spiderman sock at target the other day for children
I wear a men's size 13 and they fit me perfectly so I would probably say they might be a little too big for a pre-schoolers.
Yes they would fit very well
I sent them to my son in law who is a surgeon and in Afghanistan. He and all the others l
No. I oredered it as is (im a man size small) and it was way to tight to fit over my chest. It might fit you perfect tho seeing as im a female. :)
I am a 3x and it does not fit over my shoulders. 2x its tight and 1x/smaller it fits nicely if you are a M/L then its going to be like a dress on you. Make sure to measure your chest to see it only fits a 48, i did not read this or do this and im a 52.
Yes, it will fit you. I bought it for my son who is 13 and there is room to spare.
Maybe. Im 6'2 with a 46" chest and could fit. Not sure your chest size
butted
I don't have this product but i can tell you that Chain Mail is best suited to deal with slashes, not so much piercing. if push came to shiv i'm shore it will help you more than just your skin.
We weighed ours at about 18 pounds. Didn't really hamper movement.
I am not sure, but over all I would not buy this shirt again. I first time I wore it the shirt was fine, but after a few weeks the butted rings started falling off due to the shirts own weight. Considering I just walked around with it a few times, show how cheap these were made. This shirt is for decoration only.
Non-riveted steel chainmail long-shirt and coif
I just looked at them and no they don't.
They have the ribbing in the centre of them.
Seems to be all cotton. Moisture wicking toe area does keep my hubby's feet relatively dry. Bought these because the toe socks were causing athletes feet holding moisture in. So far, these socks are working. Comfortable and constructed very well.
No
Yes
Yes
Cotton
These are very small, thin socks. My daughter was not too happy with them. After you wash them, they shrink even more. So they didn't go very high on her leg, and they are quite thin. Also took about a month or more to get.
6 pairs
Socks are not labeled L or R
Good question. If so, it is not advertised as such. I checked mine andt he entire interior surface appears to be sealed. The exterior is rip-stop style material and will hold water, but the interior barrier will keep contents dry. Amazon also sells an Osprey Raincover accessory that fits this pack (xs size) for $15.
Not readily no, but it is possible. It is however made to attach to the outside of full sized Osprey packs, so perhaps your pack will work as well.
Yep! here's a picture of it looking pretty snug inside the Osprey porter 46. http://i.imgur.com/LXZsylO.jpg The porter also contained a packing folder and a packing cube underneath.
Yes, there are two large water bottle pockets on the outside :)
Yes. My Macbook pro 13" fits in the main compartment easily. It will not fit in the pouch on the inside of the main compartment however, its too narrow of a space. There is no padded laptop compartment, it would just be in the bag unprotected. Hope this helps
I don't have any problem with Daylite and feel very comfortable with it. I think I am the same gender as your husband.
I think so but it would be very tight. I returned this backpack immediately as it was very small.
It's a well-made, sturdy pack. So I believe it could hold all of those items. You may want to consider reinforcing the bottom with foam padding due to the weight of the dumbbells.
I think the size would limit you before you hit what it could carry. But between the frame, waist strap, chest strap, and well designed/attached shoulder straps, you could probably comfortably balance a 15 lb load.
I ride with mine and it is very comfortable. I do sometimes not fasten the chest strap because it can "ride" up and get a little irritating. Hope this helps.

hello sir, we have several color of the mask. They are, sliver/bronze/army/diy(no pained), you can make your favourite color in the diy version by yourself. Any orther question, pls just let me know. By the way. We have stock in hand which means we can arrange the bane mask for you immediately .Welcome to place order with us.
No way... Tight fit!
For this particular mask I believe it is one size only, and I'm an adult, mid 20's and it fits me perfect. I'm also a bigger guy and it's a good fit. For children and skinnier guys it may not fit as well.
It doesn't. U gotta order that separate
Hi Jennifer, the Item is shipped from amazon warehouse, it will took 3-7 days by USPS , or 2-3 days by UPS. Welcome to place order,enjoy the mask.
I bought the bane mask a few months ago and it fits me pretty well although I have a medium sized head I had to take a razor blade to smooth out the edges to keep them from cutting into my scalp.
Yes it will
I'm not really sure... I have a pretty big head and it fit just fine.. Love the mask
No
My head measures 23 1/4" and it fit me perfect. Hope this helps!
I'm 5'11" with a 33" waist. The XL fits me well.
I am 6' 1' and 212 lbs, 38WX34L. XXXL fit snuggly around my waist with perfect length. I think the XXXL length would be too long for you. You might consider XXL instead.
Ridden in the teens with these. They are very wind proof and usually I wear a pair of tights under them and they are warm and toasty. My feet are the problem! Remember to order Very Big. I am 32" waist, 160# & 5'-11"+ and XXL worked for me.
Xxl is your best bet
There is a thin layer of padding, but not a full chamois. I'm not a runner, but I don't think these pants are suited for that purpose. They're loaded with padding down the front of the leg, which is good when cycling (due to wind) but could be restrictive for a runner.
Definitely China
I'd say you were borderline. I am 5'8" 215# with a bit of a pot belly - the XXL is snug at my waist but still comfortable because the material on the back side is stretchy. The XXL is maybe an inch or two too long but that's OK on a bike. If you go with the XXXL you should be fine in the length and probably the waist also. The sizing sucks but other than that they are a fantastic piece of cycling clothing. A real value.
No, zipper bottom ankles help slip on but overall a loose fit NOT SKIN TIGHT. My son and I felt no tightness, though we are both slim.
By using the chart that was provided I ordered a XL. I then received a e-mail from the seller asking my weight and height. I responded with "My height is 5ft 11.5 inches weight 175 lbs". They sent this back to me the next morning. "Thanks for your quick respond,we do think size XL will be a little short for you,size XXL will be ok". They were correct the pants fit perfect. So I would go one size larger than what the chart reccomends.
I am 6' and about 190-200lbs. My waist is 32-34" with a 36" inseam. I got the XXL and I'm pretty happy. They could use another 0.5-1" in length, maybe, and I would be ok if they were a little less snug in the legs (but I usually have to get relaxed fit jeans). You would probably be ok with XXL or even XXXL.

The XXL is maybe an inch or two too long but that's OK on a bike. If you go with the XXXL you should be fine in the length and probably the waist also. The sizing sucks but other than that they are a fantastic piece of cycling clothing. A real value.
No, zipper bottom ankles help slip on but overall a loose fit NOT SKIN TIGHT. My son and I felt no tightness, though we are both slim.
By using the chart that was provided I ordered a XL. I then received a e-mail from the seller asking my weight and height. I responded with "My height is 5ft 11.5 inches weight 175 lbs". They sent this back to me the next morning. "Thanks for your quick respond,we do think size XL will be a little short for you,size XXL will be ok". They were correct the pants fit perfect. So I would go one size larger than what the chart reccomends.
I am 6' and about 190-200lbs. My waist is 32-34" with a 36" inseam. I got the XXL and I'm pretty happy. They could use another 0.5-1" in length, maybe, and I would be ok if they were a little less snug in the legs (but I usually have to get relaxed fit jeans). You would probably be ok with XXL or even XXXL.
I'm 5'11" with a 33" waist. The XL fits me well.
I am 6' 1' and 212 lbs, 38WX34L. XXXL fit snuggly around my waist with perfect length. I think the XXXL length would be too long for you. You might consider XXL instead.
Ridden in the teens with these. They are very wind proof and usually I wear a pair of tights under them and they are warm and toasty. My feet are the problem! Remember to order Very Big. I am 32" waist, 160# & 5'-11"+ and XXL worked for me.
Xxl is your best bet
There is a thin layer of padding, but not a full chamois. I'm not a runner, but I don't think these pants are suited for that purpose. They're loaded with padding down the front of the leg, which is good when cycling (due to wind) but could be restrictive for a runner.

It slides on it doesn't clip on. Similar to a bobby pin.
That is great thinking! I would love to know the answer as well.
Order two of them, then press contact seller. Or click on the seller's name and click contact seller. You then choose a topic and type an email saying which you'd like.
Since one is .99, 2 will be $1.98
not really.... it would just remain emptier....

Yes, you can fold the front cover completely back on itself.
I think it would fit, it may not close all the way. I think it would be close though.
I have a smaller note pad 1/4" but I could probABLY GO TO 1/2" OR MAYBE 3/4" but I don't know about a full 1"...
Yes
Yes it is, assuming you use the 8.5 by 11 inch paper, which is standard in the US.
Yes. It has just the right amount of stretch to it. But it's sturdy!
I agree with Brian. No instructions but I liked it the way it was.
I have a small head, about 7 and a 3/8. The mask fits perfectly. It's not loose, but not too tight either. I think for anyone with a more normal sized head it may possible be a little more tight. The material is a harder type of substance and not as flexible as the cheaper $20 mask a lot of people bought last year. However, it is very thick and doesn't seem like it will break.
Yes,of course,we ship to canada.
I am an adult and these are my watches.
I have no idea. I will take mine to a battery shop when the time comes.
My daughter is 13 with a tiny wrist. I am much older with a tiny wrist. They work. They can be applied a little further up the arm also and they don't slide down.
Pink
A small should be fine.My sisters 13 and wears a small.
Fitted
It depends on the fit you want. I bought a medium for my sister and she is a size 5. It fits her a little loose which is how she wanted it. I love this hoodie and have one in every color!

I bought it for a 5 year old and it wasn't a one size fits all. It does have those adjustment straps that are the same as snap backs on baseball hats. I wouldn't recommend it for under 5. The boy's 3 year old brother loves it, but even at the tightest it goes, he still has to hold it on. It probably wouldn't fit a full grown adult comfortably.
Only English.
It says something like: Sir Power levels are criticall; Weapons activaded; Target locked on;Target aquired; Target engaged, Target destroyed; Flight systems activaded, maximum power level,Sir select weapons, Iron man systems engaged, target neutralized.
Yes. It is just like the picture.
There are 2 adjustable straps and is able to fit my 2 ur old and a 10 year old. Great product all then way around!
No, a sports bra is definitely a necessity
Might be a little short . I'm only 5'4 so long enough for me . It snags easily .
I wear black yoga pants with this shirt. If you are asking if they come with pants, they do not. Hope this helps!
I would say loose, but not baggy. That is only if you are ordering the appropriate size, in which case it could go either way. It's form fitting without hanging off of you or being skin tight.
It lasts a good few days. The way i use it personally is every Monday I will spray my boots then if I need to, I will spray them one more time in the middle of the week. that usually does the trick for until next Monday. It is not a once and done fix, I doubt one exists.
Yes. First product for smelly feet I have tried that really works. Buy it!
In would assume so, as it is a spray
I would say about 5 weeks if you use it daily for your feet, and a little bit longer if you use it just to spray inside shoes because. You don't really need a lot of the spray.
It did for me! I had a few pairs of sweat-drenched shoes that I thought might have to be trashed. This shoe/foot deodorant really helped save my feet and shoes! Hope that helps. :-)
I'm not an umpire or sports official, but I (and my family) work out a lot and participate in many sports...We found this spry to not help too much with the "bad foot smell" but more add a strong splash of a minty smell. For sweaty, stinky feet I truthfully wouldn't recommend this product. Hope this helps some!
Personally i dont own leather loafers but i do have some shoes that have leather soles inside and it still seems to work idk if itll do damage to yours but mine seem the same since the week or 2 that ive used the spray

Yes, it comes with 1 one-hitter cigarette pipe and 1 dugout.
Yes, it is. Simply visit our store front and select the black unit, or search for composite cigarette case, and then select black from the search results.
the spring sucks and you can smell it right through your pocket stay away if you're looking for something covert
Aluminum
Its metal and it looks like a cigarette
metallic
Yes it does. The wire is so springy that I find it hard to fold it all the way up. The crown is soft, so the hat doesn't take up much space even when the wire is unfolded. Hope that helps.
I haven't worn the hat - it is VERY light, more flimsy than I thought, but probably good in a pinch - I got it for an "emergency" kit so I can't comment on the strap since I have not worn it.
don't matter what size is...It will fit.....I personally don't like it because the rims are turn upward which means this hat don't keep sun out from face...." its a beautifully traveling hat"
The tag reads thus: Perfect for traveling, water repellent, UV protection, cool mesh, washable "in sack", retains original shape, Aussie style. Sorry, no mention of UB protection.
Our 3 year old plays with it. She can lift it and roll it with no problems.
We don't make up names, it's industry standard that this piece of backpack be called as rolling backpack. Backpack generally speaking has straps on the back that you can carry on your back, that's why the term "back pack".
Yes two straps it can roll and pick up to carry
In settings you can adjust the placement of the time vs HRM, depending on the activity.
Yes, you have to wear it. I send mine back because I wasn't happy with it. It didn't work well. Maybe it was a Monday version.
Did not like unit, only used once
No it is permanently connected.
Yes
I dont understood your question well but, when you save the session then you can see average hr the lowest and your high hr as a result
The watch has a 100-Hour Chronograph with Lap and Split Times and 200-Lap Memory. Check timex.com, the watch manuals are available in pdf.
Yes
Yes
No
No, there is a constant reading setting. The red button starts and stops the timer and zone alarm.
Strap is about 40-41 inches long before stretching. The strap stretches quite a bit, but I can not speak on comfort at that range.
Don't know. Only use the watch...but it works great....rate it 5 stars
Only time I had trouble I didn't use gel.
Thank you for your interest in ordering with us. The chest strap that comes with the Timex T5K736 is one size, however it is adjustable to fit as needed.
It counts calories real time
The belt monitor is water resistant from the factory according to the manual; however once the battery has been changed new seals have to be installed for the monitor to maintain its water resistant qualities. The manual is sort of iffy in terms of it being water proof. In terms of swimming and having the monitor transmit heart rate information, it won't transmit under water and the instructions plainly states that. I think a monitor has to be analogue to transmit cardio info, this is digital. You can download the manual by googling Timex Men's T5K736 Zone Trainer Digital
I don't see why not, it's not big and bulky
Jason P. You can set only one target hr zone,
Yes, the time and heart beat is visible.

My daughter is 30 pounds and it fits her perfectly. It's roomy so she will get a great deal of usage from it but not so much room it's unsafe.
My boy is in 12-18mos and I bought a small. It is a tad small on him, so for 2t I would probably say xl.
I would say the biggest size. However I don't think this is appropriate for a 6yr old. I would recommend this for 2-3 yr olds
I would get a 3T. It fits super tight And when they sit down the padding rides up. My son is 36 inches as well and 34.5 pounds. He is 21 months. The 2T was way to tight.
Is One piece and sucks!!
My LO is only 21lbs at 17 months. I think it is up to 33 lbs, but it is tight fitting. It does ride up into his chin so I have to constantly pull it down. It is really made for kids old enough to understand how to swim but does not yet have the ability. We just like the extra security in case he slips in the pool from our arms.

I would get a 3T. It fits super tight And when they sit down the padding rides up. My son is 36 inches as well and 34.5 pounds. He is 21 months. The 2T was way to tight.
Is One piece and sucks!!
My LO is only 21lbs at 17 months. I think it is up to 33 lbs, but it is tight fitting. It does ride up into his chin so I have to constantly pull it down. It is really made for kids old enough to understand how to swim but does not yet have the ability. We just like the extra security in case he slips in the pool from our arms.
From Speedo's website SIZING: SMALL | 1-2 Years | 33lbs. (15kg) MEDIUM | 2-4 Years | 33-45lbs (15-20kg) LARGE | 4-6 Years | 45-50lbs (20-27kg)
My little one is in 3t. I purchased a medium and there was still a little room to grow.
Yes. Just like a regular backpack.
yes... both sides ..
fits regular size folders, my daughter uses it for kindergarten and is the perfect size
Leash cord is not included... I have yet to have the need for one... They fit snug and don't move..I am a firefighter and have worn them in various situations and they've never fallen... Yes a cleaning cloth is incuded along with a case
Black
One set of lenses are included in the package.
Yes, they are polarized. I don't even consider buying non polarized lenses any more. Great glasses!
Yes. I tried the same ones on at my eye dr. office and they look and feel the same, same markings, come in the same box with the same kit. I didn't see the notice about "no warranty if bought from amazon" before I bought them, but I don't think it would have detered me and it wouldn't deter me now that I own them either. I don't have problems taking care of my glasses, especially when they cost more than $15. These are the real thing and I would recomend buying them from Amazon based on the price. I bought them for riding my Harley and they work great.
Yes, On the upper back in black lettering.
No this one is just a regular shirt, no commercial insignia whatsoever.
I'm 5'8 and ordered a standard LRG iy fits great. So you might want to opt for the med or small depending on the rest of your mesurements. Hopes this helps.
Nope. Most shirts would but this one kept its shape no matter what. I love it. Enjoy. I'm a large and picked a large and it fits great.
It would fit her a bit loose I got the large she might want to get the med
The sleeves will be too long for a girl, I suppose and the fabric looks too much casual for a girl, I wouldn't recommend.
Yes, our Blood Life logo is screen printed on the back, below the neck line.

Depends on the shoes...winter shoes will fit one in each sleeve. I fit both sandals last summer in each sleeve.
yes, it is very sturdy. it has thick canvas. It is almost like a mini suitcase for your shoes. I think it would work well for your car traveling purpose.
These bags are pretty roomy and have soft sides that can expand, so I think a large shoe would fit. You would probably be able to put on one per pocket which means a total of 4 pairs in one bag. Hope this helps!
No. I was somewhat disappointed with this product, as I was buying it for someone who wears a size 11 1/2. The sneakers or shoes would fit.
glass, its awesome uy it
Each section: Width: 2.3" / Long: 3.9" - The Box Width: 10.1" - Long: 7.8"
Yes it does I have 2 guess and 5 fossil and they all fit perfect
As a woman, I use it for my watch necklaces, pocket watches and wrist watches. It works fine for me and I love it!
The dividers can not be removed really but the little cushions for the watches are all removable. This is a functional and a sturdy box. The quality is good and I find it convenient. I have a few big dial watches and they all fit great. Enough space. Would recommend. Thanks!
I don't think they will fit, his biggest watch is 48mm, and that is about as big of a watch that it will hold.
I think you can use it for pocket watches if you remove the cushioned sections between each watch.
No, this is NOT a music box. Amazon has probably mistakenly put the note. It is a beautiful, well made and functional item but it doe not play any kind of music. Hope this helps.
Black
About 1 and a half inches wide. You can't use it with today's huge watches.
No but it is water resistant so don't go in the pool with it!
SET TIME-(from the manual)- hold b(lower) button for 2 seconds, press a to change the hours, then press b to switch to minutes, use a to change, and so on. As for reading it, you count as you would binary- for the time, you add up all the red lit up numbers for the hour, and all the blue ones for the minute. With date, you hit a on the time, and then blue is the month and red is the day. It definitely takes awhile to get used to, but in a week or so you'll be able to add the time in your head even without the numbers.
You have to remove the back of the watch and locate the battery and replace it. Locating the battery isn't hard, it's the first thing you see when you open it.
Yes, yes they are. But in very choppy English. You'll still be able to understand how to program it though.
Yes it had the miku on the watch for me and it also comes in a sexy miku box ^^
Good question. Had to go measure. It is the width of the lock body. From the bottom of the lock to the top of the curve of the lock armature is approx. 40 mm. Hope the helps.
Website says 2mm which Google says is about 1/6 of an inch
4 keys
007
From the inside of the loop to the base of the lock is exactly 15 m.m. that is the clearance you need to have 1 inch is 25.4 mm. Is enough for an average medium suitcase. Don't know about about rifle cases. But I think you should get a heavy duty lock this one is not strong at all. DS. Good luck
The inside from curve to the top of brass body is 5/8 inch. The width is 1/2".
These locks come with tiny keys that open them. The combination lock would require you to manipulate the lock to the correct combination. I chose these because they are TSa approved and they can open the locks themselves if they randomly need to search a bag. It beats having your suitcase cut open. These locks worked great for us.
Did i mention these are lousy? How big is the hole? Kmart sells these, so u can see what they look like. Target has similar locks too.
They come pre keyed. They all use the same key.
There are 4 keys

It's plastic. Quite cheap looking, but my 6 year old son loved it :)
I have a four year old and bought according to size chart, It was very long. The mask is cheap. However for the price I have no complaints. He plays in it alot and is growing into to the lenght.
Dear Customer, Thank you for showing interest in our product. Yes, we do ship to Israel. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us. Thank you. KT AmazonSales Support, SpicyLegs.com
I ordered this for my 4 year old who wears a 4t and it was huge on him. so much so that I had to order a different power ranger costume for halloween. I definitely think the 4-6 is the way to go.
It's just a front mask
Yes. That is the typical size. Bought it for my 5 year old nephew and he has a little room he can grow into which is good!
YES, this is right
No it doesn't :(

It should. My son was wearing the 4-6 around that age. It may be a little big. Give him some room to grow
Most likely. But it will depend on how thick the frames are you can go to target and try on the mask
My wife says it's accurate, she tells me after every run how far she went.
You press and hold the upper button and it takes you to settings
Quite adjustable; I wear a small Fitbit and I could cinch this up nice and tight but it had tons of room to move to accommodate a larger wrist. I bet it would fit my husband.
I've never has that issue personally. The band stays on pretty well and when I have removed it myself it didn't cause any issues when putting back on.
It includes heart rate monitor
As far as I know, no...BUT I just use the light on the watch, then I can see it
There no setting that I saw that would change it.
It has a work out Counter
Yes
It only works for walking, jogging, or running.
Unfortunately, this item has only been produced in sizes Small, Medium and Large.
Medium child size fits slim petite 9 year old. Usually wears medium in regular clothes. This medium runs small.
No, I bought a medium, and it fits my daughter tight, and she is a size 10.
The coordinating wig can be found here: http://www.amazon.com/Monster-High-Skelita-Calaveras-Wig/dp/B00BG347LI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1381501195&sr=8-1&keywords=Monster+High+Skelita+Calaveras+wig
I got my son the medium cause he wears 7-8. I figured he has long legs it would be safe. However he is super skinny so the costume was huge.
My son wore this last year and he was 5t and the small fit perfect it was just a little long.
The size depends on what size clothes your child wears.
I bought a small for my then 5 year old but he's in the 30th percentile. If your child is any buffet, get a bigger size.
I got the small for my son (says fits 44 to 48 in height) and he was in 3T clothes, about 36 inches tall & kinda skinny. He definitely needed the legs shortened. I turned it inside out and pinched the material together in the thighs and stitched it real quick to take ~3 inches out, repeated for the calves. After that, it fit great. This was for Halloween 2013. Over the year, he's grown quite a bit and I just let out some of the stitches and he still wears the costume quite a bit. Seems like a lot of work for a Halloween costume but it really wasn't that hard and it was our only choice. He is still crazy about TMNT, probably going to be Leo this year.
No, only the outfit, shell and mask
I bought it for my 3 year old son and it is just the right size!
I'm guessing probably not. My son is about 50" and the medium is just a couple inches too long for him. I doubt if a large is that much bigger than a medium.
No, it doesn't come with shoes and, unfortunatelly, I don't know where u can get it. Sorry!
Last year my daughter was 7years old and she wear size M.
Unfortunately, we do not ship internationally at this time
Hello and thank you for contacting us. Unfortunately we do not ship orders with Saturday delivery. However, we can not speak for all vendors offering this item.
Yup, text, call, email, notification.
The USB cable is only for charging. You can attach the cable to any device, like a laptop computer or wall adapter to charge it. All updating of the watch is done wirelessly through the bluetooth connection.
No Dick Tracy action here. When a call comes in, that info appears on the Pebble. You can accept/reject the call on the Pebble. But the watch has no microphone, so conversations still require the phone. For iPhone, a search on PEBBLE in the App Store yields relevant apps. They include one which allows you to use the watch to snap pics. Another amazingly provides turn by turn directions, via vibrations as you walk, telling you to turn left or right. The watch will always show the time, regardless of iPhone location. The rest is best explained by example. My chosen watchface/app = Futura, which shows time, Thu Dec 26, 39, and a weather icon (today, sunny & clear). I can move around my house, with the iPhone on another level/floor, risking the loss of only the weather info. Some days, I can roam around floor to floor, without loss of connection to the phone. Other days, I'm not so fortunate. Haven't figured out the precise real-world range yet. In any event, at worst, the icon and temp will disappear. When I'm back in range, that info soon reappears without any assistance on my part. FYI: I invested in a pouch -- which can be worn around the neck, or clipped with the carabiner supplied -- to keep the phone at hand, even when I have no pockets. Search here for neck-strap pouch iphone carabiner for options. Range from $6 to under $30. Some very highly rated. (As a woman, not all my clothing includes pockets. I've since cured that, via men's cargo sweats and the like for around the house. Turns out, they fit great and are of much higher quality that similar women's clothing. Go figure.)
The brighter it is outside, the easier it is to see the watch. In dim lighting, inside or outside, all you have to do is shake your wrist and a backlight will come on making it easy to read.
Yes, you can have both connected at the same time. I do so frequently.
Yes. Fully water proof.
Yes
The steel is all about style. They are the exact same on the inside (hardware, software), but the steel looks a little classier.
I love them both, but the pebble steel looks and feels like a real watch, the regular pebble used to only have 4 app slots and steel had 8 slots but after recent updates they both have 8 slots now. If you can, go for the steel, you won't regret it.
Pebble itself does not have the ability to monitor heart rate. So you'll need a separate heart rate sensor. However, it can interface with apps that DO, like Runkeeper. So basically if you can get the heart rate info on your phone in some way, you should be able to get it on Pebble too with a third party app.

They are a bit snug on the waist. I would go a size up. I am a 32 and went with medium. Should have gone with a large but the medium is wearable.
XL
No
I have a 36 inch waist and the XXL's work for me, loose, but not too baggy. I have two pairs.
I bought these in XXL for a man who is 5' 10" ,240lb and 40 inch waist. The fit is a bit relaxed which he likes. I hope that helps you. He is new to biking and has not tried Pearl Izumi.

Hello, the watch comes pre-loaded with courses (Mexico included) so you don't have to download any maps. But if a new course were to be built than you would need to. Keep in mind that you will have to pay an annual fee to access the maps. It's 20 US dollars a year. If you buy a Garmin watch (do a search for garmin s1) you don't pay for any annual fees. Good luck, I'm sure your husband will be very happy with this gift.
I used the USB that came with the watch and plugged it into my phone charger USB wall adapter
I would say your golf courses are included. I really don't know if the 30,000 + golf courses are listed or not. I would just go to the golf course, turn on the Caddie and for sure that golf course will come up.
Probably 27 holes. There is normally about 25% left after 18. However, I only use the GPS function which works great.
*GO PLAY ACTIVATION is renewable each year for your WATCH, GIMME & AIRE. By renewing each year, you will continue to enjoy NO ANNUAL FEES for the lifetime of your rangefinder. Price: $0.00 (USD)
yes at any jewelery store or department store that carries watch batteries
Only suggestion I have is go into settings and make sure GPS is set to ON.
Sorry for my last reply. Yes, it does have an odometer; I have never used it though.
Yes
I believe the GPS finds whatever courses are nearby. At least that is how it works in the US. Perhaps if you go to the Sky Caddie website, it will have a more complete a answer.
Not too bad. It's is pretty sturdy and a bit larger looking in person.
three fett from one side to the other
72 inches tall 42 inches wide when assembled.
Medium if you're built well. Small if you've got a runners body.
I think I would go for the large, unless he likes them pretty tight.
Hi, if you're looking for a fit exactly like the picture, I suggest Small. However, if you want it a bit loose, try the Medium. It all depends how you want to wear it. *Side note: My son has a few of these, and after several washes, he said the fit isn't as tight as when you first get it. Also, never but it in the dryer to preserve the stretch and to prevent the logo on chest from peeling and cracking! Hope it helps :)
extra large
Then definitely extra large
Those shirts are like a layer of paint. So, it depends
If it's a normal fit and not compression I'd go with XXL. It also depends if he likes his shirts tight fitting. See I do not.
Probably a large or maybe an extra large. These shirts are supposed to fit exetremely tight. I am 5'11" and 185, and wear mediums.
I would say a medium or large depending on how snug you want it to be...my son bought both sizes and I prefer the medium on him but they both fit nice. I bought XXL for my husband (6' 225lbs) when I buy the next one I will get him XL. Hope that helps.

I think I would go for the large, unless he likes them pretty tight.
Hi, if you're looking for a fit exactly like the picture, I suggest Small. However, if you want it a bit loose, try the Medium. It all depends how you want to wear it. *Side note: My son has a few of these, and after several washes, he said the fit isn't as tight as when you first get it. Also, never but it in the dryer to preserve the stretch and to prevent the logo on chest from peeling and cracking! Hope it helps :)
extra large
Then definitely extra large
Those shirts are like a layer of paint. So, it depends
If it's a normal fit and not compression I'd go with XXL. It also depends if he likes his shirts tight fitting. See I do not.
Probably a large or maybe an extra large. These shirts are supposed to fit exetremely tight. I am 5'11" and 185, and wear mediums.
I would say a medium or large depending on how snug you want it to be...my son bought both sizes and I prefer the medium on him but they both fit nice. I bought XXL for my husband (6' 225lbs) when I buy the next one I will get him XL. Hope that helps.

It's 140mm for the whole 'arm'. I measure from the hinge and straight back. It includes the round part over the ear. I hope that helps. It's hard to explain without a picture.
These are not prescription, and do not contain the magnification found in all Gunnar products. So my assumption would be that you would see no effect for near or farsightedness. The yellow lenses filter the blue light which helped my computer-use induced headaches.
Yah hey can be stylish if you got that quirky style. For me I use them solely for gaming and watching movies at home.
Unisex. I'm not sure why they are titled womans because they are normal size. And nothin girlish about them. Buyers note: the memory flex is only for the arms of the glasses. The frame around the lenses are stiff.
Hi, to be completely honest with you the frame is really lightweight. So much so that it gives the impression that it's on the cheap side and will fall off your face because its loose and seems breakable. I bought these because I thought they looked like a good quality similar tp raybans but they unfortunately are not and yes the yellow tint is noticeable but its takes away the computer glare so it needs to be. Hope this helps.
Not 100% sure if they are polarized or not but I can say that they do make my vision clearer and have driven with them on. Vision seems clearer with less glare. Hope this helps.
They could probably be used for it, but they are made for gaming. They have a light yellow tint and makes everything on the screen really vivid. I hope this helps!
The lenses are plastic and offer no magnification.
52 is the width of each lens, 18 is the distance between lenses (the bridge), the last number is the length of the piece that goes from the lens back to the ear, all in mm.
Yes, very well for woman!
The inside tag says China. It says nothing on their website about this. Too bad, it's a well made bag and set up so smartly. Hope this helps.
No, it will not. It has trouble fitting some 15-inch PC Laptops. I would not suggest it for anything larger. Thanks!
It can fit your laptop. My laptop is 15'' macbook retina, and it can be put in this bag.
Yes
No
One or two textbooks are ok.
I carry both my laptop and ipad in it comfortably.
Hi, Forward me the link to the one not having the discount, and i will fix immediately.! Thanks mike KM Camera
It's a dark grey; a very nice color.
I have a 15.4 MacBook Pro with a hard shell case on it and it fits fine.
Sure, no problem. I usually carry my laptop, it's charger, a book and a notebook plus a few minor accesories and it fits just fine; however do not expect much room left for additional stuff. I have had it for about 3 months now and it looks just as new.
That's what I have right now. Fits fine!
Yes, and have room for an iPad
Hi Joyce. The bag outer dimensions are approx 40cm x 35cm x 10cm, the main inner compartment is 38cm x 28cm x 7cm, but this compartment is split into a padded laptop pocket and a slightly larger pocket for notepads etc. There is a front pocket at 38cm x 26cm x 2-3cm. As you can tell from the measurements this is a very slim bag, I use it for a work bag and it doesn't take much more than a laptop, notepad and a couple of bits and bobs, it starts struggling once you throw in a few battery chargers etc. The lid fastens one side with velcro, the other side with a magnet - none of these are very strong, so if you overload the bag the lid has a tendency to open up (there's no internal zip). All in all I my advice would be to look for something larger with bigger pockets and zipped lids. Hope this helps.
My 15.4 in Mac book fit with extra room for my stuffs
I have a 15.4 Mac Pro and it fits like it was made for it. 15.6 might fit but it'd be tight.
I doubt it will protect from dropping or stepping on it.
I'm sure it would considering a 15.4' Macbook Pro fits fine.
Probably not water proof, but could stand a light sprinkling with a laptop in side. If you dropped it in water it would be instantly soaked, but the lining is thick enough I don't have to worry about bringing it through the rain for a little bit. It's like a canvasy type of material.
No
Hi David, Thanks for the question, the bag is actually 37.2 ounces which when converted to pounds equals 2.3 Lbs. Hope that helps :)
No, it cannot be locked
Hi, Thanks for your inquiry! The length of the bag is 29", and the circumference, when closed, is 48". If there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to ask. Thanks, The Gear Out Here Team
Hi, Thanks for your inquiry! Aqua Quest Waterproof Bags are designed for temporary submersion. In the case of the White Water Series, the duration of this submersion would be short. For example, it would, in all likelihood, repel water if dropped off the side of a boat and snatched back up. Depth is another issue. This bag has the capacity to retain a lot of air, which, when underwater, will work to force it's way out, leaving a pathway for water to enter in its place. This force is compounded exponentially as depth increases. If there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to ask. Thanks, The Gear Out Here Team
I wear a size 36 in everything and the WOD Warrior shorts were no different. True to size.
Just a little change pocket inside the waistband
They have a 9-inch inseam, and are very baggy around the knee's. I'm 5-7 and they look very baggy on me.
Hi Paul, I where a 32-33 and purchase a 34 size. They fit great and have a draw string inside. If I got the 32 I was concerned that they would fit to snug. I'm happy with the 34. I purchased two pair. They also give real nicely with crossfit moves. Hope this helps Kind regards Bart
Yes, the vertical portion is Velcro as well as some Velcro at the waistband. There is also a drawstring.

Hi Paul, I where a 32-33 and purchase a 34 size. They fit great and have a draw string inside. If I got the 32 I was concerned that they would fit to snug. I'm happy with the 34. I purchased two pair. They also give real nicely with crossfit moves. Hope this helps Kind regards Bart
Yes, the vertical portion is Velcro as well as some Velcro at the waistband. There is also a drawstring.
I wear a size 36 in everything and the WOD Warrior shorts were no different. True to size.

I am 6"1" and these socks come up to my knees. Reebok makes some good knee highs for women. Hope this helps
No they do not have cushion padding. They are just thick socks.
My husband's go to the knee but not above
It's one size fits all.
One pair comes in a pack. Hope this helps.
No excellent reinforcement
No, no padding, you can use them for other purposes as well....
I'm sure you can spray rain repellent on and it might work. But the Capris itself is already somewhat waterproof. It drys really quick.
I don't think is quite appropriate not elastic enough why don't you try this website for cool yoga pants Hotchakrasyoga.com
Nope! No padding.
Hi! We did. I ordered size L for my husband and we exchanged it for M. He does love the shorts! Good luck!
Yes/No. Yes: They keep me covered temperature wise on my ride to work, but I'm in sunny socal, so the whole climate is wind resistant. It's a thin outdoor/breathable material. No: These are shorts, with a breathable material. Would I use these to bike on a cold Chicago day, maybe, I'm a sweater, so it'd keep me balanced; but once you stop riding/moving around, the punishment would ensue. Hope this helps.
We paid $12.69 per pair. These were special as they match high school football uniforms. Grandsons love them. Ours were packed one pair each. Hope this helps.
Yes, they are good for basketball.
both sides
Under Armour's size chart would say large. But, assuming you're talking men's sizing, I wear the same size as you and I had to return my large Ignite crew socks - just too big (long). The large size is designed by UA as 9 - 12.5 - this is a large range and if you're on the lower end I'd try medium.
Kay, I would stay with a Medium. A large might have problems fitting well in the heal... meaning the sock's heal would be up on the boys Achilles tendon and that would not be comfortable. Good Luck.
My son, 11, wears a men's 7 shoe. The medium socks fit him very well. I hope this helps answer your question.
You can check out Under Armour sock sizes on their website sizing chart. I wear a medium and am an 8 1/2 U.S, so you can probably wear 8 to 9 (approximately).

MenS. Excellent fit and comfort. Wearing them now!
What's your question, Bruce?
Yes I wear a size 12 and they are big enough for 14 or 15. Dry them on a low setting or hang dry and they will be fine.
no- it would be too big actually for him
I would say a Medium. My son wears a men's 7.5 and the medium fits perfect. I think that's about a 9 in women's so that should fit the same - at least for the 9 and 9.5... not sure about the 10.
Medium should work for you. They don't run big.

I don't know what they are rated for as OSHA standards but they work well for riding my motorcycle. They seem pretty durable as far as I have noticed. I have two sets now and both are holding up well.
I am not sure, but, if you still have the paper insert that came in the package there may be a parts order form included.
There is a frame that comes with this that fits inside these glasses that you can have presciption lenses installed in . I tried them to on with insert in and were very comfortable
no. these do not have an ANSI rating.
No! They stay put! Another reason to love them!
You can find them at several online eyeglass lens makers. Try searching for "LensRx".
Hi Marcia...I have the 28" .....It measures 29" with the wheels and handle....It measures 26" without the wheels and handle....I love the size for my UK trip....and I love the quality...very happy with the purchase....Cheers, TJ
Per the literature it states 8.4 lbs. My husband used it once and loved how light it felt. It is the lightest suitcase I have even felt. With the spin wheels it's awesome!
It has a place for you to hook your lock
No
According to the info that came with the case - Materials: Nylon Mini-Diamond Ripstop, Mini-Weave Duralite and Duraweave. Don't know anymore. Suggest logging on to Amazon site or manufacturer webpage.
Approximately 8 pounds.. MUCH lighter than my old luggage..That made all the difference in packing, and not exceeding the weight limit!!
There are two straps, each one about 3 or 4 inches away from the end. They are really long adjustment cords and stayed tight during all my trips.

Not at all, ours fit just fine. It's a tiny bit big, but there's room, so it's not too loose. It doesn't fall off, and she LOVES it.
Hello this costume is a one size fits all for sizes 4-6X.
On dress It say 4-6 and No it doesn't fit 11yr old unless they have a 11-14
Unfortunately, it didn't give options for sizes. If I remember correctly, it said for ages 3 to 5. But it runs small.
no just 3t-6t
No, it will be really small. I bought it for my four years old daughter and it fits her really well. She is an average size kid, so by looking at it; I believe that if your child is an average (height and weight) kid; it will not fit her.
My daughter has had her dress for a few months, and it does not drop glitter at all.
No
I bought it for my 2 year old granddaughter for a Christmas present. She is tall and skinny for her age and my daughter thinks it still might be a little big at Christmas. I never did see what size it really wad
According to the tag, it is all polyester except for some of the white fabric, which is nylon.
Olive
low profile
remove batteries. brush it with dampened brush and soapy solution but not totally wet. so far so good! good luck, a
Yes
Black hard plastic handle, just like any other umbrella.
The handle is long.
Yes, it does zip into the liner. Great jacket!
About the same combined weight of a light fleece jacket and shell jacket.
M=175/ L=180
I used them for a children's birthday party craft- they rusted pretty quickly- the plating didn't rub.
I have only used two of the bracelets and did not have any problems unscrewing the end.
Rockin Beads only has 3 sizes at this time because they have large beads added to them 7 1/2 is our smallest
The side with the lobster clasp is the only side that opens. When chains open from both sides they can untwist while they are being worn. To twist off push together the cap and chain and twist counter clockwise.
I believe it to be wood, covered with heavy duty, printed, glossy paper. Very well made. I was very pleased. (The little dancing mermaid is cheaper plastic). I would definitely buy another for a little girl.
No, it has 3drawers and a top section just like the picture shows.
The box is a good size. I'm honestly not sure about the exact dimensions. I think that the box would be great for any girl ages 3-8. I got it for my daughter for her 4th birthday. It is both sweet and durable. For as much as we have played with the mermaid figure and the winder, it has withstood it all. I would highly recommend it.
As noted in other answers... these socks do seem fairly quick to dry, but local conditions (high humidity due to weather) could determine whether the socks would dry completely overnight. Taking two pair to rotate is a good suggestion... also taking a small microfiber towel to roll the socks in (roll & squeeze socks after washing/rinsing to wick excess water from the socks) before setting out to dry would be a good idea. The Silver Drystat in the blend will retard odor as well as speed up the drying. If necessary the socks could be worn 2 days between washings easily without any fear of odor unless feet are prone to being very sweaty, or a person is engaged in athletic activities.
They run a little large. i wear a 12 and ordered the xl and they're too long.
About medium. Not so much that you get 'sausage legs' above the sock but enough to feel them lifting your feet. Very supportive around the Achilles area. I have fairly fat calves and they don't hurt, my sister is thinner and she loves them. Stops her feet aching when she works 9 hours a day on them.
So far so good regarding smelly socks. Certainly don't have any foot odour at all when taken off. They also wash really well and come out of the machine virtually dry.
Not sure on exact size range from the manufacturer....but I wear a men's size 9-1/2, sometimes 10, and I purchased the Medium size. Fits well, albeit snug due to the compression. I'm an average size male.

I just got them. They are still the longer length not 17 inches. Exactly like I wanted and like they are in the picture.
The diameter of the "blade" is about 2".
27 inches, including the handle
Yes, they will accept a strong glue. (Crazy, gorilla, etc). However, they do bend, so will be ok for a decoration, but if kids use them to play, they probably won't hold.
It's a plastic pipe with a foam sheath. ( very frail plastic pipe - decently soft. No way to cause serious injury )
I don't remember the actual size since they were purchased quite some time ago for a child's bday party.
They work great! You just follow the directions. The panel can be placed in different positions of your thigh to create different lifts depending on where you most need it. I wore them the other day, hot hot day and for 8 hrs - no problem except it takes a bit of scrubbing to get the glue reside off, but a small price to pay for a smooth looking leg!
I'm not sure about the arm area, as I only used the leg lifts. It did help, but did not hold for very long, you can see the product through your clothes, and it peels away after a short time. If you were just needing the effect for an hour or two, it might help, but much longer than that I think you will be disappointed.
I wore them wading briefly at the beach but I'm not sure how well they'd hold up if they got soaked in a pool.
I truly don't know, but again....it's painful taking them off. Maybe using baby oil on them or getting them wet in the shower would help.
It's 5 pair , so a total of 10. Yes one per leg.
I've tried but the adhesive isn't as tight. Hope this helps.
No, sorry, but we use different formulas and sizes depending on where they are going on the body. The Thigh Lift formula is too aggressive for the tender arm area. They are each formulated to give all day wear and comfort to the area for which they were created.
Mine is 18"H x 13"W x 8.5"D and it is large enough to fit a 17" laptop plus padding or magazines.
Simply a different color. THAT was very disappointing. A couple of co-workers have old JanSport backpacks, from 10-20 years ago that have leather bottoms. They seem to stand upright much better than mine. That being said, it's a very high-quality backpack and I think it will last a long time.
No. The only padding is on the back of the backpack when it rests on your back. If you dropped it, your laptop could possibly be damaged.
My girls carry at least (2) 2"-binders plus spiral notebooks & gym tshirts, a waterbottle and more on any given day. Their bags are heavy, but they hold a ton!
Yes
I'm not sure. I would think you would use the receipt from Amazon, yes. Good luck
Mine is 18"H x 13"W x 8.5"D and it is large enough to fit a 17" laptop plus padding or magazines.
Simply a different color. THAT was very disappointing. A couple of co-workers have old JanSport backpacks, from 10-20 years ago that have leather bottoms. They seem to stand upright much better than mine. That being said, it's a very high-quality backpack and I think it will last a long time.
No. The only padding is on the back of the backpack when it rests on your back. If you dropped it, your laptop could possibly be damaged.

A girls size 12/14. My daughter is 12 and wore it this past Halloween. Fit perfect.
The dress comes as a 1 piece all together. You get the puffy slip to go under the skirt portion of the 1 piece. The belt and Velcro neck scarf come as well. The costume was the best for my daughter. So many compliments.
Pink
Yes, but it's not adjustable, it's Velcro on the end (it was a little big on my daughter).
I use it for commuting every week day and that means dragging it down the stairs a lot, but also picking it up and carrying it a lot by the handle. I am a pretty rough user of this bag and there are no signs of any weakness in the top handle.
More of a burgundy.
It's a dark red, but not really burgundy.
I believe O/S stands for one size. It's a roomy backpack. Fits the kids' textbooks, and has multiple zipped pockets. Sturdy. Using it for second year in a row. Wheels are smooth, retractable handle glides well, and the material is still in good shape.
Both..depending on how you pack
For the past year, I have used the Jansport Driver 8 backpack. I have never experienced a problem with the bottom collapsing, even with it loaded down by multiple heavy textbooks and a laptop. It wont tip if the largest compartment carries the most weight. However, it will tip if the front compartments have the most weight.
The larger compartment does have two zippers. I would think that it could accommodate two tennis rackets. It is deep enough from front to back, and looking at it, it seems like it would be wide enough. The handles of the rackets would stick out though.
I use this for college -- I carry about five textbooks and a handful of folders along with a few notebooks of paper. I also carry a pencil box, a little bag that holds my digital recorder, as well as lip gloss and other things. I carry my lunch bag and I still have room for a bit more. Lots of compartments. I enjoy using it.
Yes with room to spare... It's a great bag!!
This backpack is truly amazing. You can fit three binders and still have room.

This is the blue one. You can tell from the stripes.
I brought this bag for my daughter who has it at school right now but she fits her laptop (regular size, not mini) into it for school. So, I would say yes!!
Yes. Easily. My daughter can fit her mackbook in with cables, along with her ipad, books...and other things. There is also a pocket on the front that holds a lot of stuff. Very durable. She's 11 and takes it everywhere from school to vacation.
I think it would be a good bag because of the several different pockets. However, if you will be carrying a lot of books back and forth, it may be not be the backbag for you. I remember my kids in high school having a lot of heavy books and this is not quite large or sturdy enough for that much weight. You would be better off with a bag from LLBean or Lands' End.
No. I will falling a part in 2 weeks
Probably, but thr straps are really flimsy so I wouldn't get it if I were you.
Mine is 16" long X 12" Wide X 10 " deep. Your data seems to be an error unless it is a smaller model
I have two in the trunk of BMW Sedan. There are inserts in the bottom for rigidity.
Easily 50 to 75 or more as an estimate, but coud be heavy to carry around
Yes- you may need to turn it lengthwise- but the dividers and inside both have Velcro so you can be creative on your configuration.
The one I received looked just like the picture. There was no choice of color.
I don't think the cover is big enough to cover the area once a zipper is installed. The fabric is quite tough. As for weight, I have mine pretty full but with maybe 5 or so pounds of stuff. It isn't really rigid enough for a lot of weight.
Hi Gary - It is half canvas and 1/2 ??? feels like many laptop bags; we are not sure of the exact fabric. My husband just loves this bag for the car and that he can carry in the house to his office. Excellent product
They fit my 13 year old daughter who wears a woman's size 8 shoe, even after several washes. Hope this helps.
No the socks are what I'd describe as a thick nylon but are still comfy. Only thing to worry about is the cape. My capes are starting to unstring but it's a quick fix.
They are one size fits all pretty much... They should look fine might just go up a little higher on the leg. Enjoy!
There is a switch at the bottom of the handle. It is a disguised to look like the rest if the handle but if you look closely you will see it. There are three settings 0 I II. O is off I is demo and II is normal play.
Plastic
It's all in the instructions - there is a screw to remove first.
1)If you press once the blue light will On. You press once again it will go off. You press once again the red light will On. 2) Under On mode, you press and hold the button for a few seconds it will change blue to red together with the Darth Vader sound effect.
oh yes it does
No. It is permanently attached.
There is a switch with three (3) positions at the bottom of the light saber: 1 - Off, 2 - 'auto transform', and 3 - 'normal'. In the 'normal' mode, the on/off switch on the side turns the light saber on. The first time it comes on the light is blue for Anakin. Turning it off and then back on, the light is red for Darth Vader. If you want it blue again, turn it off and back on.
I has a similar problem, but I change the batteries and all right again. Ive had it eight months.
Well, this is a pretty nice version. Its higher quality than many. The $120.00 one is probably made with more premium materials, but you can't go wrong with this one.
Sorry but, no it doesn't.
It's about a foot. It's tall enough for necklaces to not hit the bottom. Can't say that for my long ones but it's effective enough.
The metal has some type of coating. Mine has not rusted or tarnished at all. However, it is not designed to get wet.
It's a very sturdy tree. The branches can hold more than 20+ HANGING earrings (depending on type and size). Cannot hold studs on the branches.
I suppose it could...it is quite well made and solid. It is about 12 inches tall with a 6" diameter base. The ornaments would have to be quite small or they may look out of place. Hope this helps!
The ends don't scratch at all. It's a nice jewelry tree.
It took a lot longer than I expected or was originally stated. It arrived a day or so after I inquired about the shipping. I would say it took approximately 2.5 weeks. It was only $14.99 I believe when I ordered it. I do like it and feel the quality is good so if you have the time to wait, it is worth it. When you order on Amazon though and are used to the 2 day prime shipping, waiting 2.5 weeks seems extreme. Hope this helps.
Hi....I place mine in the fork of the branches and then put the back piece on. Most earrings hold well. El.
It's metal.
12 inches tall. Diameter of base is 6 inches.
6 inch wide at base and middle branch area. 12 inch tall.
I bought these for my husband. He is a perfect size 31. I bought him a 30. His was a bit worried the first time he put them on but wears them all the time for Crossfit and Casually. So I'm guessing the size worked out great, otherwise they'd be folded away somewhere. The sizing recommends going down if your between sizes. It worked for him!
If you go to the EPIC website, they list pockets on the 1.0 model and don't list pockets on these. Probably no pockets.
I don't know the exact material but it is a good stretch material. I wouldn't buy these though...the Velcro will rub against your skin at the front and irritate you. There are better shorts out there that are cheaper.
They ride higher than other shorts I've got(basketball shorts mostly).... But not quite all the way up to the belly button. They sit maybe an inch away?
10 inches.
They seem to be accurate in measurements. I wear 30" in jeans and I ordered 30" and the shorts fit great. There is also a drawstring in them if they are a little bit big.

Size: One Size Bust: 95cm Length: 65cm Sleeve: 62cm Shoulder: 40cm
This is one size kind like M
The shirt didn't have a size on it....Im 5'4 and wear a Medium to a Large and this fits comfortably...
Karen, unfourtunately no. But it does hold my i-pad which is a 8x10.
It is a very big, over sized clutch but it is a good quality and real cute
the smell is normal,,it will disappear after several days ,you can put it in the Ventilated place.
I use to spray bath and body scents inside the bag. I also tried using moth balls. The smell eventually went but it took a while. I never used the straps because the straps still carry that smell but bag is ok now. It will take you a while but the scent will eventually go away just keep spraying it.
14.5" wide x 9" deep x 40" tall
It took me about ten to fifteen minutes. Really easy to assemble.
No. Only the top 3 drawers have dividers
Bought as a Christmas gift so we have not opened it yet.
Hi Connie, The dimensions are 14.5 x 9 x 40 inches.
Not sure. We purchased two and they are light blue with white mesh accents.
My daughter turned 6 years 1 month ago, also average height. She normally wears 7/8 tops and some size 10 tops. The 7/8 Elsa dress is a bit big on her. She definitely has room to grow in it.
My daughter is five yrs old and weights around 35 pounds I bought the 4-6 and it fitted perfectly
7 to 8 my grandaughter is 5 and the 10 fit better

Yes
If you select the next day option for next day and it says delivery 10/31/2014 then yes it is still possible
My niece is 8 & got her a 7/8 which fit. She is thin & low to average height. I guess ask Mom what % is on chart. If over 75% for age would go up size.
I think it runs true to size. But keep it mind (as the picture shows) it's supposed to go just mid calf. I got a 10/12 even thou my daughter is a 7/8. This way I have space to layer a long sleeve shirt underneath and the skirt goes all the way to the floor. The body part has an elastic so it's very adaptable if your daughter is either on the plus size or on the skinny size. Hope it helps.
Usually 3 to 5 days
It does not include shoes. The dress is not made well. My daughter likes to wear while playing and I have had to sew it back together a few times.
Yes its more like a size 4t-5t.
Depends on what size she is. My niece just turned 5 the other day. She wears size 5/6 and it just fit her. The 7/8 was to big and loose. If she eye any bigger the 4/6 would have been too tight. Hope this helps.
I would say the 4-6x would fit her fine. Both the 4-6x and 7-8 are 31 inches from shoulder to hem. If you are measuring your daughter from head to toe, I would say 31 inches from shoulder to hem would be fine. I bought this dress for my 5 yr old granddaughter, and it is perfect. I don't know her measurements, but she is tall for her age, and on the more slender-average side. The size 7-8 description is the same measurements as the 4-6x, (very confusing) so I suppose either would be fine. The 4-6x was fine when my granddaughter got it last Christmas, and she's still wearing it!
Size (3T-4T) is recommended for children with the following measurements: 34-38 lbs weight, 39-42" height, 22-23" chest, 20-21" waist and 22-23" hips. Small (4-6) is for children with the following measurements: 39-50 lbs weight, 3'3"-4'1" height, 26" chest, 23" waist and 26.5" hips.
Yes it does
For my daughter she has 107cm tall. The dress's length to her angle(I forgot how to spell). So the discription 4-6x, if over 120cm tall may be below to the knee!
No it's not necessary. Well, my daughter has not complained about it.
I'm pretty sure it's a replica because it is made by disguise not Disney. My granddaughter does love it though.
Years
I ordered the 7-8 for my 6 yrs old it fit perfectly except the underskirt runs big but we just cinched it up with a safety pin and it worked great.
No
The costume I ordered was for at 7-8 year old. I ordered it for my very tall 5 year old granddaughter. I had to make several alterations especially to the waist which I had to take in a few inches. Nice costume but cheaply made as they all are.
yes this is size 7-8
The inside dimensions of the case are as follows: Length = 12" (or 1 ft.); the Width is 16", and the Height of the case if 3.25" COMBINED (Bottom = 2.25"; the Top Upper Lip = 1". Plus the opening of the case, I measured at 55 degrees. See my quick, yet (I'm fairly sure) very accurate picture of it on Flickr at this address: http://flic.kr/ps/B3GDX Hope that helps!
Not sure what you mean by a "real lock", but it is a cheap bag. The lock works but if you wanted to brake into it, it would be very easy. The combination lock does work though.
No, it is attached to the backside
11.5x8x6
No they are not... but I am telling you SO worth the money....
Yes my husband has several large faced watches and they all fit.
No problem on the top shelf for 48+ watches, The lower drawer is a little snug, but no problem if you are careful closing the drawer. Enjoy.
Im pretty sure it is a 3/8 bar. They are the same size as all my others. It does not dig into the inside of my lip. Hope this helps
Stainless steel. I'm allergic to a lot of metals so if you are looking for something that won't bother you get these.
Usually international shipment will take 8-12 working days, not a month as amazon advertised.
If your helix is a size 16 gauge then yes. You need to find out what size your helix is.
16g
They look just like the picture
Yes take same size if you like it fit but if you like it to be little wider then take bigger
No, it's a felt material that's super staticy.
The interior is a tight fleece material. Truelly a great jacket for the price, but it's not the inside as much as the outside material ins't water resistance. But you cant go wrong with the jacket.
I bought the XXL for my son who is 6'1" and 210lb Fits him perfect. The jacket is stylist and hangs correctly over the back and front.
I usually wear a perfect XL and found this XL slightly big with very long arms.
It is a bonded material smooth and nylon outside and fleecy inside. I found it very warm and wind resistant.
It's made in China, and be careful of the size you order. I couldn't get into mine because it was much smaller than indicated on the tag...about 2 or 3 sizes too small.

It will fit any size wrist, child or adult.
Yea, it totally does. I set the time myself, it's really not hard to figure it out-and the battery wasn't activated before I got it, so it's a nice fresh one.
About 2 weeks, we post the item by usps.
You have to hold the button in order to change the time
Maybe the bettary is death
I don't know how to Cuz mines hasn't ran out battery's
There are 2 lace clips included. You insert the laces onto the clip. It will permanently lock the lace inside the clip. Just make sure you insert about 1/2 inch lace inside the clip.
I have no idea, but they appear very strong. I do not use them for exercise or bad weather, so not a good judge
Yes they will. I bought a pair for my four year old. You cut them to what ever size you need.
I'm so sorry I don't know.. I bought them for my brother who had a stroke and can't tie his shows any longer... The are wonderful... I have no complaints.. None... Good luck John
The laces are 42" long and can be used with high tops. They also stretch considerably by design, so with most footwear, the length will be more than adequate. We have numerous clients, as well as in-office staff members using EZLACES with high tops, however, depending on the height / cut of your high tops, and also how tight you prefer your laces, you may need to loosen / adjust the tension of your EZLACES in order to slip your shoes on and off. We will also be sure to update / edit our listing to ensure that the lace length is clearly shown in the details. Thanks!
They come in pairs.
One pair.
Yes. You trim the laces before you clip them at the ends.
Yes. A surprisingly decent pair of shorts for the money.
There are two zippered pockets located in the mid-thigh area on each leg. Good for holding keys, phone, wallet, etc.
Yes, you should be good with that.
There is just a drawstring, be cautious about the sizing, I ordered for a size largef and they were still to small
no it is sewn in
one of the zippers got stuck on mine closed with my license and debit card in it. I tried with vice grips and pliers and only exploded the zipper handle. I ended up cutting a small corner of the inside of the pocket to get my stuff out. Once they stick close I think they're done forever. I will probably update my review about this now
Size XXL (36-39) probably works for you. My waits size is ~33 and size L (30-33) fits me just fine.
I am size 33-34 and a med fits me well not too tight. Maybe a XXL will fit you
Yes....it fits me fine. They are actually a little big But work.

This is more than just "a mask." The facade created when wearing it is far beyond momentary enjoyment, for once on your head, you will transcend your mere mortal form, venturing into dimensions mathematics cannot fathom. Your previous life will seem but as significant as a single grain of sand does to an entire beach; your mind will be forever opened to endless possibilities, countless questions and most importantly to the knowledge that this is everything but just a simple mask. This is a mask that the universe wears to shield itself from the reality that is known by only those whom wear it. Buyer beware, as the great prophet Goku once said, "Kamehameha" which translated means "Some minds simply cannot take knowing the truth that is their existence."
I would have to say "no", because I can't get it ON with glasses on! Too tight. I think you'd need a pretty small head to do it...
Yes, but may be a bit smaller and tighter than what it seems.
Not really the mouth and nose holes are open but that it. I wouldn't recommend driving with it on. Risk the chance of piping a curb and taking out a stop sign. I mean if you were to drive while wearing it I mean. Not that anyone would.
I'm a 10 1/2 size shoe and ordered the XXL. It fits but is not sloppy or over large. Sizing on carry bag is Men's--7/8(L),9/10(XL),11/12(XXL),13/14(3XL) Women's--5/6(S),7/8(M),9/10(L),11(XL).
Here is the link to Baffin's website and their size chart www.baffin.com/product-p/61310000.htm. I would suggest the XXXL just because 13 is the starting size for the XXXL.
It might. Without saying definitely yes or no, since their sizes reflect overseas manufacture. My size is 13 and oversize (XXL) fits well and is easy to get my feet into. If you want a snug fit, (a suggestion only) order same size. Otherwise, order oversize. When reading online reviews, most people do order oversize. Sorry for not committing. I don't want to mislead you. Be safe and don't buy a pair without knowing for sure you can return them if you don't like the fit.
No, I wear them at home, inside, during winter months. They are very warm, but not waterproof.
They do have a L & R
The specs say down, but I cant remember ever seeing feathers. Usually with true down products one sees a few feathers that punch through the nylon. That being said, they do keep my feet warm and sure feel like down slippers. I have had these slippers for many years and bought a second pair in anticipation that the first pair will eventually wear out. They havent yet and I have them on all of the time. Down or not, they were a good buy.
X large, the elastic cinches allow you to tighten them down.
I suggest size 9. You will love these booties as they are cozy and warm on feet and ankles.
I like them
Not at all water-resistant. If you step in a puddle you're in trouble. I wear them outdoors, to the store, and in the house barefoot. Get them extra big so you can step in and out of them easily. When I'm outdoors I am very careful about water. You can walk on a wet sidewalk, but you cannot step in a puddle. I would not wear them outdoors in heavy rain.
I can't say for a fact they are or aren't. When I received them, many had imperfections and flaws. That leads me to think that those are scrappers. Meantime, others looked great. With all that in mind, I was able to trade all 75 I bought with no problem at Disney World.
They are definitely able to trade. As far as are they all "real" apparently some are, some aren't. My good friend received one that according to a Disney cast member, was very rare. All cast members will trade these with you, extreme collectors (people who know what they're doing) most likely won't. Ours were all really good quality and a good variety.
You should be able to get them.
I didn't get one. It was a random mix of pins. The picture is just possible pins you can get sorry. Or I would.
No
If you want to order and get by Christmas you will receive by Christmas standard shipping has to be ordered by 12/19/2014 and Prime on Monday 12/22/2014.
Yes, all my Disney pins I have bought came with the black Mickey rubber back.
Yes they all do, and are tradable within the parks.
Assorted Disney.
No, mine where all random. Not the ones pictured.
I have a 48mm Breitling and there is no problem. It depends also on how many watches you have and howccrowded the watches would be. I can tell you that for the money this watch box is excellent in quality
Hello. No you can't at all. It is lovely and VERY well made. I've bought several of them in the past and this is by far the nicest and sturdiest one I've gotten.
real glass
Yes you can and it has little drawers also.
about 2 lbs
Upper: 3.5" (L) x 2" (W) x 2" (D); Lower: 3.5" (L) x 2" (W) x 1.5" (D). Overall the depth is 0.5" different. If you have large watches, it's tight to fit in the lower drawer. I hope this will help!
I don't have the measurements as I am at work. However, the box is beautiful and very well made. I would purchase as a gift for anyone that wants a watch box.
My Grandaughter is a US size 11 and they fit her perfectly. Hope this helps.
They are about a child size 10, but being open in back gives a little leeway. Just a note of caution: they are a little loud on hardwood and tile floors, and they can cause blisters if worn too long being that they are a hard plastic material.
They are about a size 8. my daughter is also 3 and they fit her fine. She wears a size 8 shoe.
Big for our 2 year old. She wears a 5.5 now. Hopefully would fit her in a year. I don't know if it will fit 7.5 but it's a slip on.
There isn't a size listed on the shoes. My daughter wears a size 9 and they fit her, but she's been wearing them since Christmas, when they were big on her. There are several other questions and answers in regard to the shoe sizes of the children using the shoes.
I'm not in the business of selling merchandise!! Maybe you should order a book on English spelling and structure through Amazon however.....
I only have toddler boys shoes to compare them too and they are the same size as his shoe which is a 9C
These will work for you.
My granddaughters are ages 2 and 3, and they both wear these shoes. They are strictly for dress up, and should not be worn for an extended long time. The girls would sleep in them, if we let them.
One size only from what I have found (online and in retail)
i ordered a 43 for my husband who wears a size 10. the shoes were too smal....so, I'm guessing that if you wear a 9.5 you should order a 43. My husband really loves these spinning shoes!
These should be ok. They do not tend to be wide.
I wear a size 10 and I bought 44 and they fit perfect
My husband wears a size 10. I originally ordered a European size 43 and they were too small. I had to exchange them for a 44. My husband loves the shoes for biking and spinning.
Half or one size larger. Depending if you like a tigher or looser fit
I would get the 45. I have 44 and they are a little snug.
There is a shoe chart accompanying the Amazon offering. When you buy pedals, you get cleats. And then attach them to the shoe. Find out what cleat style (there are several) you spinning cycle uses; you can order them through Amazon.
Find s size chart that converts. US sizes to UK. This should help with sizing.
That should fit. Zappos has a good size conversion chart. I wouldn't go any smaller than the 46. They seem to be just a little on the small side.
Unless you can go to a sporting goods or cycling shop to try on different cycling shoes, which I highly suggest for the fit, you can google the international shoe size converter chart

Most times if order is placed before 2pm they ship the same day...
I contacted this seller about ordering 20 of these for a group event and was told they would offer a 10% discount on the $135.00 shipping. You heard me correctly. They would charge 121.50 to ship 20 of these very small and light weight dog tags. It may not be illegal but it is certainly unethical.
Unfortunately, it does not. It only comes with the silver beaded chain.
I'm not sure but if you're considering coming anywhere close to maxing out the available space, it is printed portrait. Landscape would have looked much better for the phrase I desired.
No
The best way to tell us how to engrave and engraving text is to contact us through amazon after you make the purchase.
I dont know if a logo can be engraved but you can engrave both sides of the tag
You can wear it everyday the tag will not rust but the chane it comes with will
It doesnt give a size....my granddaughter wears a five and it was a good fit...not too snug..I even told my daughter she could probably remove those sleeves..but it fit her well...hope this helps...she wore it to breakfast with Ariel at Disney....she loved it..
Bought it for our granddaughter on her 5th birthday. She was wearing a 4T and 5T and it worked well.
Best estimate for size is 3T-4-T
It fits 3-4T but is loose in the chest area, she had to wear an undershirt for Halloween but works great for dress up going over clothes.
It's shorter than I would have expected but not bad (just below knee) and although my daughter wears a 5T, it just fits. She will grow out of it soon. If you want it to fit for a while, you daughter should just be in a 4T or just getting into 5T.
Yes I ordered for my friend her daughter is 110cm perfect fit
The back is made of the stretchy nylon that most costumes are made of so it's pretty stretchy.
Yes, my daughter is almost 3 and has plenty of room in it.
Depends on what you are calling medium. This dress is a one size fits all. I would say it fits girls sizes 4-8 depending on the size of the child. I hope this helps.
If you are wondering if this would fit a tall 2t/3t the answer would be probably not. It may fit in the length, but would be big every place else. This is a "one size fits all" and those kinds of dresses run big. When I bought it for my little girl she was wearing size 4t in everything and it was big on her. I had to take it up a couple inches in the length, a couple inches in the shoulders, and an inch in the back and she still had room to grow in it. She is now into 5t and can still fit in this dress even with my alterations. Hope this helps.
Yes, however, it runs a bit small. My daughter is 4 and it fits a bit tight.
the wig really has bad quality, it is so small and of cours that some strands coming undone, even if you try to take care.
My 3 yr old granddaughter has an adult size head, so she can not wear the kids wig. We bought the adult one, and it fits her just fine. Some of my nieces that range in age from 2-10 yrs old can wear this wig with no problem.
It fits my 4 year old and 6 year old.
Yes, although with room to grow. My daughter is a petite almost-3; 36 " tall and 26 lbs. She wears it over clothes, and although there is room in the shoulders , it does not fall off. The hem comes to her ankles. Hope that is helpful!
Size 2-4 and fits a 4 year old, size 4 perfectly.
I felt the quality was good for a costume. My granddaughter is 3 years old, so the small was a little big, but she wears it almost constantly, and it has held up well so far.
My granddaughter is 3 and wears a 3-4T.....fits her perfectly. This would be too big for an 18 month old.
I do a spot clean method on it.
yes, i think it's ages 4-6. my daughter is 4 years old, 35lbs and 38 inches tall. it fit her pretty well, maybe just a little bit big.
I believe so. It came with a Disney hanger. Its not like the super super nice ones that cost $100+ but the quality is great
Yes it fits good on my 4 year old.
Yes but it was tolerable to my 4 year old for almost an hour.
I purchased this for my granddaughter who is almost 5, it fits her well and she wears about a 5/6 I don't know if it will fit a 3 year old depends on her size, I think it would be very big on her.
Based on our experience, I would tend to say no, unless your daughter has a smaller than average head. My daughter is 5 1/2, and it was way too small for her.
No, would be too small. It's nice but barely big enough for my 3 1/2 yr old
Hello, it fits my 5y Daughter. she is 3' 1". I guess it will.
I'm not sure...it was for a 10 year old girl and it didn't cover her head properly for her age. I seemed like it was for a 3 year old.
Amazon ships my products . Do if amazon ships there we can
I try with Disney store but they are more expansev than amazon.
I have no idea about the color, but the quality is horrible and not to mention the size is like for a 2 year old. It doesn't fit my 5 year old at all.
Fit any size
My daughter is a 4t and it fit her! Actually, it was a little big, room to grow!
I bought this for my three year old. It is a bit big on top so she wears a tshirt under it. I would say it would work for most 3-5 year olds and smaller 6 year olds.
There is a hoop...plastic I think. The hoop is high....around hip height. Sitting is fine as long as you pull up on the dress a little so you're not actually sitting on the hoop. It's a beautiful dress.
It may be big. My little girl is 5 and it was slightly big at the top. Now if she wears other clothes underneath it may be ok. I hope this helps
I would say it fits a size 4T or 5T. No bigger.
Yes, it is Jakks Pacific
The item is one size fits 4-6x.
I looked at different websites with the dress to see what size a S, M, L fit. Then ordered accordingly.
I sent this item back.....I am not sure. The dress has a slip that does not come all the way down so the fit is off.
It's really good, it will last a long time and it's prettier than the picture. You won't regret buying it, my niece loves it.
This is A dress from Frozen. It is the same one I bought. It is very cheaply made. The fabric rips very easily and the hem comes apart on you. It is not worth the money they are asking for, no matter how badly your loved one wants it.
My daughter just turned 5 and wears a size 6 in clothes and this dress fits her perfect.
The actual dress is a cheep silky material (acetate?) The netting is very stiff, scratchy ??? Not at all comfortable against the skin.
I'm not exactly sure. My daughter is 5 and it hits her mid shin
The item details state "For ages 3 plus, size 4-6X"
I don't know , I live in Brazil, but I can say that I loved the dress and my daughter too, the price is really great. It was delivered on time, I have nothing to complain about .
No.
It was my niece's Christmas gift, so I don't have it. It has an elastic waistband and it's true to size. She's a size 6 and the dress still had room to expand some more; length about mid-calf.
Yes..it's really a 4-6 but my daughter is tall and wears a 5 now and it fit perfectly.
It reaches a 4 year old's shin about 2 inches below the knee.
Pretty sure it's nylon and yes diffused light does come through.
the wooden part is 4" the over all length is about 25"
Could be used for sun or rain but it's very small.
The umbrella stays the same length as it is when open and closed
24 1/2 inches is the length of this umbrella when closed. This umbrella does not fold up, the length will always be 24 1/2 inches.
4t-5t
It was fairly long. I cannot measure because we threw it in the garbage! The material was so scratchy, my granddaughter refused to wear it after trying it on. Such a disappointment. I would not buy this if I were you.
You can not wash it because of the electronics. I guess dry cleaning might work. However, I ended throwing the dress out because it was so "scratchy" that my granddaughter would not wear it. Bad product.
My daughter is 5 and she will only be able to wear once, would be good for 3-4 year old.
My inventory is kept at Amazon's warehouse and is fulfilled by Amazon. My account is open to overseas sales and shipping. We have sold many items to Russia, Japan & Spain. They were shipped overseas for a small additional charge. So the short answer is yes but it is ultimately Amazon's decision. Thanks & I hope this answered your question
The color palette is pretty feminine I am a female who bought it
Could use it to carry a wet towel or bathing suit outside of your bag, I suppose. As for me, I repurposed it and use it to wrap around my rolled up yoga mat.
Here is what I got from adidas: Measurements: Bottom Width: 19 in Middle Width: 19 in Top Width: 19 in Depth: 9 1&#8260;2 in Height: 11 in Strap Length: 38 in Strap Drop: 18 in Weight: 1 lb 7 oz I found that this bag is much larger than I had anticipated, which is great. It holds everything for the gym plus shower stuff and clean clothes/shoes. Hope that helps!
It does not.
Is the same size, no difference, there is only one size
A clam shell zipper.
No
Approximates, though gives a little when totally stuffed full. It's enough for sneakers, a pair of sandals, two-three pairs of workout shirts, bras, & shorts, a small towel, also any deodorant, cosmetics, etc. - depending how well you can pack. Length: 19" Width: 10" Height: 12"
I bought this a couple months ago. In mine I put a change of clothes, boxing gloves (which take up a lot of room), my tennis shoes, and I keep my container of pre-workout powder in the bag as well. I also keep lots of little things in there like deodorant, lotion, etc....hope that helps!
Yes, on the end. The compartment fits inside the bag and the other items are protected from the shoes. There is also a separate compartment for wet items.

My mirror came with the tool to use.
It is a reflective plasticy (bendable) material, but it is NOT a real glass mirror. The material has subtle ripples in and is not as brightly reflective as a real mirror. It also has dents in it because of the way it is glued in.
There are 120 holes/slots for earrings to go. I use some of the empty ring slots for my stud earrings.
Holds about 90 rings. I don't wear post style earrings but holder doesn't fold out. Sometimes I have trouble getting wire earrings out
It is only for a stand. If you wanted to hang it over a door or mount it to a wall, you would have to do that on your own.
yes, we do. but the shipping cost is very high and we only ship UPS expedited 2 days to Canada. Please let us know if you are interested. Thanks
The lock was already on my door and just the key was in a plastic bag. The lock works fine.
yes, the legs are included
It is lockable.
No, unfortunately not that I can tell. But, there are some sold through Amazon that do mount on the wall/door.
When hung.....top to bottom is 4 ft. Great for long necklaces. The width is 14.25 in. The mirror covers the front with a 2.25 in boarder. The depth is 3.75 in when closed. If you do purchase this whatever color don't forget to put the small springs for the trays and if your like me you will love this.
It hangs to the top of my head, and I'm 5'7". They are moderately adjustable. I'm very happy with the quality of it...T
I do not understand your question. What package? Measurements for the Height and Width of the unit are in the description. It comes in a very secured box. Very nicely made.
It's a real mirror. Good reflection. I really enjoy having this instead of a jewelry box on the counter or dresser. I love it!
It can simply be lifted off door. You could always secure it to a door or wall though with screws.
I haven't had either of these issues yet so I have no recommendation. Sorry
Yes. There are five trays, and each tray has three bins. The trays are removable.
You need to keep the silica packets in cabinet also you can not have sterling touch other metals due to eletriclitic.
47 3/4" Tall, 4" Deep, 14 1/4" Wide
I'm sorry to hear your order arrived damaged! You can initiate a return or replacement through our Online Returns Center:
there are only three sizes
They run small.. I would order a large
too small the bra is about a cup
It should it very universal.
You can adjust defrost duration + interval on the device. (Maybe a screwdriver is required... Very easy to do)
The timer worked for 2 months then stopped
Please get me the model number and I'll look it up. This will work for some older models. The only way to know is by model number.
Unfortunately we do not stock the UET240. We could order you one if you would like.
Nor did mine. I just matched using the wiring diagram of fridge with the diagram shown on the face of this timer. Works like a champ.
Dear Customer, Based on the model number provided 253.68882013. The correct part number needed is 241809402. Thank you and Best regards.
Yes it does. You can look up the timer on this site and It will show a picture and plug style just like the Supco timer. http://www.partadvantage.com/lookup/187507/1331263#
Yes I think it would.?. I have it on top of my dresser though. I think from side to side it will fit no problem, from top to bottom is what I would question. I'm still thinking it will fit.
Im not sure what size his watches are but he is an ex football (fullback)player and his watches are all big face style. He loves his gift. Hope that helps.
It's very cheaply made. The pull handle is only fixed to the outside. It doesn't even go through the drawer itself. Pry it open slowly with sonething and pull it open from the topeuthyour fingers. It's crap. Not worth the money. You are better off sending it back. But a one tier one like I did. Much better product.
Nope. Max width 48 mm
Only if you take them all out

i think 3 inch watch . but iam not sure . it is very nice product you can buy it
Yes, just make sure the watch is tight as possible on the pillows. Also make sure when you put the watch and pillow in together that it's pushed down all the way in its cubicle.
Mine has never broken, although I do not open and close it often. The ribbon is pretty cheap and thin. If you plan on opening the lid reportedly, I would get a metal hinge. If not, or does look very nice, especially for the price.
Side pocket on each side that empties into mesh enclosure. Total 2.
This is a good warm weather jacket for biking or hiking. In cold New Orleans weather it is a good wind breaker. Its main function for us is as a raincoat. It is a good raincoat or a good second layer for bikiing when the temp is in the 50s. It does not provide any real winter warmth. I have lived in Maine. This would be a summer coat.
I believe this jacket would be great for the golf course. It is super lightweight and provides protection from the rain WITHOUT any bulk. You can almost literally roll this up and stuff it in a pocket.
You can not all ways get what you wait, keeping dry or breathability it just does not work together. They mite say so but that is life.This is a very light jacket that will keep you dry there are side zipper to open up as well.
No, that's the main disadvantage. Only 2 big pockets outside.
Hey Taylor yes this jacket has a hoodie it's stiff and farm so when u put it on it stays on great item
no it doesn't. it is single shell
I know this does not answer your exact question, but maybe this will help...My husband is 5'7" and about 220lbs. He is very stalky with broad shoulders. He usually wears an XL so that is what I ordered. It fit him perfectly. The length is pretty much what it looks like in the picture, even for his height. Hope this helps somewhat.
I would say that I am on the Shorter size (5.6) and have broader shoulders than they rest. It seems to fit me well. Hope all works for you. Overall, it also it awesome. I wore mine today in fact. Terrible down pours, work shirt stayed dry as a bone.
Unfortunately it can't.

I have an Iphone 4s with a lifeproof case and it holds it perfectly.
They do indeed!
Yes they do. There are 5 loops
No they don't.
I would call it thin. One could also say "lite." I find them grand for quick workouts or even going out. They have a nice look and drape well, clean and simple. Glad my wife bought Three pair. She got these when I was rehabbing from back surgery and they were a perfect choice. If you are looking for a Medium to Heavy cloth, these are not for you. Also they have two front pockets which come in very handy, without getting in the way. Hope that helps, G
Yes
Idk. They were a gift for my grandson
My son wears a 30 inch waist in jeans, and they fit him perfectly, but I think with them having an elastic waist, you would be fine.
I usually wear a 30 or 31 and the small fits me perfect.

No, that's the main disadvantage. Only 2 big pockets outside.
Hey Taylor yes this jacket has a hoodie it's stiff and farm so when u put it on it stays on great item
no it doesn't. it is single shell
I know this does not answer your exact question, but maybe this will help...My husband is 5'7" and about 220lbs. He is very stalky with broad shoulders. He usually wears an XL so that is what I ordered. It fit him perfectly. The length is pretty much what it looks like in the picture, even for his height. Hope this helps somewhat.
I would say that I am on the Shorter size (5.6) and have broader shoulders than they rest. It seems to fit me well. Hope all works for you. Overall, it also it awesome. I wore mine today in fact. Terrible down pours, work shirt stayed dry as a bone.
Unfortunately it can't.
Side pocket on each side that empties into mesh enclosure. Total 2.
This is a good warm weather jacket for biking or hiking. In cold New Orleans weather it is a good wind breaker. Its main function for us is as a raincoat. It is a good raincoat or a good second layer for bikiing when the temp is in the 50s. It does not provide any real winter warmth. I have lived in Maine. This would be a summer coat.

I have an Iphone 4s with a lifeproof case and it holds it perfectly.
They do indeed!
Yes they do. There are 5 loops
No they don't.
I would call it thin. One could also say "lite." I find them grand for quick workouts or even going out. They have a nice look and drape well, clean and simple. Glad my wife bought Three pair. She got these when I was rehabbing from back surgery and they were a perfect choice. If you are looking for a Medium to Heavy cloth, these are not for you. Also they have two front pockets which come in very handy, without getting in the way. Hope that helps, G
Yes
Idk. They were a gift for my grandson
My son wears a 30 inch waist in jeans, and they fit him perfectly, but I think with them having an elastic waist, you would be fine.
I usually wear a 30 or 31 and the small fits me perfect.
It's an awesome jacket. Minnesota gets pretty darn cold so you'd probably want a layer under the jacket. May be a fleece.
I wouldn't trust it with a pack rubbing directly against it for an extended period of time. The shell is not durable.
I recommend the XXL - these hoodies fit snugly (I usually wear L, but had to upgrade to XL).
Small. It fits tight to begin with. It's designed to be an inner layer.
I'm 6'2' also and about 220 lbs. I know I purchased the largest size available (I think the XXL). I like some room so I can wear a good base layer if needed. If you are in a climate that gets below 20 F I would say go big so you can add sweatshirt under it comfortably.
China
I'm 180 cm and 97k and Large was small for me (too tight)
hi the color is orange .
Just a long sleeve shirt would be fine, otherwise you will be too warm. Wear it mountain climbing. I have friends that climb all over the world and this is what they recommended.
I am exactly the same specs as you and the large fits well. You could probably wear a medium but it is going to be pretty snug.

It fits a 2inch binder,and four 1 inch binder but it rips very very easily. My daughter's bag ripped after a month. First the straps and then the zipper and the backpack itself. She kept a light backpack too.
It broke the second time I used it and now I had to sow it back together. I wouldn't buy it.
Dear Friend, Thanks for your interest on our item.The backpack is made in china which compatible with 13" laptop.welcome to your next visit. Best Regards from Stylish Empire
Mid-thigh probably.. I'm 5'3" and it's a little above mid-thigh on me.. :)
One size fits all. It fits like a mini skirt to me & I'm like 5'6. It's not too short
I am 5'4", 100 lbs and it fits me pretty well. It is a little short so it'll look shorter than the picture. The material is great. Hope that helps you out!
No. But it might be a slight rise off the knees, so it will show a bit of thighs. Then again it's not suppose to be worn as a knee length skirt. Good quality too!
Size: FREE Waist:56-88cm Front length:35cm Skirt Diameter: 82cm
I would recomend a large, it will fall nice on you. please let me know if I'm right, thankyou.
I'm a size three jeans and it fit. It has an elastic waste so it would probably grip the waste a bit. Hope that helps
The skirt will fit at the waist not at the hips and it's quite short so you'll have to wear something underneath personally I'm a size 4-6 and I haven't been able to wear it once because it's too small
yes it dose. the way that is made, it dose flare. belive me. other wies i would had return it. when I tried it on, I loved it. and to tell you, it is short, It all depends on you hight. thankyou
Honestly it should. It's really short & if you make some slight adjustments it's should fit pretty well. Hope I helped
I think it does. I was having an issue with my shoulder, bought this shirt and I had less to no pain while I wore it vs. not wearing it. I don't know if it was just a coincidence but I think it may have worked.
I have no idea. I ordered a mediumn it was too small. I am 5' 10 and weigh 190. I had my wife take it in about an inch on each side. It still doesn't give me the sypport I was expecting. I would not spend/waste my money again.
I bought this shirt for my dad who has a lot of arthritis in his lower back. He wears his 24/7 & says it helps him feel & move better. He ended up buying 2 more so he never goes without wearing it. Hope this helps answer your question
by hand warm water
you can try doing a XL and you can let me know how it fits you cause i have one and it fit me great where i haven't had any pain for about 4 weeks
I am a large man! I normanly buy 3XL tee shirts. 2XL was the largest tommie copper available @ Amazon so I gave it a try. It is quite snug but not uncomfortable. I often wear it to bed. The fabric stretches a lot.
no my husband wears a XL and that is what I bought..it is so tight he can't wear it, my neighbor is 225 and bought a 2X and it is too tight on him too.
The size chart can be found on the Tommie Copper web site.
Depends on chest size -- I wear XL based on a 48" chest. They are designed to be snug so also keep that in mind. Amazon has good return policies if it does not work out initially. Cheers.
I also wear a 1X top. I have a 1X Tommie Copper. It is meant to be a compression style fit, so it is tight. More like a spanx type fit than a T-shirt fit. It is comfortable. I wear mine underneath other shirts.
Mine is a short sleeve V-neck t-shirt. It's pretty comfortable but I would also like to tell you that I have worn it a lot and don't see any improvement in the pain in my upper back. My pain is from a repetitive motion injury due to 32 years of intense computer work so maybe it just doesn't work for that. Good luck with yours!!
I went to the regular Tommie copper site, they have a size chart. Then I ordered it here. It has sure helped my shoulder pain.
this shirt fits below the waist.
My daughter and I find that if we order one size larger than we usually wear I works. If you want it really tight then order your regular size. Hope this helps.

5-9 170 lbs.what size do I need?
Be sure NOT to use fabric softener.
I'm 6 ft 210 lbs 64 years old. The XL fits just right. You want it tight enough to apply pressure. I wear it for everything. Not to sleep though.
Cold water wash. Lay flat or hang dry. Dries really fast.
I'm 215 and a 38. I bought an XL in the Tommie Copper. It's a compression shirt so you want it a little tight. Bill
you can go to their website click on the product,, then click on the sizing chart and it will give you measurements you can go by. http://www.tommiecopper.com/product/mens-short-sleeve-shirt
I wear xlarge t shirt what size do I need to order
The sizes run on rh small size. If you are an x-large it will be snug. If you have a large waistline it will be really snug there. I wished for myself I would have ordered th next size up
Tommy Copper is a compression garment that for me helps to relieve aches and pains. A superior product that I wear daily.
yes the size was accurate, but keep in mind these are "compression shirts" designed to be snug. my husband usually wears a large, he is a tall guy but relatively thin. at first he was a little hesitant but after getting it on he was very comfortable.
I'm 6-3 and size 9.5 I bought med but I should have got large. If you want them to cover your whole calf.
Yes. They are - just don't use dryer sheets. Not sure why, but that is what Tommie Copper says specifically.
cannot answer that querstion

you can go to their website click on the product,, then click on the sizing chart and it will give you measurements you can go by. http://www.tommiecopper.com/product/mens-short-sleeve-shirt
I wear xlarge t shirt what size do I need to order
The sizes run on rh small size. If you are an x-large it will be snug. If you have a large waistline it will be really snug there. I wished for myself I would have ordered th next size up
Tommy Copper is a compression garment that for me helps to relieve aches and pains. A superior product that I wear daily.
yes the size was accurate, but keep in mind these are "compression shirts" designed to be snug. my husband usually wears a large, he is a tall guy but relatively thin. at first he was a little hesitant but after getting it on he was very comfortable.
I think it does. I was having an issue with my shoulder, bought this shirt and I had less to no pain while I wore it vs. not wearing it. I don't know if it was just a coincidence but I think it may have worked.
I have no idea. I ordered a mediumn it was too small. I am 5' 10 and weigh 190. I had my wife take it in about an inch on each side. It still doesn't give me the sypport I was expecting. I would not spend/waste my money again.
I bought this shirt for my dad who has a lot of arthritis in his lower back. He wears his 24/7 & says it helps him feel & move better. He ended up buying 2 more so he never goes without wearing it. Hope this helps answer your question
by hand warm water
you can try doing a XL and you can let me know how it fits you cause i have one and it fit me great where i haven't had any pain for about 4 weeks
I am a large man! I normanly buy 3XL tee shirts. 2XL was the largest tommie copper available @ Amazon so I gave it a try. It is quite snug but not uncomfortable. I often wear it to bed. The fabric stretches a lot.
no my husband wears a XL and that is what I bought..it is so tight he can't wear it, my neighbor is 225 and bought a 2X and it is too tight on him too.
The size chart can be found on the Tommie Copper web site.
Depends on chest size -- I wear XL based on a 48" chest. They are designed to be snug so also keep that in mind. Amazon has good return policies if it does not work out initially. Cheers.

5-9 170 lbs.what size do I need?
Be sure NOT to use fabric softener.
I'm 6 ft 210 lbs 64 years old. The XL fits just right. You want it tight enough to apply pressure. I wear it for everything. Not to sleep though.

I don't think so, I believe I bought a medium for 9.5 shoe size, the socks are super tight.
Mine were very hard to put on and they crushed my feet overnight ! TC told me size to get - gave them to aunt and she likes them. I'm going to order larger size because my old feet need some help !
I have varicose viens that are med to bad on the top of my right foot..a few spider viens in both legs/feet. I have invested a baby fortune in compression socks & #1 I couldn't see they did any good #2 I'm not sure I'm even stron enough to get them on #3 they always irritate my skin, they sweat, they are impractical for daily wear. The TC stockings are compression BUT you can get them on, they don't cut off circulation @ my knees, they don't sweat, they are comfortable to wear all day and they control the pain & occasional clots in the varicose viens--I LOVE THEM, I don't think of them as stylish but with pants & tennis shoes I guess no one knows or cares. Hope this helps
Yes they are but not the kind of compression that requires 2 people to put on & off. I bought large just becaue I didn't want to deal with that & these really fit the bill, they give support, they give relief & best of all I can actually put them on myself & they don't cut off circulation @ the knee cap. I love them, they are not PRETTY, but they do the job & I would never take a long trip by car or plane without wearing them & they don't make your skin sweat or itch. Highly recommend
Men's and they run small or are made to be very snug
I am a size 11 and it fits. You don"t have a choice here but if you go the the TC website, the do have an extra large which is recommended for size 13 foot.
I would wear these socks for every event I went to. The ankle socks are nice , they do have ladies colors.

Is thin, and very comfortable
the one I bought was all black and I gave it as a present so i don't have any input to contribute. sorry.
It is not as quiet as wool. It is fairly soft and I would say it does not make much noise while walking. If you are thinking that the metal lining would make a noise, this is not the case. Nice jacket!
A good quetion but i'm really happy from the quality of the jucket it slide very easy and not grabby :) . Enjoy
I use it for golfing. It is excellent forblocking the wind. I use it from about 32 degrees to low 50s. Any higher and I think you might get too warm.
Very lightweight and not overly snug or bulky at all. Great wind resistance. Reflective lining keeps in heat. We use it in boating conditions where dampness and wind can chill you. Not sure how this might relate to skiing, but that is what Columbia promotes it for.

I finally went to rei to see them in person and i don't believe the x-small will fit a 13" macbook but a small will
it poured yesterday here in NYC and I was walking in the rain about 6 block to my car with no umbrella. The contents in my bag where still dry. It does a good job I would say. I had 10 manilla envelopes in my bag and none were affected by water.
Medium size I don't think so. I would say 15" max.
There's no way to choose a left-handed version that I am aware of. For people who don't see the difference, it would be on the other shoulder thus making the napoleon pocket much harder to access as well as possibly the strap adjustment.
Take another look :) http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/A1A69fc3UeL._SL1500_.jpg
I have the medium with a Dell 15" Studio laptop and it fits neatly. I don't think there's enough padding so I only put it in my bag with a padded sleeve on it. But yes, right now I have my laptop, 2 full-size (8x10) paper notebooks, a few magazines, file folders, and my water bottle in the bag and it's not bulging much.
I think it's too small. I am 6 feet and it does look small. But I wanted a small bag. So it depends what u want to carry in the bag, that's more important question. Medium might not be a bad choice and can carry decent size stuff.
Small messenger
HI, The cross Strap is stored in the inside pocket of the bag. So if you open the bag, you will find a zipper. Open that and the cross strap is inside that compartment. Thats how i found out.
I don't carry a laptop all the time too and have been using this as my main bag for traveling as I pack one or two days of clothing inside. . I would recommend using a Grid-It organizer with this bag for smaller stuff like chargers etc.

I have the medium with a Dell 15" Studio laptop and it fits neatly. I don't think there's enough padding so I only put it in my bag with a padded sleeve on it. But yes, right now I have my laptop, 2 full-size (8x10) paper notebooks, a few magazines, file folders, and my water bottle in the bag and it's not bulging much.
I think it's too small. I am 6 feet and it does look small. But I wanted a small bag. So it depends what u want to carry in the bag, that's more important question. Medium might not be a bad choice and can carry decent size stuff.

HI, The cross Strap is stored in the inside pocket of the bag. So if you open the bag, you will find a zipper. Open that and the cross strap is inside that compartment. Thats how i found out.
I don't carry a laptop all the time too and have been using this as my main bag for traveling as I pack one or two days of clothing inside. . I would recommend using a Grid-It organizer with this bag for smaller stuff like chargers etc.
I finally went to rei to see them in person and i don't believe the x-small will fit a 13" macbook but a small will
it poured yesterday here in NYC and I was walking in the rain about 6 block to my car with no umbrella. The contents in my bag where still dry. It does a good job I would say. I had 10 manilla envelopes in my bag and none were affected by water.
Medium size I don't think so. I would say 15" max.

I think it's too small. I am 6 feet and it does look small. But I wanted a small bag. So it depends what u want to carry in the bag, that's more important question. Medium might not be a bad choice and can carry decent size stuff.

HI, The cross Strap is stored in the inside pocket of the bag. So if you open the bag, you will find a zipper. Open that and the cross strap is inside that compartment. Thats how i found out.
I don't carry a laptop all the time too and have been using this as my main bag for traveling as I pack one or two days of clothing inside. . I would recommend using a Grid-It organizer with this bag for smaller stuff like chargers etc.
I finally went to rei to see them in person and i don't believe the x-small will fit a 13" macbook but a small will
it poured yesterday here in NYC and I was walking in the rain about 6 block to my car with no umbrella. The contents in my bag where still dry. It does a good job I would say. I had 10 manilla envelopes in my bag and none were affected by water.
Medium size I don't think so. I would say 15" max.
There's no way to choose a left-handed version that I am aware of. For people who don't see the difference, it would be on the other shoulder thus making the napoleon pocket much harder to access as well as possibly the strap adjustment.

Update: I decided to talk with one of the guys in my hiking club before making the purchase, as he owns the older Kahtoolas. Initially we thought that the extra heel spikes weren't worth the extra money, since you lead & step off the ball of the foot, not the heel. Once on the snow & ice covered trails, however, we thought that the extra spikes could make a difference on some of the trickier descents, especially given my back issues. By the time I ordered the updated spikes on Dec. 19, the less expensive ones were temporarily not available in my size, so the price differential between the two styles became a moot issue. The vendor shipped them by priority mail, so they arrived on Christmas Eve. This was a plus, as I signed up for standard shipping, and did not expect my order that soon. I used my new Kahtoolas yesterday and am VERY pleased. No problems! At one point on the trail, many of my hiking cohorts sat on their backsides to slide down an icy rock. Using my trekking poles & new Kahtoolas, I stepped (albeit gingerly, because of my back) down the rock. My hiking buddies with Yak Trax do not have the stability or security that I experience with the Kahtoolas.
Yes - they work great on any slippery surface.
They are not climbing crampons, but do attach firmly to your boot. They worked very well in icy/muddy conditions, throw in loose gravel you have an added difficulty, but these are the best I have found.
Well I wish I could tell you definitively which ones to buy , but I'm not sure. I can tell you that I almost always wear a men's 12 boot and I have the large spike fit great. However I think that it might be better to go tighter as opposed to looser that way, they stay on better when stretched tight. Hope that helps, and definitely go with these as opposed to the cheaper coil versions, there is no comparison.

Yes, I have a size 8 and I'm on the lower side of their sizing guide for their medium. My friend on the other end is a sive 10 and also wears the mediums. The rubber is strong yet flexible and really wraps arround the boot. If it helps, I wear lowa renegades and my friend has a pair of vasque boots and ours both fit great. If you read my review you'll see I said the heal slipped a bit but I did have altitude sickness when I put them on and my hands were freezing, so basically is say it was user error on my part. So yes! They are true to size on their guide.
I had the same question. Based on REI's recommendation, and a quick search on Amazon's customer reviews, I chose the Medium.
Yes, buy them
a pair
I have a pair of large on 10 1/2 Vasque boots. The same pair barely fits a 10 sorel boot. If you are a borderline size it may be dependent on the shoe or boot that you're going to be wearing them with. The difference appears to be the size of the toe.

It might be a bit large and deep for a diaper bag. It would be to big for me to carry because I am only 4foot 10. My granddaughter who is 5 foot 3 uses it to carry everything she need for the day to school. I would think that the s shape straps make it more comfortable because they help distribute the weight better. I think the access to the outside pockets would be very helpful.
Yes. That is why I bought it. I like it better than the last one I had. This one holds more and lifts off the base for easier cleaning. I have only used it twice, so don't know how it will hold up. I use sunflower lecithin as I avoid soy in all forms.
2.5"
Yes. It does a great job cleaning coins.
The instructions that accompanied the product indicate items that can be cleaned include jewelry, eyeglasses, electric shaver heads, razor blades, dentures, combs, toothbrushes, CDs and DVDs.
Yes..........just glue them back on. Use SuperGlue Gel.
I never used it on brass, however, I have used it on gold, sterling, tungsten & cobalt, and it has work wonderful. However, on my gold over sterling, I think I left the rings in a little too long because they turned a little dark. However, I just buffed them with a polishing cloth and they were as good a new.
As far as I can tell, it's a straight 110.
I bought this for steeping e juice. To be honest and fair, if I had received one that actually did everything the description says mainly the timer options (mine only stayed on for 5 seconds) then I would probably be giving you an outstanding review because the sonic vibration is there, just couldn't make it stay vibrating for more than 5 seconds.
No reason why it won't work.
It is 8 inches wide, 7 inches deep and 6 inches high. Not exactly a counter item. I actually keep mine under the kitchen sink, next to a pickle jar filled with cleaning liquid. I clean the jewelry and then rinse it off with my WaterPik, which gets into crevices better than a sonic cleaner. So between the two actions my jewelry is better looking than when I got it at the store!
The basket size is right about 5 3/4 by 5"... They prob won't go in flat, but might do if leaning slightly. I have never cleaned glasses in here, but it brings the jewellery up sparkling clean
Yes
No. It's 110/120 only for the U.S. market.
Yes the Ivation IVUC96W Digital can clean silver & gold. Use coution for jewelry with stones. All Ultrasonic cleaners can cause stones to come loose! Use lowest power setting for jewelry w/stones!!
this is a great machine. I use it, mainly for cleaning my E-Cig stuff, but water and wood isn't a good combination, how ever I don't think it would trash it on a short setting, if you have one that's not important. What the heck. I have an old harp, might have to try in, It would surely need cleaned. Great cleaner simple to use. If it doesn't work for this you will find another use and your money won't be wasted. LOL GBTM
Hi J I have cleaned white gold and platinum with this unit. It leaned both metals and diamond really nicely. I used a little bit (and I mean maybe half a drop) of a grease cutting dish detergent to help with the cleaning. I hope this helps you.
I use either hot water only or hot water with a couple drops of dish detergent and it does the job.
No but you can clean glasses and sun glasses.
Never tried emeralds, so I can't say for sure
Cleans but will not polish added a little dawn to water.
large. my son wears a 9-1/2 shoe and they fit him perfect. buy two pair or more theyre nice
Men Size 9-11
One pair. But, they are probably the most comfortable socks I have ever owned.

what size is medium
I don't know. I would think so but I returned mine. I wanted to use them at work and had assumed I could walk in them. You can't or at least its very awkward. Also, the beads did not surround my foot like I wanted but gravity pulled them all down to the bottom of the slipper. Good product, just not exactly what I was looking for.
Some kind of tiny beads very slippery I was not impressed don't stsy hot that long
some type of "beads" are in the slipper to hold the heat. It holds heat for a short time - and they are hard to walk in the slippers, but do the job I needed them to do.
Hi, This item is Polyester material. Thank You, Lily's Home Customer Service
Hi, This item is not scented by herbs. Thank You, Lily's Home Customer Service
these fit perfect on my glasses and on my hubby's glasses. We do not have the same design - however are lenses are not large or round. I don't know the measurements exactly because I keep them in the car. It is amazing the difference the yellow lenses make. The WORK to help with light glare at night. They clip on very easy - no issues!
Well, i do not know whether it really blocks out blue spectrum light, instead i'm sure it protect your eyes somehow...
No but they are very useful on cloudy days and for night driving.I might add they are great for shooting skeet on cloudy days. I have been using them since I was in the Marines 50 years ago . They are worth the price. Prescription glasses are available however if you have glasses the clip on work well and can be purchased on line for $5.00
They are not heavy. I own a pair. But they are not as advertised, they really don't work.
Yes.It is Polarized Glasses.Thanks
Yes, I can wear them in the daytime. I don't recommend them if it's really bright outside as the glasses are obviously meant to enhance brightness. But if it is partly cloudy to fully cloudy, they are great. Oh and especially helpful at sunrise and sunset when your eyes are trying to adjust for either more dark or more light and can't.
yes they do, its actually how i use them. they clip good to your prescription glasses.
I don't see why not.........it is heavy so it must me mounted or held in place in the wall.
No.
No, just to hang on the wall. I do not recommend this to be hanged on a door, since it is very heavy.
Yes it's green, a very dark green!
The product description says 39 pounds.
A bit more than 90 degrees.
40LBS
the key and the lock comes with the armoire. You may be able to find a lock and key to fit the armoire.
The one we received was real wood with a nice finish.
It is 2 inches from the chain loop top to bottom of the cross. It is very detailed and suitable for male or female.
About 32 inches.
No ,it's 21 inches long.Donna
I don't think it's that long. The cross is big and really nice but the chain isn't that long.
Yes
The backpack and lunch box each have only one zipper to close them. They are good quality. This was a gift for my nephew and he has stuffed them full without any problems closing.
Yes
Yes, it's insulated.
I have small head, and the garment is snug.
Yes it will tuck under chin
Yes
I don't think so its a shorter neck and the mask is made out of like a spandex material. So the neck opening will ride up a little
Yes. I've washed & dried it with no problems.
no
It is very thin, so it might work. I wear such a balaclava for windsurfing in summer, but that is for warmth.
Yes. I pull the garment over my chin but not over my mouth or nose. Combined with a wind-proof neck gator, the head gear keeps me warm when I ride in temperatures in the upper 20s (below that, I drive my car). It is important to leave no gap under the full-face helmet, so one's neck is totally covered. The windproof neck gator is key.

My daughter has the youth size of the daisy print hat and it has the long strap, not the chin strap as shown in the picture. I am guessing that the picture shows the chin strap because that is for the younger kids.
1 hat
Yes it has a strap that goes under the chin which is adjustable.
Yes they have men's also. It should be made the same as the toddler. It is a great hat for wearing in the pool and outdoors. Maintains it shape with all activity, washing and packing. Future plans to buy more.
Sunday afternoon's play hat is great. provided excellent protection from the Sun and fit well. You can also adjust the hat with the pull string. Don't know anything about iplays.
Mine does crease, but I was able to shape it. I don't have it with me right now it's packed in a box but I am pretty sure the front bim is the only part that is shaped, so if you fold it front to back, in staff of side to side you don't have to crease the bill.
no! It is water repellant.
light weight nylon with built-in sun protection.
Not in the infant model that I got.
There is a size chart on Sunday Afternoons website. You need to measure your 11month old and determine which size you require.
My son wears a size 3 in youth. I ordered him Youth Small and they fit perfectly. I do wish there was a more accurate way to know you are ordering the correct size. But I guessed at it and it worked out for us. And the best thing about Amazon is, if it doesn't fit, you can easily exchange for a different size. I hope this helps!!
No. Just the one pair.
I would say no because they run a little small. My son wears a 12 and they are a little tight on him. Hope this helps
My son is 5'2" and they come to the middle of his shin. The large ones, so I don't think so.
definitely. seems like a breathable sock
They are definitely not that long, they won't go to or above your knee
I bought these in medium to fit my daughter who wears a size 8 in women's. They fit her well and are a bit tight to get on. Hope this helps!
Hello My son wears these socks when he plays football. They have slight padding for protection at the heel. They are snug and supportive and offer mild compression, especially at the arch. Hope this helps.
Largest size! They are tight
They are not sport specific. You can use them for baseball but they are not made from that hard material that baseball socks usually are made from.

They are not sport specific. You can use them for baseball but they are not made from that hard material that baseball socks usually are made from.
My son wears a size 3 in youth. I ordered him Youth Small and they fit perfectly. I do wish there was a more accurate way to know you are ordering the correct size. But I guessed at it and it worked out for us. And the best thing about Amazon is, if it doesn't fit, you can easily exchange for a different size. I hope this helps!!
No. Just the one pair.
I would say no because they run a little small. My son wears a 12 and they are a little tight on him. Hope this helps
My son is 5'2" and they come to the middle of his shin. The large ones, so I don't think so.
definitely. seems like a breathable sock
They are definitely not that long, they won't go to or above your knee
I bought these in medium to fit my daughter who wears a size 8 in women's. They fit her well and are a bit tight to get on. Hope this helps!

I bought these in medium to fit my daughter who wears a size 8 in women's. They fit her well and are a bit tight to get on. Hope this helps!
Hello My son wears these socks when he plays football. They have slight padding for protection at the heel. They are snug and supportive and offer mild compression, especially at the arch. Hope this helps.
Largest size! They are tight
They are not sport specific. You can use them for baseball but they are not made from that hard material that baseball socks usually are made from.
My son wears a size 3 in youth. I ordered him Youth Small and they fit perfectly. I do wish there was a more accurate way to know you are ordering the correct size. But I guessed at it and it worked out for us. And the best thing about Amazon is, if it doesn't fit, you can easily exchange for a different size. I hope this helps!!
No. Just the one pair.
I would say no because they run a little small. My son wears a 12 and they are a little tight on him. Hope this helps
My son is 5'2" and they come to the middle of his shin. The large ones, so I don't think so.

Injini web site has a sizing chart: (here is the US size info) small / medium / large M - 5-7.5 / 8-10.5 / 11-13 W - 6-8.5 / 9-11.5 / 12+
Yes, these toe socks are awesome. I have never had any foot or blister problems since I have started wearing them, even with wearing new shoes all day. They are very comfortable.
I'd say medium should work for you. I wear a size 5 shoe and the small fits me well.
I would use this as a liner
My size is 8 in women's and I always get small
Hi Jehlen, These are good for wicking away sweat, also since fingers are in thin cloth, it gives protection from blisters too and super comfy. But they are not compression.
Click on a few of the different sellers of these socks. Some of them have a link to a table that converts shoe sizes to sock size. Sorry couldn't provide you the answer. The link doesn't appear when using a phone to access amazon.
i am Male 42 Vibram 42 Show size i wear Large socks. If that helps
a tad bit small. they also can shrink in the wash a little bit
I think yes. You might have too much room in the toes if you go with a medium.

Would be a very tight fit, no room then for much else. If that is what you have to have might want to go a little bigger bag.
Maybe a 2L camelback pouch. There's no hole for it, so the house would have to come out of the top of the bag.
Yes but there's a slot for smaller laptops that it won't fit in on the inside. It can fit, but just loosely in there. I still use it. It's a pretty awesome bag, only downfall is that the zippers teeth feel like shark teeth.
It is not. I carry my iPod wallet keys and small lunch and water bottle and some stuff for kids to have in side pocket. Its not huge like my kids book bags.
Sadly No its not waterproof. I recommend you put your valuables in a sealed tight bag if your going to be around water just to be safe.
its more of a camo green. Faded, washed green.
Snap.
OK.I Prepare to take photo to you. Thank you.
No. Don't have a laptop compartment.
It's definitely more green than grey; if anything, it's like a khaki green? Similar to this: http://rlv.zcache.com/dark_greyed_camo_army_green_khaki_color_only_dryeraseboard-r3e42297fe05c45f881b4f6b2013bb428_fumjv_8byvr_324.jpg
I have worn these for years. Technically I should wear a small for my women's size 8, but found that when I wore them , they were popping off as I walked and I was losing one every few walks. I bumped it up to a medium and never experience this issue any longer and the medium fit well.
I did some research on the YakTrax site and it looks like there are Pro and Extreme versions that would be more suited for hiking. I am a hiker so I was considering these but now I'm thinking that I should get one of the other versions.
I am no shoe size expert but I can tell you that the medium Yaktrax fits my size 9 shoe perfectly.
Probably not...buying a size up is a good idea. I bought the recommended chart-size for myself and they did not fit, had to bey the next size up (men's).
I have the model that has coils rather than cleats. Sorry.

Athletic fit (slim)
I would get the small, my nephew is 7 and I bought him the medium and it's a little big
Fits true to size.
It might just be a amazon glitch but if the product says boys then consider the size youth
At the time I bought these shoes, my daughter was like a 10-11 shor size and these shoes were way too small on her.
I don't know the dimensions of the shoe. I can tell you I bought these for my 5 year-old grand daughter and they were extremely to small, she could barely get her foot in it.
These are hard plastic base with a jelly upper. My daughter scuffs around in them around the house but I wouldn't think they'd be Disney material. I'd say they're definitely made for play and they are hard to keep on the feet.
They fit my 2.5 yr old who is about a size 7. Prob fits most toddlers but not 6 yr olds.
My daughter is a size 12 shoe and these shoes do not fit at all, but she still has fun playing dress up with them even though they don't fit.
They fit my grand daughter and she wears a size 10 shoe but has very narrow feet.
Sorry these shoes do not have a size .9
The package it say 3 to 4 years I don't know about the size
Nope. That is not true , it is the light up shoes that cost so much .
The shoes do not come in sizes , they are about 8 inch from heel to toe.
Please see my review regarding the danger of this item.
My little girl wears size 9, she's 4 1/2 . They fit her perfectly fine, with a little room to spare, she can get them on and keep them on but they'll fit her for a while
Yes they do, I would estimate 1-2 inches max.
The shoe does not have sizes it is 8 inch for heel to toe.
I'm not sure but they were too little for my 5 year old granddaughter!
yes.
Yes but the charger is included
It may depend on the brand of phone you have. I bought my E`-Thinker to use with my IPhone. Unfortunately, it will not pair with the IPhone. I think it is designed to work with Android phones and I do not know about any other.
hello, there is no bluetooth in blackberry 10, so it can not work with blackberry 10, the interface is in English.
I don't know because I Dont own that kind of phone but it should if you have blue tooth on your phone.
This bluetooth bracelet can display caller's name and phone number if the caller's information is in phone book, it can only show phone number if stranger is calling. In addition, it can also vibrate and show the message your phone received, but you can not read the content of the message. it can vibrate to alert you that you forget your phone or lose your phone if the bluetooth distance between phone and bracelet is over 10 meters.
Not sure the model of your Blackberry, but it can work with any mobile phone with bluetooth inside.
Yes my father has it on his Iphone 5c it just take a bit more to setup but it does work.
The diameter is 2.7 inch, you can not adjust it for bgger wrists.
If you bought "E-THINKER" bluetooth bracelet from "E-THINKER" shop, there is additional operation of how to syn with phone book, other sellers do not provide clear instruction.
I don't know if it can or not, but I thought it was a horrible product and I returned it almost as soon as I got it. Very difficult to use, and the instructions were written in very poor English, as if translated from Chinese. Also, it only showed the time in 24-hour format. Call me picky, but I prefer 12-hour format. Hope this helps.
Yes, it can connect to Nexus 5 phone, there is bluetooth inside this phone.
Yes, it can be used with Galaxy note 3.
Yes
Sorry, I'm not entirely sure what to use. You can try nail polish remover, it might get the paint off without damaging the silver. If the silver is close to the white paint, I recommend using a Q-tip.
no
25 millimeters wide and length is 40 mm
Yes through 3rd party extensions.
You still have to use your phone for calls........BUT if you have a Bluetooth device. You can initiate calls from the watch.
is it compatible with Samsung avant
Yes it is. Works great with the phone.
It does have an accelerometer and it's used in some of the apps.
OMG I've had the Smart watch since early December and I wear it like almost everyday...so I charge it up at the beginning of the day like 6am. I work 12hr a day and it has never died before my shift actually it last longer than I expected. I text all day also. So if it last a text savy person like myself I'm sure you will love it. I do :)
Absolutely YES! That is how I use mine! It may be that different phones have different attributes. However with my Droid HD Max, I have both Bluetooth headset and the Smart Watch paired and operating at the same time, all the time. The phone never leaves my pocket!
No. It's just a bluetooth notifications screen. You can make a call on this watch but the call will be happening on the phone not the watch (the watch is just a dialer) If someone is calling you can check who is calling but you have to answer on the phone. This is different than the galaxy gear where you can actually have a conversation on the watch itself.
No, it works only for Android. Not for iPhone and not for Windows.
I don't know, I bought it for my Xperia Z1
I don't have a measuring utensil on me and I am on my way out the door, but it is a good size and it holds a lot of bracelets. It looks just like a holder you would see in a boutique or a fancy department store. It is a great decorative and organizational piece that has been worth the price. I see it lasting me for a long time as well. It is about a foot tall. the bottom row goes about approximately 5 inches on each side and each tier going up to the top extends about an inch less following suit.
sure..the rows aren't right over each other. You might have to double or put smaller head bands on the bottom row since it is lower.
Longest arm is 14" and from bottom of base to top of top bar around 14". So 14"x14". Holds a ton of bracelets and watches.
About 1 1/2" to 1 5/8" and all the same size.
Yes, it has engraved on the back: TM&2013 Lionsgate
It's about two inches is diameter. Same size as the first movie's pin.
We received the one shown. (I purchased it in early January)
Yes, I have one on my purse currently.
Yes
Its made of metal with a bronze tone. Very high quality. If i was selling it, I would of asked more for it. You wont be sorry. $12.00 is to much in my opinion...good luck....
The first one is model of the logo on the front of the first book and this is a model from the front of the second book. It shows then progression of Katniss as the Mockingjay
Hi Bonnie, it is the same as the first one, like a pimpom ball
it is metal with a bronze tone
Yes it is.
Yes I wear size 6 jeans and I bought size 6 UA pants
Definitely will do well in the dirt. The material is between medium and heavy-duty. Very durable and comfy! Not too much ventilation though--I used them while in equatorial Africa and survived, but was a bit hot.
I have the duty pants and they aren't that low. I can't stand low riding pants, but these seem to keep me covered whenever I squat or bend over. I wear mine about an inch below my belly button (im 6 foot and have a pretty long torso though). Hope this helps!
I believe they are about 31". For reference, I'm 5'5 and when I wear them with my converse the back drags just a tiny bit. However, if I wear them with my boots or any shoe with a bit of sole, they sit on the back of the shoe and don't drag. These pants are awesome! Give them a try.
I ordered the size I wear in jeans. The pants give in the waist so I'd stick with my normal size
No idea exactly but it has elastene in it. It is very soft and smooth. But it will melt and is water resistant but very breathable. Also you can not use fabric softener with it.
The ones I purchased are size 12 and it's got a 31.5" inseam length. Hope it helps.
No the bottom of the legs aren't elastic.
No lol, there just not made for extreme heat, I laughed about that as well, but I haven't been set on fire with all the work I do, and we use torches lol, I wouldn't go setting myself on fire to see what happens but all is good! Hahaha

I don't know if this helps, but: https://www.americanapparel.net/sizing/default.asp?chart=womens.pants and also there is this one: http://www.womenssizechart.com/ now turn inches to CM by: 1inch = 2.54CM Regards!!!!
Yes I wear size 6 jeans and I bought size 6 UA pants
Definitely will do well in the dirt. The material is between medium and heavy-duty. Very durable and comfy! Not too much ventilation though--I used them while in equatorial Africa and survived, but was a bit hot.
I have the duty pants and they aren't that low. I can't stand low riding pants, but these seem to keep me covered whenever I squat or bend over. I wear mine about an inch below my belly button (im 6 foot and have a pretty long torso though). Hope this helps!
I believe they are about 31". For reference, I'm 5'5 and when I wear them with my converse the back drags just a tiny bit. However, if I wear them with my boots or any shoe with a bit of sole, they sit on the back of the shoe and don't drag. These pants are awesome! Give them a try.
I ordered the size I wear in jeans. The pants give in the waist so I'd stick with my normal size
No idea exactly but it has elastene in it. It is very soft and smooth. But it will melt and is water resistant but very breathable. Also you can not use fabric softener with it.
The ones I purchased are size 12 and it's got a 31.5" inseam length. Hope it helps.

Yes they are all 5/6
My daughter wears 5t and it fit her perfectly. It will probably be a bit big for a 2 yr old, esp if she isn't wearing it over other clothing.
4-6X
It is about 4-6. Sized like other Disney dress-up play clothes.
Not normal ones but if u could print one on a sticker or something with an adhesive back u could.
yes just like in the movie
No, we do not ship outside the continental US.
The outside is made of metal but the inside is made of plastic. Hope this helps
It should... I have ATT though... The OS for it requires a Galaxy S4 or Note so keep that in mind... It may also work with the S3 but I would research it more... Best Buy has a Samsung Team pushing them and they should be able to help you...
Yes, ever update make the gear better and more simple to use. I'm really enjoying my gear.
Not yet. Right now just some samsung phones. With 4.3. There is a hack for the Nexus 5, but that's it
you can use the watch on its own yes, just need a phone to set the clock up how you want it. You do lose phone function, so no calls or text. you can still take pictures and movies from it.
Yes
It's design to work with the note but contact your carrier.
Si
I found a solution at http://www.samsung.com/us/support/faq/FAQ00057152/74050/
My friend tried it with his S5 and it didn't seem to work. He was told the new Gear 2 would be compatible with the S5.
Watch, charging cradle, charging cord, owners manual. Basic stuff.
yes
IP55 protects against dust and water like rain or a splash or spill. It will not work if you immerse or submerge it in water.
Yes
Yes it does
I'm pretty sure it does, because I heard that the s3 got Android 4.3 update. Check your phone info and if your Android version is 4.3 then the watch will work with it.
Yes it does BUT you need to upgrade your OS to Jelly Bean 4.3 and then install Galaxy Gear App from Play. All devices who can upgrade to 4.3 can use the Galaxy Gear.
I just upgraded from an S3 to the new S5 phone at my local Sprint store. The sales rep was extremely knowledgeable and assured me that the watch is totally compatible with the S4, S5 and Note 4 so yes, absolutely!
Doesn't need to be showered, just wipe it clean with a lint free cloth.
To use the watch you can use the watch without your phone it will just be a standard watch but to connect it to your phone yes the phone and watch has be with him 50 or so feet away from each other
The pictures and videos automatically beam to your phone everytime you take one so memory on the watch is not an issue. Also the camera Works way better than I thought it would. If you have kids or dogs you will love it. And now I take way more videos because it's so convenient
Yes
originally designed to work only with the Note 3, it now officially works with the S4.
It does with a small tweak to the standard options of the gear manager.
It will not read the messages aloud to you(like using text to speech) but it will display the message. You can send a text using S Voice to do speech to text which works fairly well or you can use predetermined replies that you can add your own canned replies to and then you may select one of those to send as a text. You cannot currently type a reply on the watch. I find that if you have some good canned replies that it is typically all you need for a quick reply.
I had a head set that I would wear when driving. Now it is as simple as saying "answer". Sound quality on my end is like a speaker phone on the other end is similar to blue tooth. It has two microphones with noise cancelation so that is nice. even today I was walking into the FedEx store carrying my huge parcel and I got a phone call I was able to answer it and let them know I'll call them back pretty seamlessly without dropping my parcel that weighed 21 pounds. I hope that helps.
Yes, the phone needs to be within a few feet of you for the Gear to work.
As of 2 days ago.....It now works with the Note 2 on Verizon! Yay!
Yes
Yes it does just bought one for my Samsung s5 Verizon wireless
Only certain Samsung Galaxy phones
Of course... i do :)
turns off and activates with movement of your wrist
Yes it has vibrate for alerts
The S5 will work, it doesn't matter who the carrier is, my wife has AT&T
I wish it did, but unfortunately it does not.
Yes
No more that 25 to 30 feet
Hey Gary, I know that they come in different colors and that if you wanted to change bands I would ask someone at the Samsung store or Best Buys to see if they carry the bands &#8986;&#65039;
Yes your good as long as you have 4.3
No
Yes the device is actually compatible with the s3, s4, note2 and the note3
It's linked to your phone via blue tooth -has nothing to do with your phone plan
You can wash your hands if you are careful. However, do not get a shower or submerge it under water.
yes it is.
Yes that's what I was told from a Samsung rep.
it is compatible with devices running 4.3 or higher
Yes any smartphone with bluetoooth
DEVICE COMPATIBILITY Galaxy Gear is currently compatible with devices running 4.3 or higher. Below is a list of devices by carrier: AT&T Samsung Galaxy Note 3, SM-N900A Samsung Galaxy S 4, SGH-i337 Samsung Galaxy S III, SGH-i747 Samsung Galaxy Mega, SGH-i527 Sprint Samsung Galaxy Note 3, SM-N900 Samsung Galaxy S 4, SPH-L720 Samsung Galaxy Note II, SPH-L900 Samsung Galaxy S III, SPH-L710 T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy Note 3, SM-N900T Samsung Galaxy S 4, SGH-M919 Samsung Galaxy S III, SGH-T999/T999L Verizon Samsung Galaxy Note 3, SM-N900V Samsung Galaxy S 4, SCH-i545 Samsung Galaxy S III, SCH-i535 Samsung Galaxy Note II, SCH-i605 Samsung Galaxy S 4 Mini, SCH-i435 U.S. Cellular Samsung Galaxy Note 3, SM-N900RA Samsung Galaxy S 4, SCH-R970 Samsung Galaxy Note II, SCH-R950 Samsung Galaxy S III, SCH-R530
yes it is,works great with al samsung phones,easy to pair-you will forget about your phone with bluetooth enabled
Yes, the phone that I have and use with the watch is the samsung 5.
There might be a way, however it only works with the Note 3 and S4 as advertised. There is a $10 app that will allow you to use it with other phones, but likely not as good as the Samsung gear manager.
11/27/2013 yes and it will work with Galaxy 3, and 4. As of today it still will not work with Galaxy 4 mini but i've been told it will eventually.
Yes, it comes with a proprietary charger. 110v ~ 240v supported.
Yes. When my husband talks to me through the watch it is more clear than using speaker phone. It is actually so clear that many times I don't even realize he is using his watch.
Perfect !
It is my understanding it works with any carrier. The only requirement is the operating system, 4.3 and s-beam/Bluetooth connectivity that should be on your phone already and not disabled. I would assume Verizon allows these functions.
I am not sure of this because our contract is not due for an update until next month as we have a Galaxy s2 but from my understanding it should work with this watch. Sorry I could not more specific. Thanks
To best understanding... NO not with GS3
Yes
Yes
Medium
I'm 5'10", 165 and I have the Medium size
Super light weight - thin fabric but good sturdy fabric. This is excellent comprsssion gear.
My waist is on the upper end of the mediums and they fit. Since your waist is on the upper end of the large, large should be fine unless of course you have unusually thick thighs. Large will be long though.
I am 6'1" and there is plenty more leg length on the medium size. Thigh muscle size and glute muscle size will determine whether or not a large would be required over medium. I have a smaller bum and thighs so medium works great for me.
I live in California and I wear these year round.
Large ... these may be too narrow / tight as they are snug on me (waist 34", 6'3").
My husband says stick with the large! He's very similar to you in height and weight!
I wea the 34" as well, but am only 5'9". I think it depends on what the next size is? They fit snug. If you are thin go with the 34.

Yes
it is high quliaty , which fullfilled by amazon. only two days delivery.Thank you!
The largest compartment is 9 inches deep by 8 inches wide. It could accommodate a 9x8 book that is about two inches thick. There is a second compartment that is roughly 8 inches deep by 6 inches wide, and about one inch thick. In addition, you have about five other pockets and slots ranging from tiny to fairly large.
The straps are nylon web with PVC leather (man made) ends sewn in. No real leather on this bag. But the bag is well made, very comfortable to wear and looks great! I have had a couple of guys ask where they can buy one. One dude said he was looking for a bag that wasn't girlie looking and said this bag was what a man's carry bag should look like. I can honestly recommend this bag. I am pleased with mine. I have been using on occasion for about 2 months with no issues.
Yes it would, it's small but holds a lot.
I believe an iPad air will fit it, but it will not fit a 13" Mac Book Pro w/retina Display.
I personally think if you put things in it and with the weight of the bag it might be too heavy for a child. I can't answer whether it will adjust to your boy's size since I don't know how tall is the boy.
Well not to sure how big is big ? Its plenty long for me but I am only 5"6 but I am heavy at 200lbs
I think diagnolly. It was a gift to a friend. And I know is that he likes it a lot.
Not very, but it's useful and well-built.
Sorry but I don't know it was gift to a friend.
It is all Denim.. No leather on this model.
No. I looked at several on Amazon. Some had charts others didn't. Since I preferred this style, I took a chance and went with the 2X. It is a perfect fit. I am 6'3" and weigh about 255. Depending on the item, sometimes 2X is fine and sometimes a little loose.
They run a little big, but they are designed to fit over a jacket. I wear an xl. Over a jacket is perfect, however, is a little big over a tshirt.
I'm 6'2" 245 and I have plenty of room in this vest.
Sure.
Sorry I only have Rose gold with 4 cubic zirconia stones left.
yes it has the engraving. no difference both listing.
Yes I have. Just order this and message me after placing order
Diameter 60mm. Length 170mm
This one with gift box. The product is exactly the same as picture shows
Yes. With the screw driver
yes it is has the engraving.
if you need,i can send it with for free.
yes it is
What works best for me is to insert a finger nail into the clasp opening which causes the clasp to open. This is also the method used in a store that I visited.
Tes it is
The one I recieved did NOT come in a Pandora box but instead of a little clear baggie.
Yes, my wife loves it and it fit her just right once all the charms were put on it.
Did not come come with charm. I believe it is Pandora.
Charms about 20 without being uncomfortable to wear. That does not include spacers.
no
You need to measure her wrist. That will tell you the size.
mine did but I did read a review where it didn't
Yes
3 easily
Of course - if you use a hanger BUT IMO this is a terrible product - tore on 1st use & I bought 2 ... a waste of money.
This bag does not have a latch. I love the bag but probably not the best option if your going to use it for daily traveling. The material is thin but it served it's purpose well for me.
A soft form of plastic
I have not taken it on a plane personally, but i will assume so.
I only bought one
Yes and a cd stand. Unit is higher powered than most.
I'm sure you can, but not certain as I've never done it. It cleans everything else.
Sure. It is powerful. I would start with the lowest setting and work your way up.
No it isn't. Cleaning is quite simple though. Just don't immerse or think you can throw it in the dishwasher.
Klies, The highest setting in minutes for this item is 10 min.
Why? What are you cleaning a jet engine. I believe 240s, much longer will take the paint off. J/k it is much more powerful than other , but a limited capacity.
I think so because I never weighed it. my wife wears it and feels extremely light, but I think it is suitable for spring and fall to wear.
This is the only thing I have in this brand, but it does not run as small as Patagonia. I am 5'4" 145lbs, and I got a Large. I bought it to wear in the winter over a down or heavy fleece layer, so I wanted a slightly larger size. It is roomy, but slim looking even over a t-shirt. I love the style, fit, & look of this jacket. I would think you would want a small or medium depending on what you plan on wearing underneath. Either way, it will not look like like a sac! Good luck!
I don't know the answer to your question, but I have kept dry at horse shows in flooding rains! Great fit, great look, waterproof, & tough.
Yes. It fits me and I kinda have a bigger head too. Really cute! Surprisingly cute!
Hello, in this case we suggest you send a email to us. Our customer service staff will send the picture to you within 24 hours. Thanks.
Yes black wool. It almost looks like thick felt in person.
25 inches when the drawstring isn't tightened at all and around 17 when it is pulled all the way.
It is actually glued down
Yes :/ this hat is more like a m/L
No, mine didn't. I believe it's an option
My understanding is that Qualcomm (the maker) only intends for it to be sold in the U.S. right now. I've seen comments from them a couple of times on Twitter about assessing expanding the range to additional countries. You can obviously theoretically get someone else to sell it to you out of the country (I have no idea if it's possible to get the Toq app from another country's version of the Google Play store or if you'd have to use some kind of workaround, though. I'm guessing you should check on that.) Still, even if you got it out of the country, I'd be worried about what kind of support you could access if something went wrong with it, given that the manufacturer who'd be dealing with a warranty claim would know that they weren't selling it outside the U.S. at the time. The safest thing for now is probably to write to them and make sure they know that you'd like to be able to buy it somewhere else.
Don't buy this.. You will regret..
It works with Pandora, Spotify and other music apps. I don't have your running app but it doesn't interact, aside from notifications, with any of my running apps.
Dear it supports only English language. Also check with Amazon . Thanks
Yes you can set it to dusplay in Celsius
Yes they will work fine together. But don't bother. Unless you REALLY want the Mirasol screen & don't mind it faulting within a week.
As of Feb 2014 They were not released from Qualcomm yet.
It's always on. Great in the sunlight.
No
Idk... sorry
No, not on most normal sized fingers. Don't get this anyway. It's crap.
Yes, most likely
No, this style is only for people who wear contacts or do not wear glasses.
Yes, because the glasses make the lights appear yellow, it softens the effects of bright headlights and streetlight glare.
I wear them during the day if I'm driving on the freeway. They make everything look brighter and clearer. And if it's overcast they really make a difference. I'm glad I bought them. (I haven't driven at night since I got them, so I don't know how they are for night driving.)
Just get the clip ons and put them on a pair of glasses that fit him.
No we don't ship international
one
Yes, we ship USPS
I don't specifically know the answer to your question... all i can say is that the one i purchased works as advertised. The only thing you could do is purchase a pair of both and have then assessed for quality lense grinding by your eye profesdional. Research Amazon products... they show several... then read all of the ratings. Hope these friendly suggestions are helpful.
The package includes 1 pair of glasses.
I don't think so - these were pretty inexpensive - there are more expensive pairs with scratch resistance and polarization - about $10 more a pair -
I would suggest an extra small. I purchased the medium and I am 5'5" and weigh 150, narrow hips... and it fits fine... I prefer a shorter skirt for my running and biking needs... so I ordered a two more colors in small... but they all fit almost the same.... because the skirt has a VERY forgiving elastic super stretchy waistband. Not that your daughter would need it... but just in case you are concerned about it being EXTRA small. I'd still suggest the smallest size for her because the waistband is super stretchy. Good luck! They are gorgeous skirts! :-)
The waistbands are SUPER stretchy. So base your size on their hip measurements. And don't order up! If it says a small will fit, order the small. Otherwise it will be too big.
No. It is just decorative bling to wear racing. It's very light and non intrusive
Small
I'm 5'5 and if I put it on my hips, the skirt passes the "hands at your sides" length test, coming about three to four inches above the knee, so it may be a little short. It is very see through, though, and you definitely won't be able to wear it with nothing underneath. I wear it with leggings and it's great!

All of the measurements for SparkleAthletic skirts are on their website. I will give the URL here but Amazon strangely seems to delete URLs. The sizes are very "forgiving." If the runner is super slender or a chunky monkey, the skirts just flow and cover Mother Nature's flaws, while accentuating the positive! :) http://sparkleathletic.com/blogs/skirt-sizing-fit-details/ I could help you more specifically if you told me what size you wear in jeans, running tights, or shorts.

The waistbands are SUPER stretchy. So base your size on their hip measurements. And don't order up! If it says a small will fit, order the small. Otherwise it will be too big.
No. It is just decorative bling to wear racing. It's very light and non intrusive
Small
I'm 5'5 and if I put it on my hips, the skirt passes the "hands at your sides" length test, coming about three to four inches above the knee, so it may be a little short. It is very see through, though, and you definitely won't be able to wear it with nothing underneath. I wear it with leggings and it's great!

All of the measurements for SparkleAthletic skirts are on their website. I will give the URL here but Amazon strangely seems to delete URLs. The sizes are very "forgiving." If the runner is super slender or a chunky monkey, the skirts just flow and cover Mother Nature's flaws, while accentuating the positive! :) http://sparkleathletic.com/blogs/skirt-sizing-fit-details/ I could help you more specifically if you told me what size you wear in jeans, running tights, or shorts.
I would suggest an extra small. I purchased the medium and I am 5'5" and weigh 150, narrow hips... and it fits fine... I prefer a shorter skirt for my running and biking needs... so I ordered a two more colors in small... but they all fit almost the same.... because the skirt has a VERY forgiving elastic super stretchy waistband.

It doesn't work because it's a $4 watch, I bought it because I have an outfit to match!
About 1 of 12 that I have bought just don't work. You may have to return for an exchange.
Not that I'm aware of
I haven't had to change it yet. So I'm not sure. Sorry.
Don't buy from this seller!!!!! Wait until this item is available on the Disney website or the price goes down. These prices are way too expensive.
I agree. It's disgusting
Regardless, this dress has a list price of $49.95 from "the Disney store" NOT $300 plus. I just got one last week when they went back on sale (yes, they are sold out again but they will produce more) and JCP has many in stock now as well. They will get more dresses in, and when they finally catch up to the demand you my friend will no longer be able to price gouge and profit off of another company's legitimate hard work. Get a real job.
I don't know, but QVC has it for less than $40 and it has lights that twinkle on it.
My daughter has 5 years old and almost 50 inches. 7/8 fits perfectly!
You order directly from amazon prime and they will ship it to wherever you want it to go
This costume doesn't have gold or diamonds so why would you pay this crazy price! Wait till the stores stock up.
we are currently out of large but we will have more next season
Yes, I think you should go with large
Large would more than likely be best in this case
I would say XL

Yes you can have more stones - just let me know when you order what you need..thanks Dessa

You can not preview your custom order before purchase. These are unique to each person. Hope this helps. Thank you
It should works for once or twice. But would not recommend to hold the small laptop very often as this bag is thin and doesn't protect laptop well.
I'm reasonably certain that the product would support the weight but the straps have minimal padding. I think it would be pretty uncomfortable to carry that heavy of a payload.
Approx 18 X 15 w 3 pocket s - holds a lot of things
china
I tried to fold it along the original lines smoothing the material, and then turned the pocket inside out over the folded backpack material....still a little lumpy but very packable, which is what I wanted.
No they just go on the left ear but as to the pain I think its going to hurt no matter what way you try to put them.
It's two of the same cuffs ( same color and same ear.) Without the clip-on piece. I've order two( gold then silver) at separate times and got the same results. In my opinion I don't think it is worth it. Because it wasn't the clip-on cuff I ordered either times.
No
appox 12 inches wide. approx 14 inches tall. I hope that helps
Yes, it has a zipper (mine broke after a few days of wearing the bag; maybe yours will fare better!). It has two compartments inside. One is a small pouch with a zipper, and the other is a small open pouch for you to slip things into easily. Hope that helps.
It kind of smells leathery, but it's very stiff and it's creased slightly in a few spots after weeks of use..... So, not entirely sure. But for the price does it really matter?! I've gotten compliments on it so I'm happy.
That's not the description that was there when I purchased it and NO it is definitely NOT a men's messenger bag. It is exactly as the picture - just a tote.
Yes it can
Amazon-Fulfilled Inventory
Mine is pink & turquoise
I don't think so.
Yes....
The weight of the bag is really light. However I have to write another review because the zipper broke. So if you want a bag just for lip stick and your wallet is fine. But if you use it for lunch and books this bag is not for you!!!
Yes they are recessed and walking in them is no problem at all. When walking on gravel you can kinda feel the cleat touching but walking on side walks feels just like tennis shoes
I wear a 10 and ordered the 44 and they fit ok so a 45
I normally wear 10 1/2 also, but I don't like my toe against the shoe, so I prefer the 45.
43. You want size bigger than you wear for cycling shoes. They don't flex like regular shoes. Our feet flatten & spread out a bit
Not at all. Stepping on the peddle clips it in and a twist of the foot unclips it. Just make sure the clips on the shoe are tight. Carry an Allan wrench and every once in a while make sure that they do not get loose. If they get loose then the twisting will make the clip move and not release from the peddle.

Yes, definitely
We bought ours in January and one stap is broken (May) as well as the strap where you hang the bag. However, my son looover the back pack!
Yes the one that u received had adjustable sliding pads hope this message helps
The smaller front compartment is padded to protect the cars from being damaged from outside bumps; however the inside of the compartment is not padded. I wouldn't recommend this bag to carry an IPad unless it had its own protective carrying case.
I'm sorry...no idea but my son LOVES it!
Hi..definitely more rosey looking....i wear a silver tone with it at the same time...looks good...but I love mixed metals....good luck. ...
I don't think so it's relatively small
It's like an oval. It the perfect shape of your wrist. I definitely recommend it.
Dear brianna, Thank you for your contact. Yes,we shipped out your item at 21th July. As it is international shipment ,it will take 25-30 days. If shipment goes smoothly,it will arrive before estimated time. The fastest shipment is most expensive,we couldn't afford.Hope you can understand. Have nice day. Best Regards.

I bought an x large expecting it to bebaggy on me, but it fits me like a large. I'd advise you to buy a couple of sizes bigger than what you normally buy. Toodles.
I would say get a size bigger than your usual, it's better if the sweater fits you big rather than smaller
Make sure to wash it inside out if you going to do it by washer. I did mine in the washer by the black stuff faded out a bit. Also it didn't shrink or anything so that was the good thing.
They tend to run small so I always order x-L
No! I wash mine normally with my other whites and it's fine :)
I would consider this being a medium weight. It's not super heavy but it's lightweight either.
If she fits a small in American sized clothing, then it should be a little loose but comfortable.

The area around the waist runs smaller however the arms are very spacious.
I have a size medium and after several washings the sleeves are 25 inches from the shoulder seam to the cuff. Hope this helps!
This sweatshirt seems to be designed to fit at the waist. The band is fitted, really not stretchy. I also had to go up a size since this sweatshirt seems to be a slim cut through the torso. Even though I did reorder and go up a size it still is more snug at the waist, is not longer, but the upper chest and shoulders are much looser and the arms are bigger and longer. The sweatshirt does not seem to run long enough to reach mid-thigh, but that is just my own experience. I even thought I would just stretch it out after washing but there is really not much stretch. This might not work for you.
I dont think it comes in red - have seen the other colors but not red - there is a fleece that comes in red
Get the smallest size which is small . I'm 125lbs & the size small fits BIG ! But like I said I use it for work & it's pretty comfortable . Your 45KG this hoodie is going to fit super big on you :( maybe try a different style... Maybe the pullover

The area around the waist runs smaller however the arms are very spacious.
I have a size medium and after several washings the sleeves are 25 inches from the shoulder seam to the cuff. Hope this helps!
This sweatshirt seems to be designed to fit at the waist. The band is fitted, really not stretchy. I also had to go up a size since this sweatshirt seems to be a slim cut through the torso. Even though I did reorder and go up a size it still is more snug at the waist, is not longer, but the upper chest and shoulders are much looser and the arms are bigger and longer. The sweatshirt does not seem to run long enough to reach mid-thigh, but that is just my own experience. I even thought I would just stretch it out after washing but there is really not much stretch. This might not work for you.

I've had the watch for a few months now and love it. I haven't played around with the German detection feature yet but i expect it to be accurate. Fingers crossed for an updated version with an overall communist sensor as I reside in the People's Republic of New Jersey.
Nope, bought this watch and return it immediately everything about it is substandard
You have to go into settings. Button left button. You can turn on or off chime and or beep.
It does work. Needs calibration when new, but this just involves rotating the watch several times. I would not recommend it for precise measurements, but good enough for casual hiking. If you need serious guidance a precision compass is a better choice.
It's not great, I was worried at first, but if you tilt it up as you normally would to read a watch, it shows up adequately. If you glance down at your watch along your side, it can be difficult to read, but if you make the standard watch reading motion, you can see it fine. I would probably not get the reverse display again, but it is working fine for me.
So it doesn't rotate. But the digital campus moves when you have it up
No
I don't recall how many. But save your money. It's not very accurate.
It only has 2 time zones
I dont think you can. If its on your wrist the temp will be higher
Fits a 2-3 year old
I bought them for my 3 year old and she loves them. They are a little big for her but she doesn't mind. She just has to push them up occasionally.
YES :)
Yes!!!!
Yes definitely
Janan, I believe it will be a little short for your daughter as my son is about 5' and it is just about right for him. hope this help. Regards,
No there is not. Also the backpack without anything inside is pretty heavy on its own.
Compared to a backpack that I still own which did fit under a plane seat, it should. The wheel does not protrude much beyond the back of the backpack. I've not used it on a plane yet.
Yes it will, its actually fairly wide and pretty long, it also expands at the bottom. It fits about three to four dictionary sized texts books.
I don't think it would all fit comfortably. My 10 year old daughters schools books and lunch pale don't fit so I would recommend something bigger. Also, the zipper broke within a month of buying it. Id spend your money on something better.
We used it to go to Disney and on a cruise in May. At times it was pretty stuffed with books/guides, cameras, etc. At other times it was overstuffed with beach towels. It held up fine! This past week I used it again to carry a bunch of equipment for a computerized ID system, again it was overstuffed with cords, supplies, a laptop, chargers, etc. The only thing I'd caution you about is that it has no padding (other than the shoulder straps), so if you're carrying anything fragile you'll want to be careful how you pack it.
I think it would hold everything except the clothing.
Yes, one on each side of backpack.
I'm pretty sure you can put a camel back inside but the back-pack was not made for that.
I imagine it would
The bottom is the same as the rest of the bag. Nylon. I wouldn't think it will hold up if dragged
The size is stated on Amazon - 19" x 13.5" x 8.5".
Might be a bit big, depending on the child's height. Could also be much too heavy if filled to capacity, again, depending on the kid. I'm a 5'3" adult and when I was 9-10 years old this would have been huge for me.
it has a vibration mode so you'll feel the vibration in your wrist but for your phone you have to turn your phone to silent as well you also have to set up your watch for specific alerts but as long as you have it on vibrate for your watch and your phone you'll be good to go
Flawlessly. I have both and hardly have to pull out my phone anymore.
The watch has Nothing to do with your phone plan it's just an accessory for your phone
English only
Yes, so enjoy!
I returned it. The speaker quit working whenever I sweat even a little bit. And then finally quit working altogether.
No, it just checks your rate from your wrist.
Hi, you can add it to h.s. on gear 2. Go it apps on watch, and stopwatch is there, just hold s.w. then place it on h.s.
Yes it will still calculate steps even if your not hooked up to phone. When your connect with the phone all the data will update in your phone app.
My wrist is about 8 1/2 too and it was too tight for me. The good news is that the watch takes any 22mm sized band, so you can buy and fit another band, which is what I did - leather with rose gold deployant clasp. Samsung also markets its own leather band, not sure who stocks it, maybe Amazon.
Just search for watch bands here on Amazon, the key is looking for a 22mm lug size. I am not sure that Samsung is selling branded bands yet if that is what you meant.
This is the Neo model of Gear 2, it is cheaper mainly because it has no camera.
In short...... Yes, it should. In long...... I am a day and well, lets say 3/4's. I'm almost at 2 day's. I got the watch on Tuesday, fully charged it, put it on at 1pm. it has not left me since. I have used it fairly moderately. Made several calls. Tons of txts, Loads of notifications email/gmail/txt/calander/alarms. It has been connected to note 3 the entire time. I did power cycle it one time due to another issue. O, i did take it off for about 20 min while me and my wife got into the Hot Tub (i know its water proof, but didnt wanna risk the heat). While we where in the hot tub, i attached it to charging cradle. So Right now it is 1155 am Thursday, so lets call it a day and 23hours, and i have 70% battery. So in 2 day's with 1 power cycle, and 1 20-25 min charging session, i still have 70%. I think that is very reasonable. Now if i can get the one problem i am having straightened out, i will be good to go.
You can using your voice or canned responses. There is no keyboard.
Negative. The watch already has a heart rate monitor. You can display real time info when using the exercise function.
Not all of them. For example, playing music, pedometer, videos, pictures, exercising, and sleeping features, just to give you some examples, all of them are not dependent of the phone so you can use them while not having the phone close to you. Only apps that need live data, like notifications, are the ones that need the phone in order to operate.
I have a small wrist and there is not a lot of room to make it larger. You can change the band with ease, so you should be able to find one that will fit.
no, it will work with the phones, not the tablet, since it requires a phone service.
I have gotten my gear 2 neo wet and it has been just fine. As to being waterproof no, water resistant maybe .
No
The GEAR 2 has a camera w/metal bezel. The NEO has no camera w/plastic bezel. Both function the same otherwise. As for the first gen., I have that one now, & am attempting to get the new GEAR 2. The placement of the camera & speakers on the original are rather inconveniently on the strap, where they have been moved to the watch itself, making it easier for more personalization with either other Samsung bands or even your favorite other watchband. The GEAR 2 has a new operating system that is said to be 'better & faster' than the original's android, but the amount/quality of apps are still to be tested positive. Hope this helps! I think I covered everything that you were asking. If not, try calling your local BestBuy, or even your Cell phone carrier for more information. Just Don't call Samsung, they don't offer any reasonable assistance.
Yes, it has 4GB of space for storage and can play music without being paired to a phone. Bluetooth headphones will work.
You can view and reply to text messages as long as you are using Samsung's Messaging app. If you are using a third party messaging app, you can view it only. You can reply with a set of pre-defined messages that you can create, edit and delete. You can also reply with S Voice which is remarkably accurate when done in a quiet environment.
There's a "sleep" app that comes preloaded on it. I use it every single night.
The reports say that it should last 2-3 days.
The Galaxy Gear is the original watch that came out last fall. It's base operation system is Android. The Gear 2 and Gear Neo are the newest models. Notice that that Gear 2 and Gear Neo don't have the "Galaxy" prefix. They run an operation system called Tizen. The main differences between the Gear 2 and Gear Neo is that the the Gear 2 has a built in 2MP camera and has a metal body. The Gear Neo has a plastic body and no camera. So if you want one with all the bells and whistles, the Gear 2 is the newest one with the most features.
Yes, it has a speaker.
Yes, both at the same time. Once your phone rings, you can answer it with the Gear 2 or Bluetooth Headset or Phone.
It is IP67 meaning: dust proof and water resistant up to 3 feet deep for 30 minutes, so yes you can go swimming and wash your hands with it
I'm 5'4" with a pretty skinny wrist. Yes, it fits, with two or three holes left to go even smaller, but the watch alone, not counting the strap, extends all the way across the width of my arm. Instead of the strap wrapping around my wrist, there's actually some space under the top and bottom ends of the watch before the strap makes contact with skin. I just got it yesterday and so far it's distractingly large, but I think I will get used to it. It's no worse than those monstrously large watches everyone seems to be wearing these days. The functionality is awesome, I'm trying my best to convince myself that it's the wave of the future and pretty soon ALL the fashionistas will be wearing it. I'm going to post a photo for you to see.
It has potential to be very useful. For example, it allows me as a construction worker to not fumble around in my pocket when a call comes in. It also allows me to control the volume on my bluetooth music speaker. With better apps, it has the potential to be a lot more.
The fact that it takes more than 20 seconds on average to get a reading while requiring you to stand still, and does not display a continuous reading makes it unusable for me.
No, the device itself is not made to work on a carrier, you must have a compatible phone or tablet in order to use it with any of the call/email/text features. It is not the network it works with, it is the phone or tablet that you have.
The casing on the face is plastic on the Neo and metal on the Gear 2.
I have 2.5 GB free on mine. That should store 400-600 songs.
This watch does not have a camera. Look for gear 2 instead of gear 2 neo
It comes with a cradle that snaps onto the back of the watch. The cradle plugs in via micro-USB (charger also included)
I can only find one App called "Gear Maps" in the Samsung Gear Apps in the Gear Manager App on your connected phone. Can't find any suitable Apps in the Google Play Store that suggest they work with the Gear 2 Neo. The Gear Maps App is $2.00 and reading the info, It suggests it syncs the map on your phone to the watch. I did not try it so I can't say how good it works.
You can set the volume(the gear neo) to silent or vibrate, I learned this in youtube reviews.
No, the gear 2 neo can only connect to a bluetooth head set or a samsung galaxy device(only the supported ones).
Size 4.5 to 11.5 including half sizes
I use a polishing cloth and once a month cleaning solution. I recently had to have the tines tightened because the stone seemed loose and actually fell out.
You can send us a message at the time of your purchase or you can place your order and we will contact you in 24 hours asking about your size. We will send you 3 messages in the span of 3 days to conform your size. If we do not receive a response we will have to send out a random size Thank You
Its not cheap metal like nickel so it doesnt tarnish
What I would suggest is for you to go to a ring place and get your ring finger measured and try to compare to hers. But of course the best option is to just go get her measured since this ring in particular is not resizable.
Yes
Stamped on the inner surface of the ring I ordered is pt 950 (material used) and d2. 00ct (stone quality).
yes there is when you get this ring it comes with a certificate card and number my wife loves this ring
It is a simulated diamond if you look at the description it says it a simulated diamond it is not compared to zirconia which is zirconium oxide because it contains a layer if sp3 carbon and the stone is cut exactly like the GIA standards for a flawless diamond giving it more brilliance
i need a 4 1/2 for my ring also thank u heather
Yes, you can also sync your headphones to the watch itself. Infact you can transfer music onto the watch itself, and run without your phone, it will let you listen to the music and track your steps and heart rate. However, if you are not semi-near your phone it will not receive phone calls or notifications.
The gear two has a camera built in. The gear 2 neo does not. 100 buck difference. I saved my money and love the gear 2 neo.
Yes
The watch comes with a seperate, snap on charging dock. It simply snaps onto the back of the watch. It is then charged with a standard micro USB plug, also included. Charging typically takes 1-2 hours
Yes ... i have a Samsung note 4 from t-mobile , i just downloaded "gear manager" paired it like a Bluetooth and it started automatically downloading what it needed to work . No special plans or anything
I turned it on once, and it has tracked it since beginning. Resets each day. I think it will keep tracking until you specifically turn off the function, not just the watch.
Yes, there are even you tube videos to instruct you how to properly pair them.
yes
As long as it says samsung galaxy it will work.
I'm not entirely sure but the strap you can adjust to make smaller

Yes. My daughter is 5 1/2. I got a small for her because she needs to wear it in a few weeks. The length of the dress is very long so as she grows she will not have trouble wearing it because of the length. However, it is fitted at the waist so I don't expect she will be able to wear it after 3 months. So my advice is: if you have any sewing skills so that you are comfortable stitching the waste and then opening it up as your daughter grows, go for a larger size. I can't sew worth anything so this will serve our purpose. But I have to say it is a beautiful dress.
I actually bought it from this vender, not sure why it took me here when I wanted to write a review. http://www.amazon.com/Lily-Bell-Childrens-Cosplay-Costume/dp/B00JEQV0S2/ref=lh_ni_t?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=A2JSG6292RYXQ9 Try that link. My daughter is a size 7 and I ordered the medium and it's a little big on her, so she has some room to grow in it. It's gorgeous!!

dont use btnotifier app. download "mediatek smartdevice" from the google playstore. its alot better than the btnotifier app and you dont have to do anything special to install it.
Talking time: 180minutes, Music Play :360minutes, Standby time : about 3days.
Yes it comes in english. But this is not a u8 uwatch a uwatch is 6 $ more and better quality and graffics this is a cheap knock off
Sorry for not answering sooner. Yes, it comes with a wall charger and USB cable. But you can also use any standard micro-USB charger (such as a car charger). And since most devices now use the micro-USB format for charging, you could easily amass quite a collection of chargers - I currently have 8 or 10 of them... I've lost track. That can come in handy when you buy something that doesn't include one, or if you want to keep one packed in your travel bag to be sure you don't forget it when you're on the road.
Quite, frankly, I don't think based on my own experience, this 2014 Bluetooth Smart Watch, it would work on any Cell Phone operating system, primarily because the charging mechanism issues uncontrolled power the Watch phone input power port ... it fried the Watch and of course, was at once and forever unusable. That's it - for me it is a 'no buy' period!
I don't know right now mine has- yet to come in the mail due to the weather but as soon as I find out I will let you know
Bluetooth through phone
Piece of crap, comes with no drivers so it can not connect to pc. What you get is a stupid watch. Spend a little more and get something decent!
Yes, it comes with 1 year manufacturer warranty if the product that you received is not fake. Please let us know your Amazon order number and seller name so we can research.

No music downloads.
Its one size fits most. But I would not reccomend this device. It is slow, unhelpful and fragile. Even though its cheap for a smart watch, it is not worth the money
Yes
Yes
No this watch is horrible dong buy it. It I a piece of crap.
I returned the watch. It did not work with my iPhone.
no and does not text or recive text. dont buy one
U need software on web that no longer exists. They need to send software with watch. I spent 8 hr. Messing with it before I sent it back. Good watch but needs software to complete all actions. Would not recommend w/o software.to answer question yes
It is not a GSM smart watch, it will have to be connected to a Bluetooth device to work.
Yes, you can. It has both a mic and speaker.

No, this only comes with the black leather band.
yes and I guess it depends on how sound you sleep. It wakes my husband up, no problem
This packaged version only includes the leather band, not the steel band. Amazon sells the steel band separately.
yes, is linked with your smatphone. You have to activate the automatic time zone in your phone
No you don't need to have your phone with you once your phone and Pebble Steel are synced. But if you were to get SMS or phonecalls notifications in your Pebble Steel, you'd need to have your phone with you in order to reply to those phonecalls and SMS texts. I hope this helps.. Let me know if you have additional inquiries.
I've showered with the leather band, but I wouldn't recommend doing so repeatedly. I later got the Truffol band. It's great. http://truffol.com/originals/smartwatch/strap_pebble_steel/silver
Nothing. If you buy the Pebble Steel from the Pebble website,the Steel watches are $249 and also come with a leather wristband. If you want to change it.
About two hours from the computer.
No, but I am left handed, wear it on my right wrist and have no trouble manipulating buttons.
No, the Pebble doesn't have any build in functionality to be able to compose a text or email message.
