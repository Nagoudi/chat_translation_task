You should look here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=282196403 After the game was rereleased on Steam, a Windows 8 user wrote a Steam guide on how to fix it to work on Windows 8. Note that this is done for the Steam edition. It's almost the same as the disc version, but instead of being under Steam&gt;Steamapps&gt;common it would be under its own little folder in Program Files, or under a Microprose folder.

8.1? I do not know. It *just about* works on Vista - meaning that some of the tables appear stretched. It came out before wide screen monitors, so it's video driver might have issues with proper scaling/aspect ratio. Plays fine on Vista though.
There are 7 tables.
Yes, this is an awsome game if you like pinball.
I will work, there were others that have asked this question, in almost the same fashion as you have asked. I run this on Vista 64 and it does fine. You don't loose anything, and I think I've read it also works on Win8 too. You can still use the keyboard commands for it, though its biggest issue is some of the games have sticky key issues, making it difficult to play them, and that is a quirk of the game that was never corrected as far as I know.
A boxing-themed pinball machine, Spirit of (19)'76' Haunted House, etc. Gottleib manufacturers.
Yes but I wouldn't buy it if I were you. Check out The Pinball Arcade now available on all platforms, It's amazing!! There are about 50 different classic tables and they play great. Check out www.pinballarcade.com. You'll love it.
If you looked at previous questions and the answers that were given, it appears to work on Vista, 7, 8, and 8.1. I have it on CD, and know it works on Vista just fine on my older non widescreen monitor, however it's still notorious for the dreaded stuck key situation on some games, meaning the key commands for the flippers sometimes stick.
Yes.
I really don't know, I do know it works on Vista, though I currently not gotten it reinstalled when I had to reinstall Vista over a year ago. I would imagine it might install on Win7 and work fine, unless there is a significant difference internally between Vista and Win7. I should note that I often played it on a standard aspect ratio monitor instead of my widescreen monitor (in dual screen mode) and it did fine. After all, it IS a Microsoft product so getting it to work on later OS may be easier than some others if you have issues initially as there is a make compatible mode for such older programs in newer OS'.

It seems so: http://www.eightforums.com/gaming/4295-starcraft-1-windows-8-beautiful.html
No, I didn't know it until I got it. I have to symulate one of te OS which the game is compatible with.
Don't know, I use it on Windows 7. There is a problem with it saving games, other than that is just like when it came out.
Yes it does. Thanks for your interest.
No starcraft has a decent single player campaign as well as the ability to play scenarios and general free for all against bots or people or a mix. If you get the game do a search for custom maps and scenarios. The map editor is extremely versatile and people have made dozens of custom scenarios and setting. I've even found mini rpgs
I have never had a problem saving

I play mine on windows 8.1 right click your desktop icon and go into properties and than comparability, go down the windows list and find which one looks best on your computer. Might also be an in game graphics setting and might be on Low, check that first.

Yes, but don't buy it because Homeworld 1 and 2 coming out later this year remastered, and they will work on any modern PC.
I've had no problems with it working on my Dell lap top using windows 7.
yes with some adjustments but you can get it to work.
Probably, but I'm not sure.

make sure you read each sellers description, not the header. each seller sells there item a little different. how ever if the seller states its in the original box they should provide you with pictures. if they cant don't buy it
You have to read the sellers description, if they mention that they're included, you're good to go. Also ask for exact pictures of the actual item.
I say yes just because its always fun to have the old system...and sometimes the new system and games cant compare to the feel and control of old systems&#128516;
Mine did, but it will depend on the seller you buy it from. Usually they'll have a description somewhere on the page that says what it comes with.
no, system only, no game, no cords, no controllers
I received one controller as written in the description from whom I bought it from.
Yes
Alcohol pads work well. They also work well for cleaning the electrical connections.
Wow it's been years since i played ocarina but last time i remember, i dont think so but like i said its been years so you can probably ask another
I don't think it is
Yes this product is compatible with Windows 2000
It should if xbox has usb port, but we are not sure.
No!
i need to know the same question myself just orederd one on amazon , please help ? any tips or info.
I've been playing this game for over fifteen years and I have never come across a single prostitute. It could be a typo, you can prospect for gold if you take the 'Sacramento Trail'. Maybe he meant 'prospectors'. I think it's a good idea that you are buying this game for your grandchildren. Just be sure that they have a computer that can run it. I played it on "Windows 95" in my youth but it works with my "Windows XP" laptop. Any newer Windows OS probably won't run it. You could try stuff like 'Doss Box' but that is a route that you probably don't want to take because of all the complex computer work. You could take the computer to a microsoft store but that could end up costing hundreds of dollars and even then, it's not guaranteed to work. But if you do have the proper computer hardware, "Oregon Trail 2" is the best version of the "Oregon Trail" series.
It should. If you have a 32 bit version of windows Xp should work out of the box. If you have the 64 bit version you will need to manually install it but it will work fine too.
There is just one disc, so no need to change anything during the game. It worked fine with my Windows 7 laptop. I just got a new Windows 8 laptop -- haven't tried it on that yet.
You can't. This program is for much older computer and won't install on newer models. I had the same issue.
No it won't, not out of the box. There is a work around that you can look up online though, after that it runs fine. I've done the modification myself and it works with my windows 8.1 64bit laptop.
I think if you click a button it will read to you but I'm not 100% sure
I never got it to work on Windows 7 ...it will only work on XP
No it's for windows. An older version like 95. I can't even play it.
Normally no, but there is a work around that I found just by Googling for solutions. I can now play it on Windows 8, but I have to go into the file folder and click on a particular icon. It will then play in a smaller window. It does not fill up the entire screen. Otherwise it works.
Windows 8 I'm not sure I have 7 & it wouldn't work i luckily have a laptop that has XP on it so that's how I found out it worked on XP
No. And the console didn't work. I used the cords that came to hook up to a previous console I already had.
Yes
You should be able to plug it in the same and then go to channel 3
You have to do some shopping, go to Gamestop and I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for.
It costs $50.00 and up, depending on the condition.
$50.00 and up.
You need to ask the seller which items are included, ask for pictures.
Hi Mr Reis. It does not come with 2 controllers unless it specifies. Your in luck though. I can sell you a setup like that for a very affordable price. Would you like me to help you out with that, sir? Thanks!
It all depends on who you're buying it from. Read the seller's description to find out what items are included.
Only if the seller you select advertises it as 'includes original box'. Most are fairly specific saying 'console only 'or 'console and power, no video cable', etc. If you want the box, check the 'collectible' section of resellers.
No.this is for the pc only
I do not know. My 8 year old nephew would use the wheel to play my husband's Formula 1 racing game. But we didn't have any children's games to try it with.
yes
No
Go to Logitech website to download
Yes it will. To use it on anything you will need to get the Logitech Profiler. But as long as you install the profiler it will automatically download drivers when you plug it in.
No, but it does have programmable buttons.
Yes
It works fine with Euro Truck Simulator 2, made by the same company around the same time, so I would assume it does. Yes.
The simulator includes a good variety of WWII fighter planes including the P-51D Mustang, P-47D Thunderbolt, P-38J Lightning, Supermarine Spitfire Mk.IX, Bf1096G-6, Fw190A-8, and Me262A1. Missions: There are 35 single missions, a full campaign (which may be played as the Axis or Allies), and the mission editor to create your own mission.
after meny tries i could not get any of my old or new fighter programs to work on 7 -64 bit.
Mine worked on my xp system but couldn't get it to load right on 7 - 64 bit
Yes it does, works on mine. Have fun !!
It is old enough to run on XP, been out for a while.
Yes. I've run it on XP & Windows 7.
I don't think so.
Yes. I'm running it on my laptop that has windows 7.
Sorry I never saw the plane except in movies. I also. never flew a taildrager. .Bob
I tried--it didn't work.

Yes, you will need to go to their website to download version 4.55 or above of the CH Control Manager program, then you'll be all set. Find it here: http://www.chproducts.com/13-29170-Downloads-and-Community.php
I googled the question and found many forums of users using both the CH yoke and pedals for racing games. So yes they can be use for racing. - Dave
4 inches. They are also at an awkward angle which is quite tasking during extended sessions.
I don't think so. My son and husband use this for flight simulator and they seem pleased with it.
Yep. They're a bit small and certainly take some getting used to but they're accurate and work very well once you get them setup properly within the game. I use them for roll and use the xml route to set bindings which is a bit more complex than the in-game interface but it's more fully featured. 1 to 10, I'd give them a 6 or 7. There is much much better, but not for around a hundred bucks. Saitek's pedals are good too but they don't integrate with CH software which is one huge bonus for the whole CH line of gear. Good luck and see you in the verse.
Mine do in Windows 8.1 x64. Also, plug and play, no CD needed.
No. The cable is hard-wired into the pedal base. The wires are very delicate, and would be difficult to reattach. It'd void the warranty. They are great pedals. I'd just coil up the excess cable and secure it with tape or a zip tie.
i actually do use these for Elite Dangerous and i have them set as yaw.. they work perfectly and needed no additional help or deadzone. they are spot on right out of the box.
I suppose that if you buy it, you know what's it's for, that is to use with a plane simulator (the Joystick is used for pitch and roll control, and pedals for rudder/yaw control); Depending of what sort of sim. software you use, settings for this devise is generaly in the same control panel than the joystick one. On Windows you'll perhaps need to installe the drivers for it (for Mac nothing to do, as usual, it runs)
Yes, no problem
You might try using a piece of 1" X 2" strip of wood about 11" long as a shim between claps and the bottom of the table and/or desk. It worked great for me.
I would not reccomend this for driver Sims limited turning radius.about 45 degrees each way.
My 14 year old son has this exact model of Yoke and he has had it for 4 years. He believes that it is compatible with xplane and looked it up and could find nothing that said it was NOT compatible. Additionally my experience with AMAZON is that if you buy something believing it will work with something else and it does not, they will take it back and refund the full price as long as it is returned to them quickly, is not damaged and has all of the items that came with the product like manuals etc. Good Luck
I can't remember but then again, who cares! You can and should customize them yourself and it is very easily done! One thing for sure, calibrate your yoke as otherwise it will not work properly! It's also very easily to do, takes 1 min at most!
Yes....plug and play.
Yes
Not sure as it was designed for flight simulator. I would not buy it for car sim though.
It extends out the back. It's not much though.
It uses USB power only
I have on way to test im on win7 for my games and sims
The gameboy is pretty good and mine still works just fine after all this time.
It runs on AA batteries. The SP model has a rechargeable battery and should come with a charger, but this one uses regular batteries.
You cannot charge the Game Boy Advance. You just put in new batteries. There is the Game Boy Advance SP which is rechargeable (and has a light).
Only separately
The screen is not overly bright. It is good for playing games. I do not remember if there was a brightness control. I hope this description is good enough without resorting to a scale.
no this does not come with a charger.
My GBA doesn't have a backlit screen. All the colors of the GBA don't have a backlit screen.
I doubt it. They have even started to stop making stuff for the original Nintendo DS. For old consoles like this, it much more likely that you will find it easier online than from the company.
No, the device is to allow you to play in the dark. The older game boy consoles are not "back-lit" this means that if there is no light around you won't be able to see the game. Like the screen on a TI-83 or most other older calculators.
Yes. To increase battery life, turn off color and volium
The GBA SP is designed more like the old Game Boy Color, but it folds in the middle, making it more compact.
No, the official Nintendo wave bird receiver is necessary. Other 3rd party receivers won't operate on the same fequencies
Make sure to go through the list of sellers. Not every seller includes the receiver. The one I bought did not include one, though I already had one from my now busted Wavebird.
It works with a Wii just fine. It won't work with a Wii-U because there aren't any controller ports, but it works with a Wii.
Mine came with a receiver, I just wish the controller worked a bit more.
it works on the wii so i am assuming yes it will work for mario kart
Yes the save works. They actually replaced the save battery with a brand new one so the save will work for many more years.
Either your GBA is malfunctioning, or the game is. Try another game to test your GBA. Also, try cleaning the pins on the game with a Qtip and rubbing alcohol. - DAMP NOT WET. MAKE SURE TO LET THE GAME DRY COMPLETELY BEFORE USING IT. The game will not save your progress if it needs a new battery. If it keeps crashing, then it is definitely defective.
No it does not come with the box or anything. Mine came in a game boy color cartridge case with a new battery. If you want one still in a box, it will cost a lot of money because most kids opened the box and then threw it away.
yes you can, I play it on mine all the time.
Been using it with Windows 7 64 bit for years, works perfectly under that OS with native support.
Not sure. I play BF4 on Win7 Pro without any issues, however.
Mine did yes
Yes. When I had that joystick, I was using a machine running XP
It does work with Windows 8 with default Drivers, I don't think Microsoft had made new drivers available for MAC. You might have to use built in default Drivers to make it work. Also without Microsoft Driver suppose you will not have FORCEFEEDBACK feature turned on.
No you cannot. Not on the stick itself. But most who buy the twist handle "rudder" type sticks need/love that feature. You could buy a generic stick without twist handle to fit your specific needs.
Yes
Hi Dennis The one I purchased has a silver grey trigger button. And it is flawless, works great.
Yes I am still using mine without any issues
As long as it has a USB port it should work fine. Windows xp and windows 7 work fine, I'm sure windows 8 should work as well.
Windows 7 does NOT like the device driver for that game. CFS 2 and 3 work under Win 7 and the joystick works FINE for them and all other games I have - including the Battlefield series including 3 and 4, but the first CFS game does NOT work with that joystick. I have searched for a solution but they are complicated and do not seem to work.
yes mine is. but be careful some are not. the old models are not usb
The microsoft Sidewinder Precision 2 joystick works great, and has all the functionality it needs. What I really love about that joystick is it lasts forever. I've been through many joysticks and I've had really bad luck with newer, digital joysticks. If you take apart the sidewinder you will see it's an analog joystick and personally it seems to last much longer even treating it harshly.
Yes and no. After I wrote my initial review on the Sidewinder, it worked great for about a week. Afterwards, it was hit or miss as to when it would work. I finally gave up and got this instead: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CXYMFS/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1 No problems since!
i am not sure i do beleave it did NOT come with software but i will look for some
It may not work with an Apple product...the joystick is a Microsoft product...they (Microsoft & Apple) don't play together!
YES! It MUST come with controller and all cables. According to the UPC, that is what the system came with so according to Amazon's policy, it MUST come with all those cables and controller. All the people selling them without them are violating Amazon's policy.
Yes, it comes with all necessary wires and a controller.
This isn't a question
No it does not
It will say in the description of the item what it all includes.
The Gamecube only supports AV cables. So if your TV has AV ports, which it most likely does, then it should work but there is not a way to play games in HD.
Yes
Yes
No it doesn't . The only thing it comes with its Is the console itself everything else is sold separately.
Yep sorry I thought I mentioned that in the review. Cheers
I play my roller coaster tycoon 2 on windows 8. Runs perfectly fine and isn't buggy. Just like when I was running it on windows 7!!
Yes it is
Yes
Well, I don't have a Mac book I have a Sony Vaio Laptop, sorry. I think you need to buy something like a small box that connects to your laptop so you can put in CDs. All in all, fun game.
Windows 98/2000/Me/XP will all work with a windows 7 computer
No. When I looked into upgrading to windows 8 that was one of the programs it listed as being non-compatible
It should, I use it on an old laptop that hasn't been updated in years, and it works great.

I have X-Plane 10, but find that the CH Flightstick Pro (USB) is somewhat unstable on this program. By working with it more I hope to improve it, maybe. I have an HP Pavilion i5 with 8 megs of RAM but maybe not the graphics that I need with some of the newer sims. I have an old PII with man sims running on it with a total CH set up, Flightstick Pro, Throttle Pro and CH Rudders with par. ports. With some real aircraft experience, I'll have to say that the old sims were the most realistic, even though they lacked in graphics. Also, you may have a later version than XPlane 10. I have read that '10' did have some control problems. Otherwise, the Flightstick Pro seems to work well with MS Flightsim X and some others I have. CH is a very good company. I've even toured their plant some years ago.
No force feedback. No Z axis for rudder control either.
Used mine for years.. Still going and working fine!,, even has lived through the Grand Kids !!!!
Yes, no rudder controls though.
According to the info on "Ch Hanger.com," the Control Manager is supported in Windows 8.1. You might want to check this out also. Hope this helps. Ron K
According to 'mypilotstore.com' the CH Flightstick Pro is compatible with Windows 8, but was not inclusive to 8.1. It probably is. Thanks, Ron K
Not for usb. Bluetooth support for external controllers are only available on a jailbroken device. Haven`t seen anything for USB.
I have not encountered this problem before, but, if you enter the joystick calibration program from inside the Gold X program, you should be able to determine if the stick is operating properly by watching the response on the calibration screen. I do recall that years ago I had some issues with Microsoft CFS2 with loss of control of aircraft in the program, but, that was due to program errors and settings. If Gold X has difficulty settings, you might check those and see if they are set properly. Good luck.
No adjustable springs. it is x-y centered and comes with good software. I use it because it is one of the few sticks made that left handed players can use.
Hi. I believe that the combatstick could be used as it only requires a usb port and the companies software however I would e-mail CH products and inquire just to be on the save side. Also, this product has no twist grip feature so that would also be a consideration.
Yes. I used it like that until I bought a separate throttle. You'll want to be sure and make sure the throttle wheel is calibrated each time you fire up the machine because mine jumps around a bit, or build dead zone in the axis extremes to reduce throttle sensitivities in those areas.
No
No, all CH products use classic pots. However, they are "high quality," at least that's what people say. I've never heard of anyone's pots wearing out on CH gear, unlike other manufacturers.
Ch should work with all library drivers-if not call CH in calif and get them
I would guess that it does, but I don't know personally. It works with IL-2 Sturmovik: 1946, which is why I bought it originally. Great stick.
There's some conflicts in these answers, so let me straighten things up. The Fighter replaces two push buttons with one 4-way hat and one 2-way hat. Other than that the Combat and Fighter stick are identical. They both have a throttle wheel left of the stick, and built in trim wheels for the x and y axes. Trim is a bit troubling on most sticks since you don't get the feedback on the controls as less stick pressure is required. Don't think that this makes this stick bad since any sim that has trim has this drawback unless you have a force-feedback stick that simulates this (those are almost impossible to find.) The extra hats are great for modern jet study sims, but if you are into games like IL-2, there are normally enough buttons. On the otherhand you can map a ton of functions to all the extra contols, and adding a throttle that has a lot of buttons means you may not even touch your keyboard ingame. The Fighterstick tends to be at least 20 bucks more, so if you want the extra functionality, that's the price.
Hi I just checked my mail : CH Products In my experience thus far has out of the Box worked w/every OS I have had most recent PC-Win Ultimate 7. This said, It should work fine. We all know that there are exceptions to every rule. This is "Y" They created Technical Support. 'Nuff said here. Best Flying. Scott ~
I am not sure that it can work with the CH Combatstick. CH has their own software for programming the devices. My advice is to go here and ask your questions. http://www.ch-hangar.com/forum/index.php Good luck to you.
I found the review comparing the two at FiringSquad's site quite helpful. http://www.firingsquad.com/hardware/ch_products_saitek_x52_review In the end the reviewer discovered that it largely depends on the games you play and your personal style.
The default model is right hand only, but I have seen a left hand version. I am not sure where it came from.
Yes
Here are some instructions on downloading and troubleshooting: ftp://ftp.chproducts.com/pub/pdf/Fighterstick%20USB.pdf The Control Manager download that lets you customize and set up your Flightstick is here: http://www.chproducts.com/Flightstick-Pro-v13-d-723.html Don't think there was a written manual?
Yes, you can feel it centering. You can feel the springs stop fighting you.
Do not have any problems, but I don't use that often.
My experience is that the connection technology doesn't last 10 years. I replaced mine when I couldn't find a good adaptor to switch from the old pins to USB. The old one probably still works fine if my newer computer had a port for it.
No twist axis. It's a great joystick, rugged and reliable but a twist axis would be nice. Software is easy to use.
I am not there but I will throw in a few things on this. This stick has very very short throw buttons on it. Even the main trigger move very little when pressed. They all have very little throw to them but It makes it easy to trigger actions. They are mechinical switches so there wouldn't be a way to freeze/lock all of them that I can think of. Hope this helps.
Yes it can. I really can't recommend the CH Products enough. I own the Fighterstick, Pro Throttle, and Pro Pedals. I know several people using this setup on Windows 8. Just head over to the CH Hanger for any assistance.
I just got a new laptop with windows 8.1 and it works fine thus far. It should work okay.
my old PC and my now newly-built one both have Windows-7 installed, and "Doom 3" runs perfectly fine. Oh, and I'd stick with the 2004-05 versions of this and "Resurrection of Evil", and not get the BFG Edition (as they nerfed the hell out of that one)
Try to run it on medium install. It could be that your MAC can't support the game on full install
Collectors value. The thing is the BFG edition is the better of the two. With the BFG Edition You not only get Doom 3, but you get the original Doom, Doom 2, Doom 3, Doom 3 Resurrection of evil add on pack, plus 8 new levels known as, "The lost mission" that was never before seen from the rest of the Doom world. While with Doom 3, you just get, well... Doom 3. However I suppose the price for Doom 3 would be greater as it does have a bit of collectors value at this point, especially with the new Doom game about to drop between 2015 and 2016. But I digress, if you're gonna try to get into Doom, I suggest the BFG edition all the way around. I have both copies and BFG is a well worth it buy.
it works on windows 7 so I think it should work on windows 8
I don't remember. I gave the game away after playing it. The game kind of sucked. Sorry
Yes it does. It has a main screw-down from underneath, and 2 side clamps that are operated from on top.
I use one of these on a pc with Windows 7,64 bit. It is compatible. EA Need for speed shift2 unleashed works well if your video card is up to it !
It will be a power adapter, not a charger. You just need to find a power adapter that matches the voltage on the wheel and the same pin size. Second hand stores are always a good option for finding those.
Push forward for up, back for down (and it has paddles behind the wheel too) SO 'Semi Automatic' ...ie there is no clutch....and its just back and forward...it doesnt have 'gates' like a manual stick in a real car...
You will more than likely find one online. I didn't receive a manual when I purchased mine. It was refurbished, though, so that might explain why.
unfortunately, no :(
It worked fine for me for a couple of years but I had an old one like yours and eventually had to upgrade to a G27 because the MOMO started to steer to the left instead of centering automatically. As long as your drivers are up to date and your steering is true your MOMO will work with Windows 7... and with Windows 7 you will be able to upgrade to Windows 10 for free when it becomes available.
The red version does for me...same drivers, so I dont see why not.
Yes
Yes
Not a bagpipe, though mostly hot air.
No I don't know don't get this you have to have like 1984 software make a better choice than I did

Yes you should download glovepie 0.45 and take a look at it.
No, I had to purchase one separately, but you can find one for only 4$
Probably, talk to the sellers. Or maybe it's your games?
Amazon requires all sellers to offer at least a 30 day return policy on the items they sell. Certain sellers offer a better warranty on items, as do we. Specifically check out each seller, the better their feedback the more likely they sel quality products with quality service!
Yes a little bit. But also is in color and lights up so it can be used in the dark.
yes, the one i had was the newer version with the brighter screen display
Everything was included an in excellent condition
it depends.
Yes
yes.
No
Yes. No Problem
Yes
The game does not update if you don't have an Internet connection, if you have Internet connection, the game updates itself.
no. The servers no longer support halo 2.
No
It is made for the original Xbox, and Xbox One is not backwards compatible. Not sure which system your "1" is referring to.
No, but they will on the new Xbox, the Xbox One. Halo: The Master Chief Collection has Halo 1 Anniversary, Halo 2 Anniversary, Halo 3, and Halo 4 for $60. It also includes early access to Halo 5's multiplayer.
Hi: Yes it did most people told us that it wouldn't but my son had no issues playing it.
Yes, as long as you have an xbox 360 with an official Microsoft Hard Disk Drive. If you buy a generic HDD for a 4GB Xbox 360 console, it does not include what's required to emulate original Xbox games. There are methods described online for adding the ability to emulate original Xbox game to generic HDD. I followed one of these tutorials since the generic HDD are about half the price of Microsoft's HDD.
Yes
Initially, I did install the program on a laptop that was running Windows 8. It seemed to work fine on it. I haven't tried it on windows 8.1, but as 8.1 is a vast improvement over Windows 8, I would think it would run on it, but I can't say for sure. The only things that really seemed to change from Windows 8 and 8.1 is just that 8.1 looks like the traditional Windows desktop, and they made the side bar less sensitive. They also seemed to fix a lockup on start issue that was created with the first 8.1 Update.
Yes, Raymond, This version of Microsoft Flight Simulator does have 4 CD's CD's 1, 2, and 3 load the program into your computer. CD 4 must remain in your CD Drive to activate and run the program. Happy Flights!! DWL
No, but you do need disk 4 in the cd/dvd drive.
Absolutely.
Garmin 500. Easy to work with.
Yes
No you sould be able to just look on line for updates and add on
I believe the question was "can you download the FSX program onto a external disk drive and the answer is yes, however the program will run fine on the C: drive of your computer since that will probably be the only drive being used at the time. If you want to add scenery or aircraft too the Flight Simulator Program, that will go directly into the FSX program.
Probably, it runs on XP. It needs speed for all the graphics. Processor and video card. Runs fine on my hopped up old XP machine. The new edition basically needs a high end gaming machine. Cool but not needed. MS generally runs somewhat old programs well, sometimes better. I am not an IT person.
I use a LOGITECH EXTREME PRO. It is a joystick that is around $30. Google it to see what it looks like. There are much better and more expensive yokes and joysticks out there, but if you are just starting out, this is a good one to use.

Yes ... I've been playing it in Windows 8 & 8.1 from a long time now ...
It does have a CD key, but the code can be reused. I have used mine to download it onto many different computers.
It's a RTS. Not similar to WoW. The online gameplay on WC3 is dead . So it's only worth buying it for the campaign. I've played WoW for 8 years and plenty of time on WC3
No the game can be played right away through a link from Battlenet with the activation codes on the disks. I like the direct kind of access and would suggest if you are a true gamer you want to download the content on the disks to start the game directly from your pc without having to indirectly access it through the online link.
No
World of war craft the last I check it was 15
I am not certain, but my guess would be that you can play it online multiplayer. As for cross-platform as in computer-to-computer, I don't know.
No sadly. I just got on the other night .
Yes and yes
Check out Blizzard's response to this question: https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/playing-older-blizzard-titles-on-mac-os-x-10-7-lion . It depends on your version of Mac OS. (PS: I typically play games on my PC, not on my Mac, because of issues like this).

yes, warthunder even has a preset for this the stick.
Yes indeed... it is the default joystick in Star Citizen's Arena Commander and works well. This is the main reason I purchased this stick.
In my opinion, the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro joystick is best. Three reasons: It is very responsive based on your requirements. It is very easy to use and all the controls are where you would expect them to be. And, since I use the flight simulation as a part of my relaxing routine, it is nice to have a piece of equipment that I trust and enjoy.
The joystick's handle itself twists approximately 15 degrees to either side for yaw, angles appx. 40 degrees (side to side) for roll, -pitches (forward/down) at appx 45 degrees and +pitches (backwards/up) at 30-35 degrees. What those motions will correspond to will really depend on the application in which they are used. Most flight games have advanced control settings that will let you tailor the response of the aircraft to the range of motion of the stick in advanced or personalized control set up menus.
Approximately 4 feet.
What other games is it compatible with? Is there a list somewhere? Are there any games included with the set-up software? Hank
Yes it is an outstanding stick for Elite Dangerous, that's the reason I bought it, and couldn't be happier.
It does. There are better HoTaS options with more buttons on both hands, but this is a great stick for the price.
Yes it will work on Battlefield 4
Yes, it works, but it's really small and inputs are approximate.
Not anymore. Update 1.08 removed the CD check, and Update 1.10 was just released to allow Multiplayer after GameSpy shuts down :)
This and halo custom edition both work for win 7
Have used on Windows 7, 8, and 8.1
Well a computer that can handle it, which isn't hard since it's an old game. If you want, then an Xbox controller but that's optional. Really just the keyboard and mouse. I hope I answered correctly.

you can use a game controller.That how I play the game.You will also like the game.
If you're using a mac, download bootcamp it should work, as for how well it works, i do not know how to translate mac specs into pc counterparts, it is controller compatible i have used xbox 360 wired and ps3 controllers, if for some reason it does not recognize your controller try http://pinnaclegameprofiler.com/ beware after the free trial it costs money.
Just a CD key as far as I know.
hi ! well i dont play MP anymore, but this article from PC GAMES say : While EA are flailing about, trying to find a solution to their GameSpy service shutdown woes, Bungie have been secretly working with top men to ensure that their game lives on. Halo: Combat Evolved will receive a patch that will ensure the game's multiplayer lobby will work "just as it always has". The patch was announced on the Halo-Fixes forum "A small group has been quietly preparing for the shutdown of the GameSpy Master Server (which provides the list of Halo servers) and they are finally ready to discuss their work. The group consists of Roger Wolfson aka Sawnose (of Bungie), Btcc22 (of HAC2), Kornman00 (of OpenSauce) and myself, Technut (of PQ Clan). "As a result of their work, especially Btcc22 and Roger, Bungie will be releasing version 1.0.10 of Halo PC and Halo CE soon, which will include the fix for the Lobby!" There's no release date for the patch, but Technut is planning to release more information within the next couple of days. PS: yep patch already out if you want ! http://halo-fixes.findforum.net/t36-bungie-officially-releases-patch-110-includes-the-lobby-fix
no....not this halo
it is the rolled up paper with the ribbon around it laying on the desk
I think it depends on which operating system you are using. We have the old versions and they still work on our recient up grade to Vista but there are some glitchs showing up that were never there when we were running Windows 98.
That's what I thought. But sadly, no.
It is a replacement break-away cable for original xbox controllers.
Unfortunately no. An original Xbox console controller is required. The cable worked great for my needs though.
Sorry. I dont know. I have the original x box
I don't know I am not the seller. I purchase this item for the original x-Box
SMB 3 is easier.
There are 8 world's with about 88 levels between them if you count fortress and castles 8 mini boss fights and 8 boss fights
They are better than the NES. Think Super NES type graphics.
I think it depends on who's selling it, but I didn't get them from the person I ordered from. I don't have an eReader anyway, so I wasn't really looking for them in the first place.

You have to either use another disk to install or choose the setup for the other two somewhere in game or at title.
Hello Ashley, Please note that we have this item in stock. You can search for AmitCJ seller under the listing of this product.
It does not have these animals
Yes my sister used it on two different computers
My Zoo Tycoon is on a CD. I put it in my computer to play the game. My PC plays all discs. I am using a windows 7.
Yes. It works
I'm not sure but if u read requirements it should tell you. I think it does though.
Sorry, I haven't tried to install it on a Windows 8 computer. I have it installed on two Windows 7 computers and it runs fine so I would think it would work on 8. As i recall it took a couple attempts to get it installed on them but I simply installed it using the disks.
Yes! It also works on Windows 8
Mailed, I don't know if there is an option for digital download but there might be.

I just finished a puzzle an hour ago and I can tell you that it works fine on Win8.0, I have not upgraded to 8.1 yet. I hope this answers your question.
Yes it will wook on windows 7
i'm using Microsoft 7, no idea about vista, might be worth a shot, but I love the puzzles.

No, it does not. Only offers WEP. I had to drop my network down to WEP to use this adapter for my xbox.
Yes it does.
uses AC outlet.
the netgear gateway cg814wg v2 is compatible with xbox-live, but you have to make sure you buy it yourself. if you let the cable company give you one, the company's firmware will be on the gateway and there is no way to tell if it will work because alot of comcast customers,"i'm one of them" keep getting kicked offline as soon as i connect to xbox live and they don't have servicemen that can fix it
Reset the router. Most routers have a button on the back that you push and hold in with a pencil tip or something for so many seconds. This will reset everything to factory defaults (including the password). Look up the specific router model on the Linksys website for setup instructions.
You've gotta use your PC, I think, attach it to your network and go directly to the device via browser..its IP should be 192.168.x.x - check the manual. Login with admin/admin or admin/blank password and put in your wifi info. You should be good to go!
While I can't give you a 100% as I don't use Win 8 (and neither does anybody i know, its REALLY unpopular here) it works great in Win 7 and if it works in 7 it nearly always works with 8.
Simple answer: Yes!
Logitech says their joystick is indeed packaged with a manual. But you can also find one here: http://www.logitech.com/en-us/support/attack-3-joystick
any one you want. xp ,7, it is a usb stick and will work on any available usb port. also comes with a install disk and instructions on how to calibrate! hope this helps
No
No, didn't need one. I just plugged it in and went right to it. My OS is Windows 7.
Not sure, sorry
I only used it on windows. Sorry
I am not sure. I use it for windows vista. I think Logitech has a website that should tell you.
yes, for sure Win 7 and should work with xp
Nope.
No
Where exactly would I be able to locate this information?? ( I checked under my amazon orders as well as on the ad. I am at work currently and am unable to open the program on my laptop at this time if that is where I would find it.)
It does work on Windows 7; however, i would highly recommend patching/modding it so that it runs smoother. Due to its age, the game suffers from frequent crashes that may hinder gameplay if you don't save frequently (every 5 minutes).
Yep, runs ok. In game you may have to go to the video settings and change rendering to "software" instead of "hardware" to make it run smooth.
I bought a new Laptop in 2012 with windows 7 and it plays this game just fine.
Yes.
If you bought a used copy, then you need to get a transfer of ownership from the original owner, and notify EA Games. Otherwise you might have a pirated copy. Also, before you do any of that, check your Cap Locks key, and retyping the key code.
No
No

be very careful of what you are looking at. the picture you see on the opening page may not be what each seller is selling. you have to read there comments. some sellers sell just the console, some sell console and cord without controllers. YOU REALLY have to reach what EACH seller is selling. hope this helps
honestly your better off just getting a refund like a did because I called customer service a bunch of times and removed my review on them because they said they would send another at no charge due to the fact the other one was a month late and was returned to them with damage. son just get your money back.
For the PlayStation, it depends on what it says on your gaming system. I would check the bottom, sides etc. Commonly, it's AC220. Some outlets only run at AC 110-120. But as far as voltage goes, I've never had an issue with not having enough. I didn't know that this was a problem. Hope this helps ! : )
Mine did. I believe it is on a per sale basis. Look in description closely. The system itself works fine. Still in use.
This model of the PS2 is very quite as for the cord: the standard cord is about 4ft long. Hope that helps
yes it is.
No just the console.
Just the controls1 and wires w.
Yes it is still for sale and works fine but remember you're only getting the consul
The one I purchased came with controllers
Game runs awesome on my Windows 8 laptop. Due to that, it should run great on Windows 7 as well. If that's not enough, I have friends using Windows 7 that play the game fine. As for Vista, can't say for sure, but probably fine, since the game still works on Windows XP and 7/8, the older and newer versions.
No the boxed copy of Morrowind has no CD key to enter to redeem.
Call amazon customer service and they should give you a full refund, as they did for me. I too, was fooled by the reseller's bait and switch tactic. When I called amazon customer service, my agent said he could see multiple similar complaints in the history. He immediately. Issued a full refund and even told me that I need not bother returning the product.
Yes, the DVD version I received required that you start the installation through Steam. I also own the much older CD version which does not require steam. The files are read from the DVD after the installation is started, but you still have to have an internet connection to do it.
I believe, once you buy the disc version, its as simple as installing it, along with steam. the pc edition I bought works just fine.
no you dont need it to play the game but you do need internet connection to download the game because it uses steam to download it
No, no instruction booklet either.
It appears that the answer is yes though I was content with the PC controls; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RzMd5RaPuI
Somewhat. If I remember the dimensions it was roughly 12" long by 6" wide by 2" high.
Nope. Just the nineteen dollar one and you activate it on Steam, then download the game to your computer. Nothing to it. You can download it over and over if you update a hard drive or get a new computer. But it is your game, you own it. You can back it up to anyplace you like on your computer to have a "local" copy of it if you like. Been using Steam since it was Valve and never had any issues. Steam keeps your games updated automatically if you desire too.
Unfortunately it doesn't, the shoulder buttons on the ps2 controller are very short.
yes it wil it has better response with a ps1 controller because the buttons aren't pressure sensitive with a ps2 controller i find you have to press a bit harded for response but if you get a ps1 controller it does work percectly it also works well with ps2 arcade sticks and wheels
No
no it wont because its for the old original xbox not the 360
sorry but this doesn't work for guitars. It is used for regular controllers and the wii wheel but if you are looking for one that works with the guitar go to this part of amazon. http://www.amazon.com/PS2-Controller-Adapter-Wii-Remote-Wii/dp/B002OJ8S7C/ref=sr_1_75?ie=UTF8&qid=1332517662&sr=8-75 **Update** i ordered the one in the link i sent you and it doesn't work for guitars either . i'm currently getting one of another kind shipped, i'll let you know if that one works and send you the link.

Yes..downloaded onto Windows 7 on all three of my computers and had no problems.
I have recently purchased Windows 7 and could not download it on windows 7. I bought Hoyle Card Games 2012 and was easily able to download that. The 2012 version is very similar to the 2005 version. It has the same characters and games. Sorry I cannot specifically answer your question about Windows 8.
Yes! It works just fine.
Yes it works great. Only problem I have is no speech on characters but everything else seems to work fine.
I bet it does, I use it on Window 8. I love the bridge game, wish Hoyle Card games would put one out for iPad.

Hi, No, you need to play it on a pc or laptop or tablet with a Windows or Macintosh operating system. Thanks for asking.
yes it will but not mac computers and I cant use the one I bought .
No, this does not work on iPad. It is a CD-ROM. You may be able to find similar/comparable apps on the App Store. Some Phonics/reading apps we like are Montessori Crosswords, Super Why and Meme tales. They are all under $5 and align with preschool/ kindergarten common core language arts standards.
I couldnt get it to run on my windows 7...kept freezing and locking up the computer. Don't know if I had a defective disc or what but I ended up sending mine back.
I can't get Reader Rabbit to run on my windows computers XP or later. I don't know what OSX is. I am disappointed because my children loved reader rabbit and my grandson did too.
No. It doesn't even work on newer Windows 7 or 8. Don't buy this crap.
No
It might
It is a CD
No... it's a great product, but it doesn't run on Windows 7 or 8. You'll need an older Windows XP to run it. I wish the publisher would revamp it for the newer OS.

Hello, sorry for delay. Perhaps you can run it without problems, but it is a old game. I couldnt used it. I recommend you to buy some more new.
Yes, it does. However, it will require you to run it in compatibility mode and make some other changes to get it to work without crashing. See: http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/165797/kotor-2-freezes-on-movies for the fix.
I'm not sure what you mean my "free roam" but you do have to be a jedi or a sith. You can also be a "gray jedi" which is basically in-between, and you'll get some different dialog and benefits/penalties for that as well.
I bought this long before the release of Windows 8.1. (This was a gift for younger brother.) I don't want to assume that it's not compatible. Do you participate on any online forums that focus on these type of games? They would be better able to answer this question for you.
I'm using it with Windows 8.
It will not work with Windows 8.
I just tried to install it, and it wouldn't install because I have a 64 BIT system.
I use it with windows #7. I don't think the one shown is the same as mine. My disc is by Random House Webster's college Dictionary. Tropics entertainment and powered by Word Genius. There are lots College Webster Dictionary software. Some of them did not work with #7. email Tech support www.topics-ent.com/support. I thought I bought the only copy available. Tom
It is a pin plug and not a USB. If needed, you can purchase an adapter to convert a USB into a pin plug.
Not that I'm aware of or see listed. This is a very basic board. I didn't even know keyboards came with volume control.
Honestly, I am not positive, but I use it on a Dell and it works fine. I use an adapter for the pin plug into a USB port. At times, I have had to unplug it and then plug it back in if it does not work. Bottom line, for me the comfort of this keyboard far outweighs the occasional inconvenience. Hope this helps.
5V==50mA
Yes. That top line is as follows. The Esc key is on the left end, by itself. Then, moving to the right you have a space the size of a key, then F1 F2 F3 F4; small space, F5 F6 F7 F8; small space, F9 F10 F11 F12; small space Print Screen, Scroll Lock, Pause.
I use mine for TIE Fighter, X-wing, and X-wing Alliance. It is designed to be used in flight simulators and space fighter type games. I hope this helps you out.
No. It is molded to fit a right hand. I never even thought how a lefty would have to use it.....
No
Yes it is, I have been using mine under windows 8.1. It works very well,
Yes, its analog as well as an analog throttle control. The hat is a 4-way digital.
Yes
I don't see why not if your computer can handle it. JJ
Yes
I think so. it uses a USB plug so if your older PC has a USB port then it will work.
If you are talking about the atari 2600 EMULATOR your best guess is to check the web site of the developer. Being and emulator fan myself I dont think so because the emulator does not work when you partially move the joystick (the stick is analog if I remember correctly). What you would need to try is for example a 4 way joystick or an 8 way joystick. I dont have time to install the emulator and test it today, sorry.
This is the UK version! They should really put that in the description.......
Along time ago it did. But those servers were long shut down. If you are looking to race online on the PC you could play need for speed world. It's free.

Why yes.

Why yes.
No. It plugs into the same port as a wired GBA link cable, so it only works with Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP and Game Boy Player. If you want to access multiplayer functions of Game Boy Advance games, you'll need those systems or a Game Boy Micro with a special adaptor.
Yes
No. You'd need a Game Boy Color link cable (or Game Boy universal link cable), which is going to be hard to find as there are so many knock-offs. A genuine Nintendo cable will say 'Nintendo' near at least one of the ends. If you can't find one, trading Pokmon is possible using multiple N64 Transfer Paks and Pokmon Stadium 2, but for other games, you may be out of luck.
This GBA wireless adapter is for the Gameboy Advance and Gameboy Advance systems (not compatible with the GBA Micro), and replaces the GBA link cable for games that support it, most commonly Pokemon Emerald, Pokemon Fire Red, and Pokemon Leaf Green.
Each additional system needs its own wireless adapter to connect, yes. However, this is a wireless adapter for Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP and Game Boy Player only; other Game Boy systems and Game Boy (Color) games are not compatible.
No. The DS lite uses different wireless frequencies and cannot play GBA games in multiplayer mode, period. You need to use multiple GBA systems.
Interchangeable - yes. You get two different keysets - one regular, one gaming (WASD keys on the left and others). The keysets have a clip on the side that you flip up to change out and flip down to lock in place. You don't flip anything upside down. Hope this answers your question.
Works great in Windows 7 HOWEVER I never found win7 drivers for the presets. I use it in games daily and I don't miss the presets.
I don't think that this keyboard will work with a mac.You should also really check steel series website on legacy products for that info an any other info for this keyboard.
Yes, yes it is.
I doubt it. it comes with software
No, the keyboard only "plugs-in" one way; with the butterfly on the left side.
This keyboard is not wireless. I don't use wireless keyboards or mice for gaming so I can't respond to the second question.
It does have both AoM & AoM: Titans. The interesting part is the Code/Key is the same for everyone of these you purchase and it will not play with other original versions of AoM or AoM: Titans in a LAN game. On the plus side you can uninstall the versions on the other LAN computers you have and install this version and then it will play LAN game mode. Interestingly, once installed it does NOT require the DVD either. I purchased three copies of this to game with two of my original versions for LAN gaming. I was a bit upset to find out they all have the same Code/Key and really annoyed to find they wouldn't play with my originals. Then I decided to try uninstalling my originals and installing this version and my LAN games were running fine (5 player fun). When it comes to Windows 8.1 I'm not sure as I've only run this on Windows XP SP3 + Windows 7 Home Edition. Hope this helps! When it comes to
Yes, it runs on my Windows 8.1 system.
yes it can but there may be some compatability issues if so try this it worked for me. Follow the steps to install in Compatibility mode: a. Right click the set up file and select Properties then tap or click the Compatibility tab. b. Place a check in the Run this program in compatibility mode box. c. Tap or click the drop down box and select a previous Operating System, then tap or click OK.
If you are talking about the LAN between people on the same network, you do require two copies of the same game so you can both play, one for each computer because the serial key is unique to each installation, and also because you both require a CD on each of the computers for the program to run.
its been so long since i ordered it. i had a hard time also finding the product key. it is either in the case or on the case. im pretty sure it doesnt say" product key" its just a bunch of numbers and maybe letters. is there anyway you can bypass it? are you trying to play online? if so you will most likely need it. if your just playing off line, im pretty sure you can bypass it. if you cant find it, let me know and i will look for my game. its been years since ive played.
You should be able to find a serial key online. If you want to play online you have to buy the steam version (enhanced version).
you can install and run it on windows 8 and 8.1 using compatibility mode. so do not know about windows 7 but if it works on windows 8 then 7 should in same mode.

When I saw the extended edition on steam, I bought it. But i also bought the goals edition from amazon. Problem: They messed up badly with the multiplayer network (Doesn't matter how fast your connection is and how beasty your computer is). Even if played via lan, the lag totally kills the fun, and at least for myself and everyone I know, makes the multiplayer beyond frustrating. -If you intend to play the campaign and single player ai skirmishes only, go ahead and enjoy. HOWEVER, -If you want to buy this for the MULTIPLAYER, - DON'T BUY THIS! (unless you can put up with massive lag) do not know about transfer to steam as i bought mine from steam. i hope this helps you this is all i know. oh number of multi-players is pending on the server you connect with at the time.
Go to voobly.com, make an account, download the client, and then you can go on the AoM: Titans lobby and play online through that client.
It's in English. You can choose UK for English. If your system has different language for program Please change it from control panel Thank you
Put the game in your CD tray. It may need to download something to your computer
Hello Jaime, The answer to your question is yes you can. In fact I use this as well on my Windows 8 Computer as well. I dont think that Logitech still has the drivers on there servers to download any longer (but again I am not shore they may) but I would plug it into my USB and my computer installs/downloads the drivers when it is connected. The other method that I have used was I would run windows updates and it will find the newer drivers for it. I hope this helped you out.
Yes
I've had no trouble using it in racing games. The joysticks are good for just about any game really. The holes are square so you might need to learn to control your thumbs a bit more but it's honestly nothing that will bug you for very long if at all.
Absolutely
The controller states that it works for Windows Vista.However it seems to be the most Compatible with outdated OS's Windows 98,2000,ME & XP! not 7 or 8.
Yes
Don't see why it wouldn't. I have one, and use it with Project 64, ZSnes, ROCKnes, Kega Fusion, Chanka, and others all the time with no problems. It's d-pad is ok for a standard cross type. But I have an older Thrustmaster Firestorm Dual Power 3, and I think it's dpad is more comfortable. Lots of luck finding one though--like I said, they're older gamepads, and getting hard to find now.
I have windows 7 64bit, running Intel i7 extreme processor. i really wonder if there is any controller tested that can work on windows 64bit!!!! appriecate your output
Only used it a couple times. It's not compatible with all my games. And that was over 4 years ago
You need the software disc for apple lioaded on your computer:)
Here is a list of Mac compatible Logitech Gamepads: Cordless Rumblepad (G-RA4A) Cordless Rumblepad 2(G-RC14) Dual Action (G-UF13A, G-UD8) Precision USB (G-UG15) Wingman Precision (USB) (G-UC3B) check this link http://forums.logitech.com/t5/Logitech-G-Controllers/Gamepad-f310-Mac-Compatibility-how-to-install-on-a-Mac/td-p/529274/page/2
Doom might not be compatible with it. Are you on a Mac or PC?
This controller does work on Mac through USB. I have a 2006 MacBook and this controller works great. The wireless receiver plugs into your USB port. The Mac recognized the controller automatically and that was that!
I plugged it into a Visual Land Connect and the D-Pad and left stick work, but all of the buttons appear to be Enter or Backspace by default. Haven't figured out how to change that yet.
it worked for me with most emulators i played on mac. specifically there was a super nintendo one... forgot the name of it, but it worked splendidly on that. never got it to work with any playstation emus. also look into gamepad companion
It works with my macbook, and I did not have to install a driver, I don't know for sure about a MB air, but I imagine it woudl be the same
I would assume so.
yes i played left for dead with it on win7 and XP ..
Yes it does.
I think the cord is approximately 78 inches long.
http://forums.gamernode.com/showthread.php?t=21133 They mention several options there, including the XBox 360 controller.
Its a pretty good stick if that's what your asking...as for closeness to a helicopter stick I'm not sure of but as far as simulations go this is a upper mid range stick I think its worth the money. I use it for dcs a-10 simulator and its excellent and that's a very detail oriented simulator
The joystick connects to the throttle module with a mini-DIN connector, and the throttle module in turn connects to your computer via USB. The joystick cannot be used separately from the throttle module.
Go here: http://www.saitek.com/uk/prod/x52.html and go to the download tab at the top and download the correct drivers and software for your X52 Flight Control System. Make sure it is NOT the PRO version, unless you own a pro version. Your mouse throttle could be broken or a bad USB cable. I use mine for Microsoft FSX games. If you are using it for something else other than FSX, then that is out of my department.
Yes a roller is on the back of the throttle that can be assigned as rudder control
Likely no. The joystick plugs in to the throttle with a PS/2 Connector, and the Throttle goes to the PC with USB. I haven't personally tried connecting the throttle to a PS/2 connector on my PC, but I don't imagine it'd work. Not sure why there's not a picture of the connectors on Amazon, but http://www.techwarelabs.com/reviews/peripherals/saitek_x52/images/Complete%20Contents%20saitek%20X52.jpg shows the connector types.
Both are 6 and 5/8 by 6 and 5/8. If your space is really that exact measurement with no leeway, they won't quite fit.
That is what I bought it for. It works great for me. You can also setup the profile in ED the way you prefer. Takes a little adjusting and tweeking. So when you first start in ED use the trainer to test and get all the buttons assigned the way you want. I did not like the canned ED setup for the X52. So I did a custom setup and tested in the trainer before using it in game. Good luck
I do not believe so. After checking on the Saitek website for drivers, you seem to only be able to download drivers for Windows.
Yes, though you will have to download the drivers from the Saitek website (Uses the same drivers for Vista, 7 and 8)
Hi ! I'm using it for windows 7 ultimate to play flight simulator x and steam . Is work very well . This product work with all version off windows.
Idk unfortunately but I sure hope so
It probably won't. When I tried to install my copy a few years ago onto XP, nothing I did would make it run. I don't know if anyone else would know how to fix it, but I had my comp master friend try it, and even he couldn't get it to work.
You will need to download a DOS emulator to run the game

Yes.
I do not think so; but I heard there was supposed to be an updated version.
No, there's no standard video DVD for it. It's too customized and complex of a program to run in a DVD player. It exists for PC, Play Station 2, xbox (the old one, but I think the new one might play it), and for the Wii under a different name. These are the only formats I'm aware of, and I've done quite a bit of research. I personally own the PC and Wii versions.
Ie either click on the icon or click on Start an click on word perfect.
So far, I haven 't had any real problems. A few things are a little different, but once you learn to navigate, it works well.
After seArching the internet several people say that it runs under :-P just fine But there were a few who had problems Installing pit should be the same as you install any software Make sure your on Xperia with admin rights
Everything but the Address book. I have tried eveything and the address book does not work
I have Windows 7 and WordPerfect 8 works fine for me.
No
I can't say for sure. I can tell you that this program has been able to open the Presentation documents (wpg) and word perfect documents (wpd) that were made by Corel suite 7 that was built for win95. I used it on win98, which was the last operating system that ver 7 would operate on.
I really don't know. WordPerfect licensing is less restrictive than other brands but I do know that WordPerfect Suite 8 is a very good inexpensive program for general word processing. I'll look in the literature that came with it when I get home and get back to you.
as long as you don't have windows 8 it should work fine. I hate it that I can't get it to work on mine with Windows 8 so solutions so far...
Works well with mine.
Yes
yes to both. no need to rotate. If I recall they even click together and stay put together. You can have a shadow like photo in the puzzle field to help place your pieces or you can have a small box/window up of the photo being worked on.
Yes, click on open on the drop down menu (file) first, then you will be asked if you want to save your current puzzle. After you answer you will be taken to the multiple lines of puzzle choices by theme.
the jigsaws galore isn't worth the money we paid for it I threw it away they did a poor job you are wasting your time to try to install it, go to big fish web site they have some jigsaw game to download very good ones they are called Jigsaw Boom 3 and jigsaw 365 not very expensive and they are real jigsaw puzzles very user friendly

To make matters worst when I received the console it did not come with any cords nor did the console work.
Yes. I used a genesis/Nes adaptor for mine that have two cords in one adaptor. Works great.
No sorry
I believe you would need TV and Power hookups if I'm not mistaken. You can look and find them on ebay.
The pictured is a model 1, and the model 2 is typically cheaper if ever so slightly. The model 3 tends to be more but not a whole lot more
Probably bc they have been lost along the way... the model 1 came out in 1989... gone with the wind I guess... or broke at some point
I'm not entirely sure what you are asking.... if you want to know what NORMALLY comes with a sega genesis should it be complete in the box you will need the following for it to be operational. The system itself, AV or Rca cables (Rca are pretty common today and are colored red white and yellow, while AV has a small box about half way down the cable and has a metal jack that screws into the T.V.), a power adapter and a controller. Obviously a game will be required for the system to be fully operational but luck for you genesis games that are popular happen to cost little to no money. You could probably get Sonic 1-3 for less than 20 bucks combined.
Depends on the listing. Some work some don't
No
Nawwwww
yes, I hooked it up to my 8.1 laptop and it worked just fine
I have the iomega USB KVM switch. My Saitek keyboard's lights worked fine. The trick is that I had it plugged into the USB port on the PC, turned the lights on, then plugged it into the KVM switch. Works fine!
Yes. My girlfriend bought one earlier this year for her Vista PC, and we just plugged it in the USB port and it worked. It still works fine to this day. She loves it. I personally own a Logitech G15, and it is better, but also costs more. In this $40 and under price range though, this Saitek is the best available. There are other illuminated keyboards you can get for this price or even less, but according to my research, they are not nearly as good. The Saitek should last you a good long time. Best bang for the buck in this category. My girlfriend paid $34 for hers at Walmart. I think they still carry them as of this writing.
Yes, that is the model I bought it for. I had no issues at all with it.
it works on all versions
No
Yes, this charger works well on my 3001 PSP. Not sure if it's just with mine, but it takes a bit of wiggling to pull it off the charger.
No, I don't think it is, but it worked fine and is still working fine.
Yes I have that kind
6volt I believe...
It comes with one controller but, you'll probably wanna buy another so it can charge while you play with the other. Also being that the controllers charge doesn't last as long as a new one.
If you get the CECH 01A then yes. Anything after, no.
No what I meant was that it was broken due to how it was treated by the owner. It plays ps3, ps2, and ps1 games just fine. No it does not play copied games.
yes and I forgot the model number sorry
I got the system, and power cord and a sony controller.
yes
You can purchase it from ebay or use the online manual.
I have no idea.
yes, I have windows 7, and had this game over 4 or 5yrs, lots of fun
Does this play in Window 7?

The wii mini doesn't have WiFi compability and backwards compability which lets it use gamecube controls and gamecube games
Yes it's the original wii
It should, my grandchildren uses just dance on the wii all the time
I mainly use my Wii for Netflix and Hulu. Such a good console for instant streaming.
Yes
I believe that the wii sports game was included.
Yes as long the title say wii If the title says wii U it won't work.
Yes
This is the original wii console. This console has 4 GameCube slot and two USB slot
Nope not even close. I consider this version better and more challenging
Short answer, yes. The offline experiance is much better if you finish the career first.
No
This version is not the black addition, and I am not sure if the black addition made it to the platinum
Yes. There a few cuss words in there, but not many and they're few and far between. Most Need For Speeds are fine because they're racing games so there's not much talking.
Yes
It sure is. One of the ONLY racing games that seem to be now a days....
What is ntsc
No, you'll need an original Xbox to play it

Yes.
Yes, it has 16 tracks exclusive to the DS version of Mario Kart and characters with different features.
Yes
Yes
Honestly, I'm not sure if dsi can play with a 3ds :/ but if it can I would first try it through one cartridge via the "download"play which js how you access multiplayer with one cartrige. If you are able to play with dsi and 3Ds then I would assume if you want to use all courses and characters you'd have to have another catridge. I'm not sure if you can do multiplayer with dsi and 3Ds :/ if you can let me know, that would be interesting.
Yes you can
It works the same. My son has the 3DS and this game works perfect on it.
I don't know what XML is. I know it works on DSi.

The prices are always changing on videogames. depends on the demand it has at the time of searching.. Most prices are alright. Though 1$, you can never beat that. 30$ is proabbaly for a brand new one, though buying used is always an alternative.
What do you mean by steam?
You may have to purchase counter strike source via steam but if you purchase the pic version then no it will not play on mac
mine came in the case as required
Yes it does I currently play on Windows 7.
Yes, offline with Bots
Your game files are curropted. Reinstall or try verify cache in steam (might need to Google it.)
If you buy it new yeah it's legit and you can play it. If you get it usd the key won't work and it won't let you play. I had to find out the hard way rather than going to steam and buying the game download direct.
Yes
What is your definition of mechanical? This keyboard is can be programmed, has a small led monitor, which I use all the time. Keys are lit and and you can run your dvd and volume. Plus it has a full number pad. You can create macro commands for gaming. Keyboard is a bit old school, but I like it.
This is indeed mac compatible. You would have to go to the logitech website and download drivers. However if you do not want to download said drivers it will still work just fine, the lcd will only have very basic functions and the G-keys will only perform default actions in whichever program you are in.
I just picked up the Razor and i have to say either i got a bad key board or this thing just sucks the big one. They keys are totally unresponsive when you type, unless you press down hard on them. Something about walking in the game and pausing every 3 steps because they keys arent decting that your actually pressing them. I wont even talk about the pvp experience excpet to say that my death was swift...or more swife then usual :) My roomate hopped on the computer to take care of some business and even he said that this key board bites the big one. He was attempted to type up some documents and asked if I could put my old key board back on so that he could actully get his work done due to the keys not responding when he used them. Guess i will purchase the G15 for my gaming experience because i am going to take this dam razor and use it to help improve my skeet shooting skills.
"or compatible"
Are the hardware requirements met?
I played and reviewed the game on Windows 7. The only Crazy Machines game that didn't work initially was Crazy Machines 2. I have reviews of these games on my website if you're interested (follow the link in my profile) as well as fixes for CM2.
It might be a little tricky for a 5 year old. I'm guessing this would be better for a child around 7-8 years old. That being said this is a pretty old game and we experienced problems with it on a newer (2004 iMac). Not sure if the same would apply for a windows PC but when we purchased it it was a "universal" powerpc binary and the windows version was for windows 95.
Find all the answers here http://www.steinschaden.fr/soluces/crazy_nc/crazync.htm For 53 pay particular attention to the length of the fuse as the distance from 8 ball to the bellows is affects when the ball will travel. The official solution has the domino falling onto right hand stump of the 'basket' and making a bridge with the hooks. The ball switches on the lamp. Also, make sure the solar panel is close enought to the light source, I think this is impotant, but not sure.

My question exactly. I also really enjoyed The Incredible Machine games and would like to know if this is (1) a worthy successor (2) a blatant rip-off (3) a new twist on an oldie but goodie.
are you still stuck on 85, I just got past it
Yes ... I solved all but 5 of the 200 levels on my own ... but was stuck on a few of them so I searched for some solutions ... here are two great websites with pictures and text solutions for all of the levels. Don't give up too soon .. but if stuck they can get you moving again. Both sites are in German, but you can figure the solutions out either using the pictures or using a website translator. Good Luck. http://home.tiscali.de/troll/cm/index.html http://www.cm-fanpage.de/board/index.php
we are stuck at 16 also, wondering if there is a mistake on this one??

I'm pretty sure it will. I use it with the amazon app on Xbox and also my local cable providers app.
The one I received its the same as pictured. Great remote for using the 360 as a media centre.
It is 8.25" long X 1" thick X 1.75 to 2" wide at the tip. Just like the picture.
Yes
I bought 2 of these (from a different seller) in 9/2013 and they both had the green mce button. Go for it, if it doesn't have it then return it.
I haven't tried using this remote on my computer yet, but my old computer remote I had, worked on my 360. So I would think it should work. It obviously sends out the same signals. It is made by Microsoft, so why wouldn't it work with the computer?
Works great with wmc extender. It's what I use it for.
If you have an adapter for a VGA input yes. Mac uses other inputs depending on what year your mac is.
If your monitor has a VGA input, it should work.
It will work with an Xbox 360 elite
no it even comes with an adaptor to do so.
Non digital tv- picture? If it has a female VGA port then it should work. The red and white is for a separate sound output. So like speakers. You can also get av to aux 3.5mm cord.
If the back of your Xbox 360 has a port that looks like the trapezoidal one in this picture (http://www.spainsellers.com/images/Xbox-360-Slim.jpg), then it SHOULD work, but no guarantees. I would suggest an HDMI cable instead of this, if the monitor/screen you're trying to connect to has an HDMI port.
I am using it on a 360S
Not with this cable. I tried a couple other aftermarket ones that were terrible. The Microsoft one is the real deal.
It sucks, don't buy it.
Yes
Yes. At some point they switched from this AV cable to an HDMI. This is the original cable that was packaged with the first couple revisions of the console.
Unfortunately no simply because it's not a spliter. There is a tiny switch on it to change from the HD mode and standard. It's one or the other.
Yes and certain games like mine craft need it to use multi player
You answered your own question actually; it is only able to use an HDMI cable. AV/Component output is not supported for that model so this product would serve you no purpose.
I'm going to guess that it comes from creative marketing. Most likely they are referring to the fact that the audio outputs can be connected to a surround sound to achieve 5.1.
should be in the back near the HDMI input
The yellow cable is for standard definition television . plugging it in won't do anything. You have your audio cables (red and white) and your HD componet cables (Red green blue) and standard definition video cable(yellow) if you are not using an HD TV with component plugs such as an CRT TV the yellow video cable needs to be plugged in to the color coded slot (sometimes represented as a Y above another color slot)
Ensure that the correct color connectors on the component end are plugged into the correct TV jacks, verify the switch on the Microsoft connector is set to HDTV, on the TV set the video selection to the appropriate input. Remember that the solid red and white plugs are the left and right audio, if still having problems the cable could be bad. Good luck!
No
it is downloaded. I have the same disc downloaded on two different laptops.
Amazon Forwarded This As I Purchased Pretty Goo Solitaire For This PurposE. I Am Very Happy With It. Many Games At Different LevEls Of Play. Play Everyday And Love It. Just Load The Cd And YOu Get An Icon And Then Select To Play. When You Find A GaMe You Like Just Minimize It And It Is There To Be Played Again.
Yes it does have a tripeaks version called Triple Peaks in the Regular games folder
This version has several spider games and the original too. This should be great for you.
Yes, it has both of them
no
Yes, they call it Klondike in this edition.
Found Number 10 and Buffalo Bill. Pretty good solitaire is terrific, has simple games and games that require a calculus degree. There are hundreds and hundreds of games and you can get new ones if you own the software. Enjoy! The perfect solitaire CD for any solitaire fan.
I didn't see one, if it has one it can be turned off.---Yank

I'm using Windows 8.1 and it works great. You won't be able to stay on the game with CTRL/Tab, but if you save and restart every time you stop playing it will do fine.
Yes it will work with Win 7. Plenty of people still play Sims 1 with Win 7, and I haven't heard anything about any installation problems. If you run into any, try installing it as an administrator.
No. This is the PC version. You'd have to buy the MAC version. Just search 'The Sims Complete Collection Mac' I'm pretty sure there is in a Mac version for The Sims.
My used copy doesnt seem to have any problems, after i installed it, it acted ask it should, all expansions were there and working bring back memories of the good old days, just go by there possiative rating and how many good rating it has,
I don't believe it has apartment life, but I was sorely disappointed with my entire purchase of the expansion packet. I could not register any of it because they were all used
Yes. It comes with all the expansions.
No. You might be able to get it to work but you have to do some major work with tech support.
Yes. Just browse under "The Sims Complete Collection Download" and select from the available sites. I personally haven't downloaded any games, so I can't give you any further details. Hope this helps.
Yes
Yes. I have GTA: SA on my computer which is running Windows 8 Pro...it runs perfectly, and without any incompatibility issues. The game doesn't have any lagging on my computer either.
I purchased the second edition and had no problems running mods, first edition will also run them, so its up to personal preference
I would try to install using compatibility mode then try to run game in compatibility mode. If that doesn't work try running directly from install folder in compatibility mode and as administrator. Some games will not work on 8.1 though.
You download it.
You can choose which version you would like to buy. You can choose to buy the disc or the downloaded copy
I think the second edition is less graphic
I don't know. Maybe so
The game can work anything over Windows.XP. and it does work on vista. I had it installed on my vista
Depends how much memory your computer may have. Best if you get like an 8 gig USB drive or an external hard drive if your not sure how much memory your computer have. It really shouldn't take much memory these days since computers come with a alot memory.
I am on the same situation with the Palm Tungsten T5. They never mentioned Palm OS as compatible :-(
I'm trying now, will update if successful.

It includes; Galaga and Galaxian.
Per nintendo.com......Almost all existing Nintendo DS and Nintendo DSi games can be played on the Nintendo 3DS family of systems in 2D. With backwards compatibility, your existing portable games look and play just as well*.
no, it is not.
Sorry, I have a DSi. It works perfect on that. Haven't used a 3DS yet. Hope you get a resolution to your problem! Have a great weekend!
yes that is what I have
I do not know mine was in English. If their was something different my grandson would have said something
Yes
We used it in a DSI and know nothing about the XL system. I would call game stop or Nintendo to get correct info, sorry I could not be of more help.
Yes! :)

I don't have mine yet but from what I've read, most games will be compatible. Many newer games are even being made with this specific controller in mind so that helps.
Yes it does. I actually can't distinguish it from the others so I wrote "PC" on the back of mine with sharpie so I wouldn't get them confused
They're the real deal, no worries.
Yes, they will.
Nope
HDMI cable will not fit under this monster cable
No, it isn't a HDMI cable. It has a bigger end which the older Xbox 360's (white ones) have.
If you are using a TV with a component video input (Red, Blue, Green) then it will work but if it does not then it will not. This is a component only cable. I would recommend going with a cheaper composite option if your TV doesn't have a component video input.
hdmi
This does not come with an optical output. You have to purchase the fiber optic cable made specifically for the X Box 360 which comes with the needed adapter in order for this cable to output Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.
Hi, you know it would take some practice but I think you could. Take a look at some of the cometing designs too, Belkin and Logitec spring to mind. Pick one that has mouse functionality on it, and with some experimentation and practice you should find it possible to return to WoW. Best of Luck, I hope it works out for you.
Yes
The macro assigning is done thru software that comes with the unit, or downloaded off saiteks site
It is an analog sick and the switches are membrane
No. Also it is not compatible with home consoles. Windows only. I must note you that the Saitek Cyborg is much old and outdated now, discontinued by Saitek before PS4 time. I suggest you to look up on Razer Orbweaver Elite.
Against the older Razer gamepads based on the Nostromo design, this is a MUCH better game pad. It is very comfortable and responsive. The software is a little more difficult to use, but its easy enough if take your time and experiment with the setup. I cannot comment on the newer Razer Orbweaver/Tartarus, as I have not used them. However, they still look similar to the Nostromo designed pads.
according to nintendo's web site, it will work for the wii and ds. just check the shopnintendo site.
only on Metroid prime: hunters so far. And only with your friends.
No, from what I've heard it only works with XP. There are other usb connectors that will work with vista and 7 and macs, like the one from Planex.
no
No. If you have a wireless connection, chances are you don't need anything else. I did, however, as I am using a free-wireless connection and don't have access to the main router. I just hooked the connector to my laptop and created a Nintendo-exclusive access point for both my DS and Wii.
No doubt because of the scare tactics. I wouldn't say it's scary, though it might be to someone who's younger than thirteen, really. Also, the backstory is a little morbid, when you go into looking through newspaper articles and whatnot in-game.
Probably not, since it doesnt say Extended Cut.
Yes, I can play it on Windows 8 with all the latest patches. If I remember correctly, tho', you need the origin libraries/app installed as well, but I could be wrong about that.
No, this hasn't been ported to consoles yet. Also, I recommend buying Spore through Steam in case you get a faulty key like I did
Yes it does. I believe I had to go in as the administrator after installation and force it to run in Windows XP mode, but have had absolutely no problems running this game on Windows 8.
We couldn't install the game. The product code provide with game didn't work. Waiting on refund now. I had to pay return postage.
Yes. Best to install it using origin.
Yes it does, I run it in Windows 8 myself. It was designed to run on Windows XP and Vista so there may be the occasional crash, but I have had very few problems once I installed it as the administrator and forced it to run in the Windows XP format. Very fun game, hope you enjoy it as much as I have!
Yes, you only need the internet to load the game. It may warn you that no internet connection is available, but it is not necessary once the game has been installed.
It does but I recommend purchasing it through origin.
Yes I have played it before on there many times and works with all high settings.
I do not know - we have Windows 7. Sorry I couldn't help.
My Printmaster Gold 17 would not work with Windows 8, so I am using it on another computer with Windows XP. I ordered Platinum for my Windows 8 computer and I am very unhappy with it. Most cards are without text.
I am using it with windows 7. So, Yes.
Yes you can and it's a fairly simple process. Instead, however, I would recommend going to this site and it is magnificent at creating calendars with various that you may want or need: http://www.calendarlabs.com/printable-calendar.php?template=tL1m A W Radle
Yes you can - it's rather simple. Open the PM program. A "desk top" type Print Master page will appear. There will be a series of icons across this page that do various things. In the lower right corner will be an icon for "Open My Projects" - click on that and it will open the folder with all of your saved projects.
NO
I don't think the game is region locked. If that's what you mean.
No, its ps3 exclusive currently
Yes
yes
we don
If appropriate for a child of eight years since it has no bloody scenes or sex
4
Yes
yes
Yes
It should I don't see why not...
As long as it is Wii not Wii U
The game's messed up. Something about how they made it that causes it to break after awhile. Went through like 3 already
yes he will learn to play super smash bros.brawel. I have a5 year old grand son that learn how to play all Mario's game. I also gave him a logo game and his now doing 10 years old logo game, and his only 5 years old. buy it for your son and you will find out how much a 5 year old kid knows. carlos nieves/
I've never had that problem with the game
No it is not you just need to send it back and then get another one because it might have scarches on it so send it back get another one and see if it does the same thing and then hit me back

Cecilia I wish I could help,but this was a gift for our Grandson who lives in Tennesse and we live in Plattsburgh New York,I am not a gamer and he is on the go all the time ,so I don't hear from him.
No I haven't had any issues with it and I'm nearly 3/4 through the game. Does your disk have scratches/dirt? if so you may want to take a cotton ball and some rubbing alcohol and thoroughly clean the disk.
Im not sure I bought the actual game
Full Game.
Yes, it comes with both the intsaltion disc and the game disc!!!!!!
From what I've learn, no it does not
What do you mean the one below it?
No it is not!
It worked on my Windows 7 computer. I haven't tried it on 8.1 yet.
It happened to me and I couldn't reinstall mine either I wish I knew how
No product key is assigned to each software it will either not complete the installation or crash upon use sorry have tried with other products
Full installation; but, this version is for use on XP machines ---&gt; doesn't work on modern Windoze boxes --- need version specific to -7 or -8 and/or -64 bit, if using those machines. Install this version on newer machines and computer will respond with, "Are you talking to me?"
I don't know, I run the program with windows
Yes
my copy was a cd and would not work with windows 7, it helps if you use some kind of joystick as you can get behind the helicopter using a keyboard, hope that helps
I have heard that some Mac's can run Windows. So, unless your Mac is running Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8, I would have to say no.
Should run fine, graphics may be a little "off", as in detail/resolution. Would recommend a check with MS's website to see if any "patches" are required for Win 8.1.
I've never had the program crash, in win 7. The graphics are improved is some areas but still have along way to go. The instruments are harder to read than they were in ver. 2002

Yes, it works PERFECTLY with the Playseat Evolution. (Not sure about earlier generation Playseats.) The Evo has pre-drilled holes that line up with the bottom of your G25 wheel platform and your G25 pedal platform, though you will have to offset the Evo pedal panel quite a bit to where it's strange looking but not impractical from a functional standpoint. Look into buying the additional Playseat Evo attachment for the G25 shifter. I don't think Amazon sells it ... I ended up getting that attachment from MaxWho.com.
Unfortunately the Logitech G25 is only compatible with PC and the PS3. From what I know there is no XBOX support from any Logitech racing wheels.
Yes
Yes
I've only used it with grand torismo, but I'm sure it will work with all driving games. Only compatible with Play Station.
G25/G27 is not compatible with the Xbox 360. You're somewhat limited in selection of wheels for the 360, but I'd recommend a Fanatec wheel. Preferably the multiplatform 911 Turbo S (clutch/H-shifter), but check their site out for yourself and see: www.fanatec.com Microsoft's wheel is decent to start out with, but if you're playing Forza 3 I'm sure you'll eventually want more. Also, there was an excellent wheel shootout at www.insidesimracing.tv I know you asked the beginning of Dec, but on chance you haven't made up your mind I hope it helps. Good luck.
gtr is good but if you play online get rfactor ps try some demos
I have been wondering this exact same thing for a while now. Of course I already have the wheel, lol, so doesn't matter. Really need to start getting it set up since the game comes out in about a 10 days.
It's a catch 22. Any PS2/PS3 wheel will work for Dirt, but you won't want to use it. There is significant steering lag with Dirt. Which means your going straight and your car is still turning, it makes for a very frustrating experience. Can't speak for how it runs on the 360 but on the PC it'll run good if you have a very powerful PC. Your best bet is to stick with a controller if you only have the PS3 version.
yes, on ps3
Nope.. It's all pre wired. Just open the case on your console. Then unplug the old Stock Xbox fan. After that replace it with the talismoon fan. Now then your going to want to test the fan by turning on your Xbox and make sure it works. If it works correctly you can now put the console back together. and... TADAAA! You've successfully installed your new fan. Hope this helps! :) (I'm 12)
Yes, it has the 4 pin connection for the old xenon motherboards.
Not that I'm aware of you better off with the stock fans and if they are bad just get new versions ...my whisper fans started getting bearing scream so just go with stock ones !!!&#128512;
Yes, it works with the older xbox core system. It does increase air flow and it looks neat in the process. Its not going to stop a rrod system from red ringing but it should help a system to not get it in the first place.
It's been over a year since I installed this on my elite. What little I remember is that everything matched up fine. Maybe different versions have different fan plugs? Hopefully someone here has opened up several original model 360s to verify this.
no fan is in a diff spot and it is smaller on 360E...srry
No this is for the original "fat" system
Yes, it works. You may need to load a custom XML using the console.
my scale said 5.4 lbs.
Not only do the control NWS, they can also control differential braking
IDK either ... I bought it and got the standard version. I do not see much difference except for the metal on the pedals which maybe makes them more durable. I use the pedals with Windows XP as my OS; the interface of my pedals is USB, the Saitek Drivers get the pedals into my computer and Saitek includes a program to check that the pedals are working. BUT to get the pedal info into any running program they have to be linked to the Windows Device Manager by going to the Control Panel and Clicking on Game Controllers, then clicking on ADD then scroll down to Saitek and select it. I made a screen shot but Amazon does not give me a way to attach it to this e-mail.
Yes, but if you're trying to use FSX you're going to have problems.
We don't know of any list but he uses this specifically for Elite Dangerous. He says the rudder pedals can be programmed to any game just like a joystick.
Not sure what the warranty is on this but I have had no issues with it so far. Amazon is great about backing up the products they sell and allowing returns if needed.
Yes that's how I have them hooked up
They don't mention HID compliant on the box or in the instructions, but it comes with driver software and you can personalize your setup.
Yes
If your system has an optical cable, such as the PS 3, all you have to do is unplug the optical cord from the subwoofer and plug that into the same port on your other system.
Should be.Just use the optical ports from the Pioneer plug it in using the provided toslink cable to the Xbox 360 HD Cable. There is no need to have your Red and White audio jack in the TV. The Xbox 360 will effectively bypass sending audio to the TV and will send the digital audio signal directly to the Pioneer. Then have fun. But if you want your TV to have surround sound make sure it is connected (Audio out) to the Pioneer.
Just connect a 3.5mm to RCA cable to the back of the woofer (receiver) and set the input to analog.
i have them both hooked up
No, I only have one
Subwoofer: 100W x 1 (RMS 10% THD@100Hz)
mine works just fine. Be advised that all xbox control go through the IR port on the xbox itself (not the pioneer receiver). Make sure that you have a direct line between this port and the remote and try wiping the IR port on the 360 as it have have collected too much dust. The other option is that the IR port on your 360 simply is defective. I doubt it would be the remote or anything with the pioneer system since it performs it independent functions.
This system (as far as I could read) has only Audio inputs. HDMI is an audio and video cable. If you are trying to connect this to an HDTV that has an HDMI input, then chances are that it has Digital Audio output too. Simply hook this digital output to the sound system. there will be some finer tweaks you need to workout with the tv such as whether the tv volume controlls the output volume and if the TVs speakers should then be turned off. For more personallized help, most High school to college aged boys/men, and an increasing number of women, have the knowlege required to get it working at a livable level. usually a trip to a Best Buy with a list of the items you have including brand and model number can prove very helpfull too.
This unit as far as I have read has a conventional RCA Plug style red and white stereo input that would work with an original Xbox flawlessly if you use the supplied Composite A/V cable for the xbox. As far as getting 5.1 surround sound from that connection I am unsure. I am sure that there is an adapter somewhere that plugs into the xbox and outputs a digital sound signal of either optical or coaxial types.
this cannot be used with any other receiver/amp, as it has a built in amp inside the subwoofer.
No.
Indeed it does, without any issues or driver installs. Works right out of the box.
Yep. Works with games that use controllers like skyrim
You can sync up to four to the computer just like the 360, each controller will also have difference light position light up. I've tried up to 3, only have 3 controllers. Source can also be found here, first paragraph. http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/connections/xbox-360-wireless-gaming-receiver-windows
I use mine regularly in Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit. It was plug and play.
Yes, in fact I myself have used it on my Macbook. I used this guide to set it up: http://www.maclife.com/article/howtos/how_use_xbox_360_wireless_controller_your_mac Happy Gaming :)
I'm testing it out right now, it was recognized after a reboot in emulationstation. The usb was just recognized after installing the driver from retropie_setup.sh. This is on RetroPie 2.4.2
Minecraft for PC never came with a gamepad option, you'll need to use a program called JoyPad to play MC... But that goes for any gamepad not just this.
No. But there are drivers available for the Xbox one controller so that you can use it with a USB cable. http://majornelson.com/2014/06/05/pc-drivers-for-the-xbox-one-controller-available-now/
Yes. I run Windows 7 ultimate 64bit and it works just fine.
Works great for me and I have the most recent update for mac
No sorry you need to buy those expansions seperately
It should! Check the system requirements to be sure. It does need a disc drive though so you'll need to get an external one if you don't have one already.
yes
It is a disc.
yes, it should!
Yes, this is the base pack for AEIII. Once loaded you can add War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties. It's a fun game.
Alan, i can't really answer your question. The copy of this game that i have for sale is $150.00. The reason it is priced at $150.00 is that based on the other copies available at the time I listed it $150.00 seemed like a fair price based on what other seller were asking for their copies. Beyond that, I'm at a loss. I don't play video games and don't really know what an Expansion Pack involves and so I've no idea why they only cost $5.00. Perhaps there is less to them than the game itself.
Yes, but always ask the seller to confirm this.
I don't think so, I believe you have to buy an adapter for it.
Yes but not ds2 or later games
Yes, you can play DS games from Germany on a US Nintento DS and vice versa because the Nintendo DS is region free so you can play any games from any region on your console. You can set the language when you set up your DS.
Ds games and games boy advance sp games. The ds games go on top in the back the small slot and the Gameboy advance games go on the bottom.

I bought this little camera about a year ago and it look cheap but by accident washed twice and still working. The Instructions come in Chinese but I didn't need them lol. So yes it works !!
Not that i know of....
Compatible models are "PSP-1000 Series / PSP-2000 Series / PSP-3000 series". this is written in SONY's official website.
in a word, Yes.
Yes
If you have tile or hardwood floors it doesn't slip! It kind of has a non slip grip at the bottom to help.
No
If your asking does it have a reaction delay, we have never noticed one. Excellent DDR pad. It gets ton of use at my house. No complaints yet
Mine came with one controller
It does not. It has limited access to the Internet in general.
Absolutely!
They appear to be but then I can't get mine to play in color on my HD TV, so I'm not 100% certain.
The ones we bought were bought used a few years ago and all cables required to play were included. The PS2 system is no longer made and good quality used units are harder to find now. Good luck!
Yes the gamecontrols is inclued
SCPH 90001 CB / 97706
The game controller is also used as Dvd / Blu-ray remote, it does not come with any other remote.
if your asking about the wires to connect the console to the television, the answer is yes.

Yes. My friend played it on windows 8. If any problems arise, you can always right click the game and go to "properties" and find the ability to run the game as an ealier edition of windows. Also, check out aoe2 hd. You might prefer it. Good luck.
usually works fine on my Windows 7 system. It does fail sometimes due to DirectDraw error.
Not very well, go for the new HD release on Steam.
You can install the game on an unlimited number of computers and LAN with buddies without needing the disc in any of the computers!
I have windows 7 but not sure what kind of video card I have. The game works fine for me.
sorry not that I know of
I will not try yet, but that could not be it, I think so, you must need it than both computers have the same version to could play!
NO.
Yes Windows 7, but it is full screen, no window. F3 can pause the game, but you have to get the volume level right before you start because you can't adjust it during the game.
I don't believe it comes in a download form. Mine came in a disc pack. It also plays without a play-disc so it can be loaded on all of your computers.
It would be nice if there were another sale here soon. After all, Race Pro is coming out for the 360 next week, and it caters to a simulator crowd (who tend to spend money on things like this). I'm in this category, and frankly, the first company to put the Evolution on a good sale will get my money. I'd like it to be Amazon, but if it is someone else, so be it.
There's a $50 off code good until mid-May, UKM8Y7AH
It seems strange to me too, every time I look at this chair it is a different price. I found plans to build one with a more solid frame, that you can use a regular car seat from a junk yard, for $80 in parts if you have a welder. I may try that before buying this chair with its high markup in price.
It has the plate you see in the picture of it and you screw the steering wheel down onto it as tight as you can get. The wheel I have has the shifter as part of the overall assembly. The wheel pedal kit I bought is a M/N E-X5C 19 model number that has the shifter and wheel as one plastic assembly. I went to Logitech and the picture they show for the G27 is a totally separate shifter and there is no way to mount it on what I have. There may be an adapter you can buy but I don't know. Good luck and enjoy. I really like the seat. It is so comfortable when you get tired yo can just nap right in it. :-)
Hey Ritchie, did you ever find out? I was planning to do the same thing (check it on a flight). Thanks Raph
No its adjustable enjoy!
Yes you do have to use both feet with this game seat because of the post that holds the base where you attach the wheel. I wouldn't let that bother you that much unless you are trying to get serious for real life racing there they use the toe/heel for gas and brake. I can tell you that I really like the seat even though I don't use it that often. I recently built a platform to mount it on and put small caster wheels on the bottom of it so I can easily move it around the room. I also ended up making a stop at the top of the pedals as they didn't want to stay in place as good as I would have liked. If I needed to buy another one this would be my choice. Good luck and I hope you enjoy it.
Should work as long as the Thrustmaster wheel has a table (flat surface) type clamp as do most wheels
This is exactly what I did, but you'll need to modify them slightly. I got two gear shift holders, the base on the gear shift holders is too small for a flight stick / throttle to sit on so what I did was cut some particle board, drilled holes in it so I can mount it on top of the gear shift holders, laid some black leather (from hobby lobby) across the wood (to make it match seat) and then put some plexiglass pieces on top of it so my throttle/stick suction cups have something to stick onto. Overall it works GREAT. Used it to for Ace Combat 6, Hawxx, and many other PC flight sims.
You can, no problems right foot braking.

It's the exact same controller included with and sold for the xbox 360. The included receiver is only needed for Windows.
Yes it does. You do not have to purchase a separate receiver.
No
It will work with any xbox 360 wireless controller and up to 4 controllers can be connected at a time.
yeah, i installed the disc and it works fine
One of the reviews claimed that there were unofficial Mac drivers that worked well. But I don't know from personal experience. Your best bet would probably be to Google it.
The 49.99 version comes with a usb reciever you can plug into your computer. The cheaper one cannot be used on your pc unless you buy the reciever sepratley.
I played on windows 8 and it seemed to handle it alright, but I think I had to change some computer settings.
Yes, its a Cd-Rom game.. and it's a really fun/spooky point and click :-)
No. You have a choice of single play, or 3,4,5,10,15,25,50 and 100 play.
Cannot answer your question. Did not care for this and threw it away shortly after getting it. Bought WinPoker through Amazon instead which we are very happy with.
I don't know. It stopped working on my PC, so I uninstalled it. When I tried to remove the disk from its holder in the case, it was so hard to remove that I cracked it in the center about half inch. I tried to reload it into my PC several times, but nothing ever happened. However, I would think that the disk could be downloaded to as many computers as you wished. Francine
Right now I have windows 7 so I dont know. you can go to the website and ask the source. He answered my emails and even updated my software when improvements were made.
Elite Dangerous is the main reason I bought the x52 pro, Elite does have a config for the x52 pro however it is missing the one or two different buttons. They are easy enough to config and If you want to use the "clutch button" "I" you will need to disable clutch mode in the x52 control panel. The x52 pro it self is amazing for Elite Dangerous, I have had mine for a few months now and haven't had any problems. The HOTAS used in the cockpits are almost exactly the same as this one so if you are using an oculus rift it is quiet immersive. http://youtu.be/JOoiEhOBcT8 for a review on this product that I did awhile back.
The answer is that it needs to be secured some way--especially the throttle. I went to Walmart and bought the sticky-back strip Velcro they have, stuck 2 strips of the pile side on my bench, and two matching strips of the hook part onto the throttle base and it works well. I don't secure the stick because it's heavier--occasionally if I get "ham-fisted" it lifts up slightly, but I just sit it back down and it's OK. Now if you have a very smooth desktop for the throttle, maybe the suction cups supplied with the throttle will hold it down, but my surface is unfinished wood, so the suction cups are not effective.
Yes, works with xp, vista, 7 and 8 - may have to download the proper version from their website, http://saitek.com/
Yes! Actually the main piece is the throttle part. The stick is cabled to the throttle using a Saitek proprietary cable so you will be ok if using a different stick and have this one as a backup. Another tip: don't use the throttle in a raw wood, if you do this the throttle will hot hold the position when you will use it. Nothing that can avoid the use but using it in a glass or solid table is the must considering you can use the 'suckers' (haha I don't know the name in english).
Yeah, the sick has twist for yaw/rudder control. Even has a twist lock if you plan to use it with rudder pedals. I would recommend that you mag mod the stick though as the stock sensitivity isn't all that great. It's a simple mod, and makes a world of difference (YouTube for tutorials) if you sent scared to fiddle with the stick innards.
Was like 22 x 12 x 9 something like that. Not massive. But not,tiny by any,means
stick, throttle, cable between the two, USB cable to computer, CD, and a quick start pamphlet--make sure you read ALL the reviews--this system can be tricky to get working, depending upon your system
No
It's pretty intuitive, and there are tutorials on line. Be sure to use the software from the website though, and not the CD version that comes with the stick.
Yes, any button can be programed
Perfect For Project M , I Got This Very SD Card Just For It And Works Fine
No but it can be used to store more games than on the Wii hard drive.
No. Definitely not. Regular SD. Not SDHC
Mine came in that hard-to-open, melted-together, too-big-for-the-product plastic packaging.
Nothing at all. You are not paying for all the non-recyclable plastic waste for individual unit packaging.
This mouse DOES entirely work on OS X. They sell a white lit version labeled as the OS X version but all Death Adder mice are the exact same no matter what color they are. The only difference is you'll have to download the OSX driver from the website because there are only PC drivers on the disk.
black. It's probably the flash on cameras that make it look grey. It's the color of the mouse itself you need to watch out for. Or you'll end up with non matching glows.
Yes it is, because I am using it for my laptop.
I haven't got to compare them, but the Copperhead in terms of performance is definitely better, but a lot of (right handed people) people might prefer the Death Adder because of the right-handed design. I own a Copperhead, it is the mouse to slay all other mice in terms of sheer performance, so slacking a little on performance really isn't that big of a deal. If I wasn't a lefty I'd probably prefer the Death Adder.
Yes! I use it on 8.1! Works fine download joytokey if you don't know what to do!
No it wouldn't. You would have to get an official Gamecube to Wii U adapter
Yes just plug and play
yes. my computer actually auto-downloaded the drivers(windows, sorry). google 3 in 1 magic joy box drivers and you should get there.
None at all
i have NO IDEA, i would like to ask what makes everyone think i have all the answers, i as ONE question in the past and i get asked questions, in what world does that make ANY sense...
I'm going to assume you mean can multiple people use this at once. No, you cannot.
Yes, it does work, it doesn't care what controller you're using, you just set up the controls through your emulator and play. No special configuring.
It does allow for multiple controllers at the same time. Its worked for me with GCB and a ps1 ckbtroller . but I assume ps2 and Xbox would work too
Yes. I bought it to use with a Mac and a GameCube controller and it worked as soon as I plugged it in. I was using it to play Dusy: An Elusian Tail, which is designed for an Xbox controller so the button mapping was off but I think that's a consequence of the game.
I was not able to get it working on Windows 7. I had to install a virtual machine running Windows 95 in order to play.
Although Timelapse was originally designed for Windows 3.1 or Windows 95; with regard to WindowsXP, it runs best (without lockups or crashes) when the "Compatibility Mode" is set to WindowsNT 4.0 with Service Pack 5.
I don't think so. And I haven't found a patch for it yet.

Yes and No. PS2 controllers and peripherals will only work on PS2 software/games. That is if the PS2 software is compatible with the PS3. I have not found any PS2 accessories that will work for PS3 software/games. There is backwards compatibility. PS3 controllers will work for PS2 games. With the exception of the PS3 Move Controllers, most PS3 controllers will operate most PS2 software.
I highly doubt it. The connector is PS specific.
No this will not work on X-box
Yes it does it works on every ps3
I don't know with dance pads. I only used a wireless EA Sports PS2 controller with this and it worked flawlessly. I don't have a dance pad to try for you. Sorry.
Didn't work for my PS2 to PS3 so I doubt it.
is 2014 if you are still looking to use ps2 gear for ps3 .........it does work i dont know about guitar hero but fifa 2012 worked fine...
Definitely! In fact, that's why I bought it, so I could game on my PC with a PS2 emulator.
Yes, but please note that controller may not be compatible with all PS3 games.
I didn't see if the analog button was mapped as ps3 button. However it might be since ps3 uses analog all the time. I was using my PS3 Blu Ray remote to go to PS3 menu
Yes. It came with everything.
Not if you buy the PC version. It needs to be the MAC version to run on a MAC. You can tell which version it is by looking on the upper left hand side of the cover.
you must first turn off any virus protection, then you download using the autorun that should work
Yes. I have Windows 7 (American) and this deluxe is compatible. Hope I helped!
Well, the Sims 2 is the same thing as Double Deluxe, just without the expansion packs. So, no, you don't need the double deluxe if you have the Sims 2 base game.
It didn't work on my windows 8. So I don't think so.
It worked on my windows 8 laptop, so it may work on windows 8.1
Yes
Yes
I never downloaded anything, but I guess you could retry it. If that doesn't work, re-install the game, or call customer support.
No just component, red, green, blue, then white and another red for audio. NO HDMI
No, this is not compatible with the Gamecube. However, you can play Gamecube games in progressive scan using this cable on a Wii.
I looked up your television model you only have one slot for component cables just plug in the matching colors red to red white to white green to green blue to blue etc. Cables work great. Make sure to change wii settings to 480p under settings
Not sure about the wii u. I used it on my wii
No.
I'm not sure. My son ordered it, & he's not available to ask. Wish I could be of more help!
That is something that would most likely be in your TV's menu. Try finding the menu button on your TV remote, then find the picture setting. There should be an option to decrease brightness in there.
The Wii Mini only supports the regular composite cables (red, white, and yellow) unfortunately.
No it does not
Adjust your TVs zoom settings. If your TV lacks those, adjust the Wii's over scan settings. If THAT doesn't work, get a better TV.
No, at least mycopy didn't come with it. You have to buy it off the XBOX Live Marketplace.
It depends on which version you order now. As of today, they release the trilogy all together now where some of the bonus content is included. Before purchasing, I'd do more research to make sure. This one I ordered did not though. Find the trilogy where it's all of them together and you may be able to find the package where each game has its bonus content included! :-)
For X360: Actually, the trilogy box set only has one DLC (for the first Mass Effect) that actually costs around $1-$5 by itself. With Mass Effect 2, there's the Cerberus Pass (which was once only available with a new purchase, but can now be downloaded from the Xbox Live Marketplace) and half of the DLC is free (go to Xbox Marketplace, find Mass Effect 2 DLC, and download Cerberus Network which is free, and you can download DLC from it which includes a new character, weapons armies and extra missions). Mass Effect 3 DOES need an Online Pass for online play, but some people were able to bypass this by having Xbox Live. Unfortunately, in both the trilogy and by itself, Mass Effect 3 contains NO DLC at all. The only free DLC is downloaded from Xbox Live Marketplace (it's add-ons for multiplayer, extra places to fight and more choices of bad guys to fight against). Every other DLC is not free. It doesn't actually matter which one you buy, as the only difference is the Bring Down the Sky DLC. Overall, the trilogy has only one DLC that isn't quite expensive while separately there are none. But if price matters, buy all three separately, as it can be cheaper sometimes by finding the right sellers. This may be kind of confusing but I hope I helped.
Yes it can.
I got a case with mine that had a paper on the tiger woods golf inside and on the back of that paper is thecode number...I hope this helps let me know
Tiger woods pga tour 08 only works with windows xp and windows vista. You should find out about a newer version in www.easport.com that applies to Apple. Sorry for delayed answer but I was traveling in the northern part of my country which is Argentina, South America
I don't know for sure - I was using windows 7., 64 bit and it seemed to work ok. There were some bugs and hang ups but it eventually worked ok
Yes it will play on Win7 x64, I do daily.
yes- it plays on win 8.1 - but depending on your video card- for some reason there are some ati cards that cannot run tw8- if you have Nvidia you should have no problems. also look for the mod that allows you to run the game 1920x1080 if you have wide screen monitor, search for 'Universal Widescreen Patcher' its a simple utility and it works. also goto course source . com for hundreds and hundreds of user made courses- better than the ones that came with game.
it will arrive in the official Microsoft Xbox package
3. two front, 1 rear of original design (white or black). 4. two front, two rear of Slim. Using rear ports loses at least 15" of distance from haveing to wrap around the rear of the xbox and up a side.
Nope you can't. I tried doing this but the receiver had to be connected.
According to the pckaging it's a 9 foot cord.
It will charge through PC. In order to use the actual controller through the PC, you need the Microsoft adapter. I bought this item and the adapter; works great. Still cheaper than buying a wired usb controller, although those are good too.
Yes. It basically turns your controller into a wired controller without the battery pack. But you can also put in the rechargeable battery pack and charge it to play wirelessly.
Yes, it's a standard microsoft battery, works great with any microsoft charge kits like the duel black MS charge station.
It's a battery and a charger, so it's a great value. Sorry, but I don't know the mAh. I'd look at other reviews for more detail
both. the idea is that this would normally be used for a PC.
It sure will. If you already own an Xbox 360 and the 360 controller (as it should have come with) then the cord will act as a charger and you'll also have an extra battery pack.
I got my husband, who is the owner of the game to help me with the answer. Unfortunately NO, that particular game does not have trophies. A particular good way that you can determine even before you purchase your game is to look very closely on the back cover of your games hard case. In the very top portion of the paper label (top Rh corner) opposite the Playstation Network name it will say (ADD ON CONTENT) and underneath both languages stating that will say (TROPHIES) that DOES NOT appear on your game in question. It IS on his AC II greatest hits, AC III, and also his RELEVATIONS. We hope that this has helped you. Remember to look on the back top right of your cover sleeve, that's where they print that sort of info.
The order according to the timeline is: Assassin's Creed Assassin's Creed II Assassin's Creed Brotherhood Assassin's Creed Revelations Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag Assassin's Creed Freedom's Cry (DLC for black flag) Assassin's Creed Rogue Assassin's Creed III Assassin's Creed Liberation And there is a second DLC with Aveline on Black Flag and that comes last. So there you go.. hope this helps
No
It depends on you.I think it's not necessary you have to play AC1 if you only play AC2.But if you play the Ezio trilogy you'd better paly the AC1
no the game is in english
Assassins Creed 1 does not have subtitles.
Why yes it is!
it is in 3rd person.
This came used from a third party seller, so he included everything listed.I think you have to read each listing if used and see what they are including.
You can as long as you have an Xbox Live account.
Who sent this and you can send it back and get your money back and i have one for sale if you want another one
Yes it comes with everything required to use the console
There is no built in wifi with this console. Only the new slims have built in wifi. These units you will either need direct line with ethernet cord or need a wireless adapter for it to work.
Forza horizon crisis 2 the walking dead shadow of mordor battlefield 3 assassins creed rogue saints row 4 brink call of duty ghost call of duty modern warfare assassins creed brotherhood batman Arkham origins halo 4 ghost recon advanced soldier darksiders 2
Please read the seller notes to confirm what is included as each seller may provide a different bundle.
Yes, along with the power box and video cable cord.
Hi Tanya! It will come with the standard Xbox 360 headset, but does not come with an Xbox live code.
It came with the console, one controller, power cord and HDMI cord
I don't have a mac but I think it would. It depends on what you are doing with it, because it might need drivers that are not available for mac.
I bought this for PC use after reading some reviews. It worked on Win7 x64 for a while, but lately I've been getting error codes from it in both Windows and Linux. I finally gave up and am no longer using it, so I would advise avoiding it if you primarily intend to use it for PC. Also, it doesn't have rumble support in Windows.
I assume so because it works all my ps1 and ps2 controllers but I've never tried a dualshock 1
yes ,but I haven't pinpointed the driver you will need.
No, it doesn't. My brother bought one to use for guitar hero and it didn't work.
It will not unfortunately. It does work with dance pads and regular PS2 controllers. If you want a link to one that does work, check my review :)
99% of the time will will work with other pc and or the ps3. I have used it on both for gaming and even used a ps1 controller. also it depends if your using it for a type of game like street fighter vs. say any other type of gaming hardware. It would but not unless the software/ game your playing allows for that type of controller to be used. and if it's not fully compatible for that software it maybe have issues if it doesnt work, you'll have to read on each type of software used before purchase and or etc. Mainly do research before you do.
This power supply is NOT for the elite.
It was for my nephew so
Not that I saw.
I'm not sure, this one works on my old xbox360 which is not the newer slim type.
Not sure, my xbox is from 2009 and i'd just recommend you look at the connections and see if they are similar
No, it appears to be 110v only.
Did not burn out grandson lost all hookups for Xbox so we gave for Christmas present
Thought this was a part for the Xbox a gaming system but it doesn't work at all
I'm assuming that Xbox makes their systems the same so I would say yes
110v
Screwdriver was included.
A few hours
Time to buy another battery
No, that is the battery within the game cartridge, which is a watch battery.
Mine says 850. Works great. Holds charge as well as the original. Hope that helps
Probably, your original battery is ten years old now and has cycled a lot of times.
You don't actually buy a new LCD. You can buy just the little light. Installing it is a monster pain though. There are several tutorials on youtube however.
When I purchased my replacement battery, it came with a yellow screwdriver that fit perfectly.
YES THEY DO, VERY NICE STYLE.
Yup. There's an airplane adapter included.
No.
I use mine for running, biking and cross country skiing with no problems. They fit well under a helmet or watch cap. I live in interior Alaska and have to keep them in a warm place before putting them on as the metal in the frame can give contact frostbite (like a burn blister) if I leave it exposed to outside temps too long and put it straight on. As long as you don't turn the volume up too loud, you should be able to hear cars or other people just fine. It will never be as safe as exercising on the road without them on, but I really enjoy having music or audio books while I exercise.
Yes
YES THEY ARE, WORKS REALLY WELL.
I believe you can get them on the B&O website
I believe it is on a sticker on the brown box they were packaged in. Don't remember for sure as it has been a while since I bought them.
Yes, you can, at least with my iPhone 5, it worked.
I had the same problem, still under warranty, and the company refused to fix them. Do not send them back to B&O (who wanted $50 to fix mine). Go to a local electronics repair shop. I did that and had them fixed for $5.
No, You don"t need Xbox Live to play this. It's really fun to play with a second player.
If you have an Xbox 360 with the Kinect you can play this game but it will not use the motion sensors because it was released prior to the Kinect. This game is played with a controller.
A is jump, X is attack, A+X is a Jump attack, AA+X is a double jump attack, B is to use the force, Y is to change characters, B also builds things that need construction in order to complete a task or level, I may have a few buttons off atm, but if you read the instruction manual it will be very insightful on the controls. You also can break stuff and use the force with B to get coins. The blue coins are worth 2000, gold is worth 100, and silver are worth 10. The more coins you get, the more things you can buy; such as characters or lego model kits (ships and such). Fun if your a star wars fan, great for kids. Hope this helps a little bit.
NO, it's an old game. Kinect didn't show up when it was developed
You can play with two players when using the same xbox. I am not sure about playing with people on xbox live though.
A whole new game
Yes
Because, as a quick google search reveals, it's an xbox360 game released in 2007.
No its only 2 player offline.
No. We play it on a regular TV.

Yes it will work with any wii remote,it also worked with mine
yes, and they work great and are at a great price!
When I ordered it, it was just one battery and no choice of colors for the back.
I just replaced the batteries in my remote and did not have to remove them to fit in charger supplied with my Wii system. They just fit the charger and the back of the covers have contacts that match the charger to the remote without removing the shell nor battery. Charging lites come on and change colors when fully charged.
You'd have to buy a new one
Yes it does. I have 2 wii plus remotes I use with these batteries.
One. And make you speicify what color you want too.
The version for Windows 7 doesn't work properly, it has too many bugs. I also have a netbook that has Windows XP and the version for the XP works fine.
Yes t does I use it all the time and I have Windows 7
no
yes
there are three others , and then you have to choose two of them. You also can play alone
Sorry, Virginia, I do not know the answer to that.
This works with the Xbox Original Controller, however I am not sure about Windows 8 as I use Windows 7 and Mac OS X. This works great under those two operating systems. I do not see why it would not work as long as the driver installs.
No, I've tried it. This cable is for connecting your old xbox controller to a computer where, along with some downloadable software, you can use it to play games.
Yes
yes
To PC, it might.. to Xbox 360 definitely no.
Yes
The adapter will work for any original XBox (released in 2001) controller (regular, mini, dance pad, or Steel Battalion); it does not work with Xbox360 or Xbox One controllers. It is less than 3 ft long.
nope. original xbox only. 360 controllers do not need any adapters to work with windows OS.
About 20 inches
The blue book signifies a recipe book, a cookbook if you will. The number, which is actually 0 (zero) P not OP shows how many recipes you've actually cooked. Once you cook one recipe, the number will go up.
No ship to US only
Go to the beach and fish.
Well, neither the guide nor the game developers really say what the best time is, but I've found that when I go fishing, there tend to be more bites on rainy days at any time, and on sunny days from about 7-9am and 6-10pm. Also, I tend to get the most bites in the river on the farm, just below the chicken coop and nearby the bridge. This may not be true for everyone, it just seems to be the case when I play. Hope this helps!

Yes it can. I installed it on my laptop that currently has windows 8 and I can play both just fine. You may have to try going through the "forces of corruption" three times. I had to start it three times before it would actually work. However, i don't have do it every single time. It was only in the beginning.
I don't know if there's any such support, but since this game is essentially a spaceship RTS and not a flight simulator, I really, really doubt it.
There are a lot of nods for it. So probably.
This game is not about the clone wars....
Yes..I ordered and received the Gold pack
Download again
Yes, I have a Windows 7-64-bit system and it works just fine.
You can also download it off Steam. Steam is a free download. Make a free Steam account, download Steam, and buy the game
No, I think they fit it all on one DVD, if I recall.
I'm not sure if you can. It may be possible but this is a question for STEAM support. STEAM offers the game as well. I would purchase it through STEAM if possible.
Yes you can. With my setup i have the yoke, rudder pedals and two throttle quadrants and it works great!
when you move the levers below the detent at the bottom, they hit buttons, these buttons are programmable, and can be programmed to reverse your thrust. I've been using these for two years and it works great for just that. If you fly a turbo prop, you can have one for fuel cut off, and more.
I can't confirm whether it will work with windows 8, But I can answer your question about the CH stick one. It is its own Joystick with its own USB interface. It operates as a stand-alone device thus you can use any other stand-alone Joystick along with it. Hence, yes. It will be compatible with your CH Product.
Hello, The Pro Flight quadrant (pz45) is a usb connected peripheral that can be used together with the throttle quadrant that comes with our pro flight yoke for multi engine function.
It it's the way they come. Insert the turn screw into the mounting bracket and then press the suction cup onto the end of the turn screw. You need to apply a fair amount of pressure and it will pop into place. It does not come attached since you can attach the throttle to the bracket in one of two places, depending on where you are mounting it.
I'm not quite sure. Try contacting Saitek or view there website to troubleshoot it to see if it may just be a driver issue or a software issue.
I recently purchased a serious computer for my flight simulator which makes use of the SAITEK add on equipment. I could not get Flight Sim X to work with windows 8 and have downgraded my machine to windows 7 and everything works perfectly. My suggestion is to stay away from windows 8 or 8.1 or whatever they launch next. Good Luck
Hi, I cant remember exactly - I seem to think its around 500mm, it has to be close the the USB port. I run all mine to a 12 port powered USB and extend that to the PC
No
Yep. Connects fine via hubs and direct to mainboard
Yes, without any issues
I haven't had the issue at all and I've had it for 2 years. by reading reviews I think it was solved in fall 2008.
This is what I found on the Saitek forum (http://www.saitekforum.com/showthread.php?t=13941). There does seem to be a fix, in essence, do not load the Saitek drivers and let FS recognize the new device and a couple of other recommendation about controls 9, 10 and 11 and about adjust the config file. I am in the same situation (Nov. 2011) as Android and I guess I will go ahead and buy it. Will post the results of the experiment. Regards, Yves.
no, 45 degree rotation
Not sure what exactly you're asking. This comes with the yoke and one 3-lever throttle. The other "instruments" from Saitek (ADI, Heading, Alt) as well as the Saitek Pro Flight Rudder Pedals are sold separately
My yoke doesn't bind. Sensitivity is adjustable within the software. Mechanically speaking, mine works fine.
Yes it will work as it is not the system that will cause it not to work it is the game/program that you might have problems' with.
Yes, xplane 10 has a lot of settings for the yoke.
Hello, The rudder pedals operate different axis so ideally this should work, however since they are both different third party drivers there is a slight possibility that there maybe a conflict.
No problems so far. All features are working perfectly so I'm afraid I can't be much help.
Its a piece of crap that cant support more then 2 controllers
I tested the multitap on the very first version, not the slim.
Well my ps2 system is the regular version so I would not be able to give you a straight answer... But my "guess" is that it should work with the PS2 Slim
Only certain games use this accessory, and different games tell you to connect the controllers differently. Check the manual for the game you want to use it with for details. If you don't have the manual, ask in an online forum either one for video gaming in general, or one specific to that game.
yes, but under the name "rummy squares."
Yes, it does.
The version I have (2007/2008) has the games you ask about plus 24 more, some very good and some not so. Double cross word game is very good, plus the slide tile game is a real favorite. Well worth the money for these games.
Yes it does work.
Yes. I play Hoyle games esp. the card games.
Backgammon battling ships, bump em, checkers, Chinese checkers, chest, dominos, crazy contraptions, tile games, master match, maximum pool, maze racer, maze Raider, parchisi, panic, placer racer, raise, Reversi, rummy squares, rUnes of Avalon, solitaire arcade, star collector, sodoku, time breaker, word games, yacht, and zilch.
yes.
The game wouldn't work on Windows 7mso I returned it.
Go to Hoyle Bucks in the Game Items section, and continue to scroll through the items until you see the items for sale that you can't see beforehand. In other words, the "invisible" items. Click "Buy" or "Purchase" next to each one of these, and you'll have all of your colored dice. I also was interested in using the colored dice, but after trying each of these different colors, I personally decided that the white and cream colored dice were the best looking ones, even though they were the colors already unlocked to use when I first installed the game. The various colors such as red, green, purple, and other ones didn't make the Zilch game any more entertaining to play. By the way, does your "Help and Strategy" section work at all? When I click on that, nothing happens.

sorry, I don't remember; I just played solitaire and I no longer use the Hoyle card games
Yes
You set up your face and you play against only computer partners. For Canasta, it is 4 players, you and a partner and two others. You are the only real person but you can select your preferred computer people to play with. I personally like Harley and Jack and Elaine.
I looked on the back of the CD holder. It says "SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: WINDOWS Vista, XP I'm using it on my Apple laptop OSX. It doesn't say anything about Window 8. Wish I could help more.
I don't know. I have an Apple MacBook Pro and it works fine. Sorry I can't be of more help. It is a nice program when you want to relax and play cards. When you are on the computer it will ask if you have have one or more players. I always have one and I can play fine. Hope you get your answer.
Yes it does.

PlayStation 2 Console Slim - Black; SCPH-90001 CB / 97706 There's no actual "Model" name or number listed on the outside of the box.
Yes, it plays both play station 1-2. Play station 2 needs bigger memory cards..compared to play station 1. It kind of nice, one doesn't have to replace all their play station one games..
Yes ma'am. I had no problem playing any of my couple dozen PS1 games on this version of the PS2. However, you will need PS1 memory cards, not PS2 memory cards, to save your PS1 game.
There is no hard drive, you need to have memory cards for a ps2
Yes
I'm guessing you have this controller and not the console? I would say no because the ps2 has 8 sets of male leads which the factory controller plugs into then you would have to take into account the size of the plug of the controller and the console housing. So if you're gonna get a ps2 it should already come with 1 controller if not just spend the extra & get 1 that will 4 certain work.
I've had my first PS2 for about 8yrs. compaired to my son's PS3 which only lasted for 3yrs.
Yes it can.
Yeah
Just AV jacks.
You mean Guitar Hero 5?
If you play them without the xbox then they won't sound like drums. It'll just sound like sticks hitting a rubber surface. So technically you could, but it wouldn't be anywhere close to a real set. Now if you play them WITH the xbox it will sound more authentic, because depending on which game you use to play it might have an option for Free Style which would allow the user to play the drums like a real set without having to play to a specific song.
No, the Rock Band 2/3 drum set is wireless.
Yes It does ! Mine came with official rock band drumsticks (:
yea but they are not that great.
The picture I see is an Rock Band 1 and the cymbals will not work. The Rock Band I bought my grandson is a Rock Band drum set 2 and battery operated and the cymbals will work on it for the XBOX 360. Hope that was helpful to you!
Yes it is. I have Band Hero, Rockband 1&2, Beatles, and Guitar Hero Metallica, and the set works with all of them.
Yes
yes
I use a way older version of this flight stick and it works although you have to bind each control independently.
No.
There is a PC/PS3 Switch on the left rear of the Thrustmaster. For a list of Backwards Programmable compatible games to PS3 from PS2 and earlier, Wikipedia is one link to check; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PlayStation_3_backward_compatible_PlayStation_2_and_PlayStation_games
So far I'd say it's very durable; the stick is thick and study and the unit is heavy enough so that with my right hand resting on it, (I'm leftie) it does not move; played NHL hockey, flight games, and MW4 (yes it still plays) so far and everything is great - the programmable part is cool, and it is tight and responsive and I would say very accurate. This is a keeper - it's my 2nd I have a very old one from when it first came out, and it works but is a little slower and less buttons. This is near-perfect. The only fault is it is right handed, but manageable with lefties.
Yes
Sorry I don't know. I have it configured for Raise of Flight
yes I use it with windows 8.1
yes indeed ...I have XP
I think you should still be able to download the weekly puzzles.
Comes with the case, at least it did when I bought it
Yes

I have the original G15 and I hope it never breaks since the change was pretty drastic. The color orange is good since when I have a lot of white on my monitor the keys are barely readable since the reflection from the monitor makes my blue keys hard to see. I currently use 14 of the keys, most with shortcuts to programs. I memorize where they are and I have one button access to them. The fewer keys now means that I will now I have to use the M button to toggle and then select. This adds another step, but I guess it's fine since I only use 14 of the 54 keys provided. I rarely use them in-game.
yeah but why does the product description look like it's from the olver version of the g15 kb. Product Description Stay in the game with the Logitech G15 keyboard. The tilt-able, backlit GamePanel display lets you keep tabs on messages, see game status and monitor many types of system information - all while you're still in the game. 18 programmable macro keys give you the ability to easily create up to 54 custom macros per game and the cool blue backlit characters on every keycap help you keep playing until late. It even features a full-speed USB hub and convenient cable routing channels for your mouse and headset!o hitting that button accidentally won't end your game.The Logitech G15 keyboard is completely customizable to help you play better. Try it and you'll never go back to a standard keyboard.
Yes, the keyboard and the software that comes with it is compatible with windows 7 and 8.
It says that it supports Mac OSX..
I have the same problem.
My laptop is a HP; windows 7. Hope this info is helpful. Have a Great Day!
Yes, it works on windows 7!
It is a physical copy
I do not know if it works with Window 8. I have Window 7 on my pc. Sorry. Harold
It will still say Microsoft on it even if it is a PC version. if you did get an Xbox 360 copy then contact them, it won't do anything on your computer.
You have to put the disc in the drive to play. Hope this will help you. Harold
Yes.
don't use mac my os is windows and it works ok on it.
George, The panel works with everything in FSX. I have a 'mixed-bag' hangar full of 200+ freeware and payware craft and all my Saitek panels work with all my planes/boats/vehicles without fail. Actually the panels make a lot of freeware pieces more fun due to a lot of them having a 2D 'pit instead of a VC. Like I put in the review, I liked the first two FIPs I got so much that I had to get two more! You will not be disappointed.
they only certify their fip on msfsx. they do not comment on other sim engine
I really don't know if it's any help to you, but I've got a radio panel, auto pilot panel, switch panel, & a throttle control, all plugged into a 7 usb holder, I do have a spare 7 usb holder, if I need it, the altimeter panel goes straight to my PC. Hope this might be of some help to you. Chas
Not unless you boot camp into windows
Personally they were not what I expected. I bought three of them and right now they are in a drawer collecting dust. I bought them based on the reviews but apparently these people that reviewed them are on their payrool or easily impressed. I found them to be flakey on their readouts, they are very small and the knobs are hard to work with. They do not preform as well as they are advertised either. Forget about tech support. I also found them to be a little too arrogant when it comes to telling them what is wrong with their product, and no help in correcting them. They might be good for a desktop flyer, but they did not live up to my expectations and I would not have bought them if I had not been misled on what programs they can be used for. They do not work with FS2002,FS2003, FS2004, FS9 but again flakey. They do work with FSX. (not the way I would like)Maybe you will have a better use for them than I did. They sure are not worth the money they are asking for them either. Good Luck
Hello! You can download new gauges from the internet (Google "Saitek FIP Gauge,") and/or you can make your own one (you write the XML). There are instructions provided on FSX Times by Tom Tsui, located here: https://fsxtimes.wordpress.com/ . He's also got some free gauges, some paid gauges, instructions, setups, etc. It's a great resource. You are not limited to Saitek's gauges, there are lots of customization options.
I haven't found a GPS gauge for it, it does have a VOR NAV gauge, it does connect via USB, you can download additional gauges but they are not required, and it sort of functions with Windows 8. You have to download .NET Framework 3.5 to interface with it for Windows 8 since the software is built for XP (Saitek, for the love of God, update your software). Once you've downgraded your .NET Framework and made it active, the FIPs will work.
no
Yes
Pro flight instrument is used to show aviation instrument info.. if you want to show a map with gps location you can export out and show on a monitor
Yes.
Yes. If you're not going on line to do multiplayer, no problem. But to play online, you need all the updates and install the oldest in first. I really liked playing Combat Flight Simulator 2 a lot, too. Anyway, Microsoft shutdown their servers so multiplayer's a thing of the past. If you can find #2 get it. Course you need a joy stick. If you want to go online to play a multiplayer combat flight sim, try Aces High or Warbirds. Look them up on Google. Hope this helps.
Google will now answer questions like this by just typing question. The answer came up: To run the Program Compatibility troubleshooter Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the Start button Picture of the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Programs, click Run programs made for previous versions of Windows.
Donald- I finally got CFS3 to work on my Win7-64. I had to go into the control panel to software installation. Run compatibility program.
It doesn't work on windows. 8
It will work with windows 7, 32 bit, 64 bit has some problems and it will work with the extreme 3D joystick -- to some degree -- some of the features of the joystick don't work as they do with MS flight simulator. You can fly with it, engine speed, up, down, right, left so on, but some things such as bomb, rockets are controlled by the keyboard. At least I haven't found where those buttons are?? Don't expect the same results that you can get with regular flight simulator. Good luck.
No, Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 3 is only able to be played on Windows 7/XP.
no you have to have a flight stick
Yes it is, but to be honest I don't think combat flight SIM is that great of a game I would suggest IL2 instead
Yes, it doesn't work on windows 8/8.1 so of course it works with windows 7! :D
No
Technically, no, it will work on it's own, but in such a limited manner you are best off picking up a move controller.
No you don't need a clip and it does not have a tv clip. It can sit on top of the tv or where ever you want to put it.
Yes and yes. Watch this video to see how to install on windows 7 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ujCN5euIhc
I am not familiar with Skype per say but I do know that once you download the driver for this cam it can be used as a standard webcam which I've used as a security camera so I suppose it should work with Skype as well once you download the actual driver from code laboratories should cost you a $1.99 for the driver.... search for code laboratories ps3 cam driver on Google
Ps3
It was very easy found it the eye quick works perfectly
No, connected by USB cable.

Charles, just loaded this game on my Windows 8 computer and have played around six hours with no problems whatsoever. Happy gaming!
Have you verified the requirements are supported by your cpu?
Yes - you can install on Windows 7
Yes. That is what I play it on. No problems except you have to put the Titan disc in to start game every time you play.
Yes, it has several languages, including Spanish
Multiplayer feature allows for 2-6 players to play on the same server. This uses a centralized pairing system run by Gamespy
I do not believe that internet or phone registration is required. The registration key is included in the package.
If this is the Metal Gear Solid 4 ps3 40Gb bundle, then Yes, Otherwise No. The only 3 PS3 systems that are Backwards Compatible are the Fat 20Gb ps3, the Fat 60gb Ps3 (best recommended console), and the Fat 80gb ps3 (doesn't play certain ps2 disc-based games)
You can play all PS3 game discs, most PSOne discs, and digital games downloaded from the PSN. You CANNOT play PS2 discs in this model. However, some PS2 games have been remastered and are available as downloads for the PS3 thorough the PSN.
One.
we have played nba14 on yours so i dont see why not
mine didn't. I bought mine used. it had some issues but over all it's a good system. if it doesn't have one already, then you'll need to buy an hdmi cord for Blu-ray discs, and to enhance video game graphics. I suggest buy a relatively cheep cord here on amazon.
don't see why not
Yes standard online service is free but you have to pay for sonys storage for copy protected saves...i dont think it costs to play games online or anything? Just setup a PSN account & your good to go i think?
Yes
your question is not clear, please rephrase your question so I can help you.
Mine didn't work had to send back sorry
In the hypothetical situation where one does download and play an emulated game, it works very well with not only the controller layout being similar to commonly emulated systems (SNES, N64), but also is very responsive. I use a regular PS2 controller myself and in my 'hypothetical situation pod' I see myself playing and enjoying emulated games that I have never personally downloaded in reality.
Yes
It will likely make them be axes. I purchased one to convert my yamaha ms1 handlebars to PC. It worked great for that.
Firstly, what operating system are you using? Compatibility issues might be your problem; I can't seem to find what OSes this device is compatible with on the listing. I use mine with an old Windows XP computer and it recognizes fine. Secondly, maybe your converter is broken. Try it on different computers and see if you get a different response. If it doesn't recognize on any computer, there's a chance you might've received a dud. I'd ask for a refund/exchange. Hope you get it working. I didn't have any issues with mine.
Yes
Yes.
Yes it uses the universal HID codec for usb. Works on my iMac should work on your macbook pro
if you can hook up any ps2 or 1 controller in it, it should work.
Yes. It does. I use it daily.
No
If you're going to purchase it from Steam, then obviousy yes. If you purchase it from Amazon, no. I purchased the download version of MTW II . No Steam required, even in disk format.
Yes. Perfectly fine.
Yes
No
no you don't unfortunately but once you learn the game and play long enough you'll learn the map. I've been playing since the medieval total series came out and own all the games along with their expansions, so feel free to ask any other questions ok bye jungo467
I don't know
Not within the game itself.
CPU: Pentium 4/Athlon XP CPU Speed: 2.4 GHz RAM: 1 GB OS: English version of Microsoft Windows 2000/XP. Video Card: 100% compatible DirectX 9.0c 256 MB Hardware Accelerated video card with Shader 2 support and the latest drivers (NVIDIA GeForce 6800+ DirectX version: 9.0c Sound Card: Yes Free Disk Space: 11.0 Gigs of uncompressed free hard disk space DVD-ROM: 8x Speed DVD-ROM drive (1200KB/sec sustained transfer rate) and latest drivers
Yes, it contains Medival 2 total war, and the 4 dlc packs.
yes runs fine on windows 7, I'm on 7 home premium, using a 64 bit system, and it runs great with no problems
No
Although this program can be run on a Mac in a Windows emulator, a better solution is to get Optimum Video Poker (OpVP) which will run native on any Mac OS X 10.2 or later, including Yosemite. Of course it will also run on any Windows 2000 or later, including Windows 8. OpVP is also a true trainer by displaying the strategy chart of your choice next to the game window and highlighting your errors in the chart.
CD has Jacks or Better, Bonus Poker, Double Bonus Poker , Double Double Bonus Poker , Triple Bonus Poker and maybe two others. I can't remember all. But a very good CD with tutorial etc.
I got it for my wife for a practice format because she plays the video poker machines in Reno quite a bit. It appears that there's about 2 dozen games on it.
it has not worked for me on 8.1.
Yes, this game most definitely does play in Windows 7.
Not sure. Perhaps the game's official website might have some information.
On Windows 7: yes.
As this is a computer game, there is no need to hook this up to your TV. Now if you have a screen no bigger than a watch face then I'd say if your able to hook that up to your TV then most definitely do it. I run this on my laptop and it's just fine. Enjoy!
yes
Physical, but you still have to set up a Blizzard online account to play it. However, it makes a good flying projectile to ward off the zerg... Maybe the line between reality and fantasy is beginning to blur in my old age...
Yes it does I have it on 8.1 and it runs just fine.
Yes this is the entry to the storyline of SC2. Wings of liberty is the first of 3, Heart of swarm will be the next one you'll want and coming out in a year I believe will be Legacy of the void very good games
If someone already used the product key, you will still need to purchase a product key, so it would be like buying the game all over again. I wouldn't suggest buying it used, because you can download the starter edition for free and then just buy a product key from blizzard.
Yes sir, it sure does. As long as your system setting are beyond that of the requirements you can play this on your Mac. Check out the details here if you're interested: https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/starcraft-ii-system-requirements
Until you put in your code, it will be starter edition. Visit battle.net, log in with your account, and then redeem a code for Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty. The code comes in the box, and you probably have to scratch it off or something similar, I can't remember.
The game does require a broadband internet connection. Offline mode is available only in those circumstances where you temporaily lose a connection in which you may continue to play for that session only. Even then you have to login as a "guest" even though you own the game. Guest privileges only last 30 days before you have to login to a live internet connection to re-register the game. Otherwise, you are locked out of your own game. Kinda sucks doesn't it?
It does have a story mode.
It's not a hacked copy and yes you will be able to play multi-player and solo campaigns.
You should be able to install it on as many computers as you want... there is no license limit on it like OS software.
No and I highly recommend this game to improve your poker game! Can play more hands per hour than even online poker sites if you choose to skip all the AI reaction time or skip to next hand once you fold.
Richard H., the answer is yes, Master Poker does run on Windows 8. Windows 8 considers all software that worked on previous versions of Windows to be 'legacy' software. Win8 comes with a new desktop look, but still allows you to switch to the old familiar legacy Desktop, where it will run many legacy software programs. It will not run all older software written in every programming language, but it will run all software written in one of Microsoft's programming languages, which Master Poker, fortunately, is. Hope this answers your question. / SS
Yes...I use Win 7 64 bit and it works great
I am using the 64-bit version of Windows 7 Professional Edition Service Pack 1 and have no problems with Master Poker. If you are running the Home Edition you will probably be OK but I would definitely recommend an upgrade to the Professional Edition.
A note from the developer: There is no place in Master Poker where you must input the type or version of your Windows operating system. The address for tech support is all over your receipt and on the back of your CD. You can also write me directly through Amazon. Help is always here if you seek it in the right place, but I can't help if you don't contact me directly.
Mine says V2.0.1
Funny, Everybody is new at poker... This CD is by far the best tutorial ever.Best money I spent in a long time.Hours upon hours of fun.
Not that I am aware.
Not sure.When I bought the product there was an Email address from the developer. Hope this helps.
No Internet connection of any kind is required.
Yes it does. I just use it in PS3, but after your question I tried in my Galaxy S5 and it worked well
7-15days
Unfortunetly it wont because xbox 360 doesnt support bluetooth and its a bluetooth headset so theres no way to connect it hope this helped.
I have a ps3 but yes it's very good
Most likely if you computer has Bluetooth.
I think so, I have PS3 and 4, but I think it works on every Bluetooth connection.
Don't buy
It didn't even work with my PS3. Save your money and listen to the reviews on here. The official Sony bluetooth headset works much better and for only $15 more.
Yes
Sorri, I haver no idea. But if PS Vita had a bluetooth connection i think it might work.
dont know but they have a web site http://www.matrixgames.com/products/319/details/John.Tiller's.Battleground.Civil.War
The instructions say it runs on XP, Vista and Windows 7. It runs fine on Vista.
Should work with XP but I don't know about windows 8.
Yes, the color of the Xbox doesn't matter. My Xbox is a Ryse (Black) and this cord still works just perfectly on it.
It's a little over 3 feet. I was disappointed since the last one I had was longer.
No they are not they are cheap knock offs spend a couple more dollars and get the real deal unless you want a 3 foot cable that is the cheapest quality
yes it will work without it
Probably not
Yes you can use it on a Mac. You'll have to download and install a driver for it to work though. Just google "xbox 360 controllers driver for mac" and pick one of the top links. I was able to make the controller work with Steam (specifically Portal 2).
It doesn't work on pc
This isn't really a question
Yes, that is what is on my computer. So, it definitely works. :)
Yes it does.
To me it does not even matter because the complete collection has way more animals you can control and build exhibits for. It's unlimit amounts of fun in my opinion!
Yes it is.
I'm in the same dillema. Unfortunately there is no digital version replicated yet. They do have external cd/DVD rom drives that you can plug into your laptop (in the USB port) and play it that way. Search external cd drive in amazon
No
Yea it actually does and this game is really good if your a animal person. You can build almost any exhibit for any animal you want. There's about a good 90 animals but I wish they would have included more in the game.
Yes.
Yep, I had it on vista back when vista was the newest os
Nothing Truly, all that changes is the box color, and the fact that certain collectors prefer the original case over the greatest hits due to it's increase in popularity.
Yes
No
Hola , si el juego trae sub-titutos al espao, bueno el que me enviaron si
To be honest I've never had this problem but my best advice would be to either contact EA or I know on YouTube they have serial codes for the base game and expansions so you could also try that but there's no guarantee that could work, worse case scenario is you return the game and purchase a new copy. Hope I cou help. ~Hannah
Yes. My daughter has windows 7 and it works fine.
Hi, thanks for asking. The factory code is printed on the back of the manual. there is only one install code. Aaron
It does not work well on Windows 8.
Yes, I have it installed and running on a Windows 7 Pro 64bit PC
Yes it is.
Yes.. I have a family i made and i made the mom n dad woohoo or try for a baby and u will here a baby noise or somethin.. Then as u play she throws up n stuff n belly get big and then have the baby
Yes. I have run all expansion packs on an old Compaq with 2GB Memory and it did OK; we are currently running on a Dell laptop with 3GB Memory and it does just fine. I would not expect you to have any trouble.
Mari, I don't know. I run the game on Windows 7. I did have to bypass the Launcher to play the game. A Google search does reveal issues with running Sim2 on Windows 8 (and possibly 8.1) that date back to 2013. I did ultimately find a link to the "Mod The Sims" website (http://modthesims.info/t/500523) where they describe a process of doing a clean reinstall of the game and setting each installed expansion pack to run in Compatbility Mode for Windows XP, Service Pack 2 (not Service Pack 3), see the link for details if interested. Launcher bypass method here: http://answers.ea.com/t5/The-Sims-2/Sims-2-Double-Deluxe-Launcher-Crash/td-p/2005641 Regards, Paul
The game was released 10 years ago, its no longer available in that format.
No it doesn't come with a charger. It is only the controller.
Ill put it back and Ill sent to amazon. I know that Amazon will give me another one that works correctly.
I believe so. That's what my husband did with his
There may be imposters on the market. I would look for quality markings of the logo and features (dualshock 3, sixaxis, PS button) and the manufacturers sticker on the back, it's almost part of the controller and won't come off. Also check for weight, it has the mechanism inside for realism effects.
The wireless controllers (at least the ones I've had) don't take batteries. You plug it directly into the console to charge it. The system has to be turned on for the charge to work, but after keeping the controller plugged in for 6 hours or so (for a new controller), you can unplug it again and probably go 20 or more hours before you have to charge again. The red power light on the controller starts to blink when the battery is getting low and all you have to do is plug it in again for a while.
It is the CECHZC2U.
No, it did not come with blue tooth dongle.
Yeah the black one is the controller you get with the console. The controllers are all the same no matter what the color is.
Yes you can.
The one I received is definitely a fake. Sold by Purchases Direct through Amazon. Playing any type of shooter game is near impossible to get right as the joysticks sensitivity is so far off. There is no fine movement with sticks. The controller I got looks just like the real thing at a glance. Once I put it in my hand and tried playing a game I instantly new something was wrong. Look up real vs fake dualshock 3 and you will find a lot of videos and pictures showing what to look for.
You cannot. It is a hard plastic case. If you need to have a shifter on the left, look into the Logitech G25 or G27 :)
yes you can a real nice wheel i had mine for 5 yrs now
From everything I have been reading on GTP, this won't work on the PS4 unless Sony updates it so it can be used. If you are buying this for the PS4, expect it to not work. Yes it is USB and Plug and [lay and all that stuff. But If Sony has it blocked out, It will never work.
Yes I am. I love it and use it daily. This wheel takes PC racing to a whole different level. I use it mostly on iRacing and have had good success with league racing. This unit doesn't have a clutch pedal but this feature can be set-up as "auto clutch" on almost all racing software.
They aren't big paddles but there are buttons on the back of the wheel that are used to shift.
Yes As far as I know but if you can make more resurch
My grandson used it fine on GTA
Ordinarily that is done within whichever game is being played. (Perhaps I didn't understand the question)
Yes
The instruction manual was not in the box when I received it. but my box was heavily damaged from shipping. I understand that can happen so it may be for you. if you decide to buy it feel free to ask me anything and I can help you set it up. it's very simple and I"ll be glad to help in any way I can.
Yes, I've used on my iMac. I have quite an old OS (Snow Leopard... the best version of Mac OS), but I don't see why it shouldn't work on newer versions.
If you get crown buttons from ettoki you don't have to modify the holes. You can use a sanwa joystick, but most mayflash units require you to cut the sanwa pcb (it's ok you direct solder the switches). Also, you have to either Dremel the joystick screw holes or buy smaller screws. Ettoki is awesome, he sells everything, smaller joystick screws, wiring harnesses, joystick, and buttons (crown and sanwa). I ended up only using the mayflash chip and threw it into a tek innovations custom acrylic case since my mayflash stick started peeling and the case itself was a little small and my hand fell over the side if I went crazy on the stick.
Yes it will. you may need to use the tab menu to map the inputs to the stick, but it will work. Here are details on tab setup. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4dNttZbCHE&list=PL0CABFEF11F175A7A
Yes works out of the box. Installation cd is included, but I didn't need it. PC recognized it right away.
There's no spinner. For spinning in Ikari, I configured 2 buttons, one for spinning clockwise and the other one for counter-clockwise...
Yes.
Yes, I have on both. Works fine!
With the PS3 component just being a lazy solder of a controller board, chances are it won't. PS4 dropped compatibility with the PS3 USB and controller. http://www.ign.com/wikis/playstation-4/PS4_Compatible_PS3_Devices If you want my advice, spring for a new controller or better stick. After about 8 months of use this thing finally broke down.
It comes with a USB Plug and a PS2 Plug.
Only with a controller adapter bro
Yes, you sure can it just won't be linked to the online store, or online friends
Quite possibly the buyer wants to know if it says "Go Social" on the top of the box. If it does, it requires Origin and you cannot use Create-A-World's "In-Game" edit with it. Many Sims 3 creators are seeking the original DVD box before the "Go Social" version was released.
It appears that it will but I am running a Mac Maybe you can search around on Google... Top result was:Windows 8.1 compatibility for The Sims 3 version 1 http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Type=Software&Name=The+Sims+3&ModelOrVersion=1&Vendor=EA&Locale=1033&LastSearchTerm=&BreadcrumbPath=The+Sims+3&TempOsid=Windows+8.1
Yes. If it doesn't, you can always use the Windows Backwards Compatibility feature.
Yes it will. I have windows 8.1 and the game runs fine.
Yes it does
Yes this is the actual game, if you buy an expansion pack you need to make sure that this is installed first :) hope this helps
Yes
The size of a standard CD case
The sims 3 I recieced did not work It never load on any of my equipment I had. Sorry I can not answere your question
Not in actuality, no. Ping is a measurement of how fast data travels along the internet pathways to the server and back. This data is transmitted in the form of electricity, which is traveling at very fast speeds. An average internet connection spans hundreds of miles between the server location and the user, and typically only sees ping around 40 milliseconds (1/1000th of a second). The additional 50 feet of this cable produces no measurable effect on you internet ping and speeds, especially in relation to the scale of things.
Not sure what you mean by clips? If you mean to plug into the box or the PC then the answer is NO. It can plug right into the box and PC nothing else needed.
Yes
This cable works well, I have two of them. The signals are digital, so the quality of the cable does not matter much. The sheathing is a little thin and loose so it doesn't feel very durable, but I have not had any problems.
I think they are just trying to show you what's inside. Mine arrived in perfect condition--no tears, no problems,
Do you mean "Is the router within 30 feet away?"
Yes it is true that hooking up your Xbox to your router with a cord is better and faster the wireless. I have my router right next to my Xbox one and xbox 360. I have tried it wireless and the connection drops alot more. And the beautiful thing is if you have a problem, most of the time just unplugging the ethernet cable and plugging it back in fixes it. Also reseting your router orunplugging it and plugging it back in helps as well. The choice is always corded even for controllers that on mila second makes all the difference.
It works on my PC and Xbox 360 and on my tv box so I don't see y wouldn't work on ur ps3
Yes
I use it to connect my computer to the router. As long as your smart TV accepts ethernet cords you're good to go.
Yes it will!
No way Jose
No
This is not compatible with Guitar Hero on the wii. Only the xbox and playstation versions are cross compatible.
I know for a fact that drum set works with ac/dc live. I'm not sure about the Beatles because they came out with a different drum set but the first drum set does work on Rock Band 2 so I don't see why it wouldn't work for the Beatles. I see the drum sets aren't reverse compatible the other way.
No it's not. It has a long cable that plugs into the USB port of the Wii
no this isn't wireless
I bought this quite a few years back, but I don't think so.
Yes it does...
You get the key and Battle net setup. You will still have to download the game
No you don't need the disc because you have to create an account with your key and you always have to be online.
Yes
You can play multiplayer online with two computers, but not two people on one computer.
definitely YES
that's more than enough. at most the game uses 30KB down/up.
Yes, it's compatible with OS X. I can run it on my Macbook PRO.
Both D3 and ROS can only be played online; even in story mode.
It works on Windows 7... so I'm guessing it probably works on Windows 8.1.
I guess that depends on how you purchase it. I bought a boxed game. The key was inside the box... So obviously I had to wait. If you buy as a download, I would think key was available pretty much instantly, or at least at email speed. Me, I am old school. Games should come in a box with nice graphics, not in a "cloud" some where.
in addition (just remembered) Sherlock Holmes would be a good choice for the 10yr old...those were pretty mild. I played one of Agatha Christies games and thought it was pretty pg...only a couple parts where there is a storm outside that feels spooky like halloween a little....
I had XP when I bought these games. But I just checked on BigFishGames which is where I bought them and it does list Windows7 as one of the Operating Systems. Many of these older games do not. I don't think you'll have any problem playing on 7 but I have had several games recently that are "compatible" with 7 that will occasionally freeze up.
only in english
Hi Laura, I have not tried to run Syberia on Windows 8 but . . . Supposedly, going to Windows 8 from 7 does not enjoy the radical compatibility issues as going to 7 from XP. Here is one article that claims few issues will exist in the transition: http://news.softpedia.com/news/Windows-8-Compatible-with-Windows-7-Hardware-and-Software-211576.shtml Here is a good article that discussed various scenarios: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-run-old-games-software-in-windows-8/ Here is an excellent tutorial discussing Windows 8 compatibility mode use. http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/6832-compatibility-mode-use-windows-8-a.html Here is a link to a Big Fish post that suggests that their version will not run. http://forums.bigfishgames.com/posts/list/239885.page Here is a link to Microids (Microids is the original producer of Syberia) forum that talks about the game running slowly. I did not do a thorough search of the forum to see if other posts about Windows 8 compatibility exist. My best Guess: the Microids version will probably run OK; some adjusting of the game's properties through its or gfx options may be necessary. I do not know if the Big Fish version is altered from the original; that could introduce issues. Pardon my bias but I am wildly enthusiastic about this game, which I find to be challenging and just plain fun. To solve compatibility issues, I dual-boot XP/Windows 7 so I can keep running XP or earlier games that are not compatible with Windows 7. One is able to dual-boot Windows 7 and 8 - which is a viable option for you; a web search will give you many good tutorials on how to go about it. Post back if you have any questions. If it were me (it's not) I would buy grab the Microids version (you can query Amazon merchants to see what version they are selling) at least knowing that one person was able to run it on 8, albeit with some issues (that I suspect are related to his specific setup). Regardless, it, to me is worth the gamble. Ed
no its the orginal version.
Together with the Myst series, this is my all-time favorite game. I have played this game on XP, Vista and then I downloaded the game on windows 7 and it worked great. I don't have a win 8, however I believe Microsoft uses similar technology to allow backward program compatibility. If you like this genre, try Tunguska.
Nintendo just announced an official adapter today! Release date pending... http://kotaku.com/nintendo-made-a-gamecube-controller-adapter-for-wii-u-1583342868
You should be fine with UJC mart Japan. Make sure you check out not the item reviews, but the company itself. In general Japan won't be giving out counterfeits, however China and Korea are a bit more risky to order from. Hope this helps.
It's about 8 feet
Yes
No.
Yes it does, the only thing you'd need is the Controller Adapter for the Wii U for it to work.
Yes
It works on US wiis and gamecubes yes. They're not region locked.
The cord is 10 feet long
Glossy like original. I've got all three plugged in to my Wii U, and just compared them. It is pretty hard to tell the difference, but finish on this controller looks/feels most like the original game cube controller.
Yes, we have the Wii u. I think you can use Wii games on the Wii U but not the other way around.
I've only just used the rechargable remotes that came with my Wii package. I did have to buy a new CD as we wore out our original game CD
I Don't think you can use it on the wiiu. I think it's for the original wii only?
Yes. Works we'll.
yes
Yes - that's what I bought it for.
YES
I don't know the answer to that question.
The Controls that come with the game console (Wii Remote Plus Controller. At the bottom of the controller the words: " Wii Motion Plus INSIDE."

yes
doesn't seem to
Yes it is. That's what I have on my laptop, and it runs perfectly fine.
Yes, you do need to have the disk inserted to play. That's really the only bad part about the game, in my opinion.
Yes
You cannot simply put a PS3 or PS2 game in your PS4 and play it. The systems are fundamentally not compatible with each other. Read more at http://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/ps4-backwards-compatibility-can-you-play-ps3-games-on-ps4#zEYKeyDsJPIXz1Hc.99
It's a 3d one.
No
unfortunately i do not have a definitive answer, what i could suggest is you tinker with your closed caption/language settings on your tv set to see if this will assist you.
No the game is in English
No it does not. I have never used an online pass for it and it plays just fine.
The point of the boxed copy is to save having to download the files from steam, other than that the online install of the boxed copy appears to be indentical to the Steam download version. I bought the boxed copy for my brother as he has a monthly bandwidth quota and a 4GB download would bite a chunk out of that. Myself I downloaded the whole thing from steam which took about 2 hours with a 6Mbit connection. We both play online on the same servers and both have to sign in to Steam to play online.
Yes, it works perfectly on Windows 7...even x64.
I can confirm that this item is the full & complete version .. Great deal for $20!
Worked on my windows for like a week then stopped doesn't work now
Yes ot dose work with windows 7 .. Just small recommendation also try company of heroes 2 amazing game
The game auto downloads to the stam interface, there are probably other buying options that aren't connected to steam though.
First Class Mail 3 days, but you can choose to expedite to USPS Priority 2 Day with tracking and insurance.
yes, it's a disc & it requires Steam.
You should be able to find it on the products page in your previous orders on amazon.
Yes, I've played it on my previous laptop which is a Windows 7.
In the normal set up, the entire game is downloaded to your computer. You don't need the disk after the original download to play the game, just click the desktop shortcut icon.
I dont know, it required steam to even boot up.
I wouldn't see why not. It was made when xp was still serviced by Microsoft. I'd should work find.
John,i own a plain old PS2& the HDE PS PS2 USB Dual Controller doesn't work with it.. So ,my answer would be I don't think so
No
Yes it does. Im using windows 8 and it works perfect but i had to download scp-ds3 package driver for it to work with emulators
Yes, it works on win 8 64 bit, and win 7 64 bit.
I don't think it will. The device was designed for PC's in general. If your XBox360 is hacked in some way, it probably could be used to play PS1 games...though honestly most emulators don't support force feedback for DualShock controllers. It does vibrate quite well when the drivers are installed and when you are playing a PC game that supports force feedback.
I'm not certain, but I don't see why that wouldn't work. I'd be very surprised if it didn't. Edit: Okay, I looked into this for you, and now I don't think it will. Apparently, PS1 multitaps do not work when used on a PS2. Since this device is for connecting PS2 controllers, chances are it wouldn't work. I bet a PS2 multitap would work just fine, though.
It works great with wired gamepads on my USB 2.0 systems.
Yes, works with win7, I haven't tested it with win8. But i would think it works fine. Its plug and play.
I tried it on my ps2 (fat)and it does not work so i doubt itll work for the slimon the other hand thank you i,you gave me a reason to whip that bad boy out
Yeah, I've 8.1 and it works.
If I remember correctly, it needs an update before it will work - check Google for a better answer.
Yes, they are the same thing. If not it would update for free to be the same, but if I remember right, when I bought it it was all up to date. It's totally worth the buy imo
Yes it will l. I'm running the game a PC with an AMD phenom x3 2.8 processor and a Radeon HD 6450 video card with max settings. Runs great.
You're gpu would be the main facter in performence, but you should be fine. I run Windows 8 and there are no problems for me
Even if you are administrator, try right clicking on the game and choosing "run as administrator". You may also have to run it in a compatibility mode for Windows 8. I have Windows 7, so I'm not sure:/
I don't believe so, as it was only released on PC. The controls are super funky, so I'm not sure how it could be mapped to a 360 controller...
Yes. I ran it on Windows 7 with no problems.
You get a full sized map of The Northern Kingdoms, a 2 page installation guide, a 48 page insert from The Witcher novel by Andrzej Sapkowski, a 112 page strategy guide, a physical soundtrack on CD and another CD with music inspired by the game, the actual game disc, a bonus disc, and a behind the scenes disc. You'll need to download the Director's Cut patch once you install the game to get all the censored content they cut out of this version.
Yes, I think it will
Yes. But be sure your computer has the proper Windows. It will not operate on my windows 7.
No lag at all that we can tell, I'm a gamer with consoles and computers. My son is Autistic and wants everything fast paced so if there is even a suggestion of an issue we'd have problems. Smash Bros is fast and on going, I'd say no issues at all. Hope this helps.
6ft
Yes! You can combine all four if your heart desires! Just make sure they're secured together tightly so that they don't fall out, and play gamecube from where ever you want.
We bought the Smash Brother bundle that included the adapter for the Wii U and it works great! Don't see a difference that adapter or just playing straight from the Gamecube. The cables work well with Gamecube controllers And the new Smash controller.
No
It is the cost for the four pack. Got them and they work great.
Most Wii's have Gamecube ports on top, under a plastic door. Only the last 2 editions, the Mini and the Family edition(the one designed to lay flat) don't have them. Google for photos of theses two if needed...
There is a hinged cover on the top when the wii is in the stand.
Yes
The CD codes are to insure that you are the actual purchaser of the program and not someone who got the program through some other means, ie an illegal back market copy.
yes it dose work on windows 7
Yes it does.
Yes
No it won't; you would have to buy the Steam version. I bought the DVD version on purpose though just so I wouldn't be dependent on Steam (I do that with any game that is actually available on actual media).
Yes, actualy the logo on the game disk is the Windows vista logo.
You should be able to just add game in steam
Yes.
The Game is up to date
Did you buy a physical "DVD" game or did you by a download game? I have the physical DVD game and I do not need to use the disc (after initial installation) to play the game. I purchased it this way intentionally because some of the online downloaded games have to be run through an online server like Steam and there fore can only be played while you are on line (WIFI connected) and I use my laptop while traveling and seldom have a WIFI connection. Since you don't have an internal DVD player your options would be to buy an external USB player (they can be very inexpensive, from 19.99 up) to download a physical DVD of the game or buy an on line downloadable version.
Yes works well
There is no code. You literally just pop the disc in and install. However, any saves made with the steam version are compatible. I played the steam demo of torchlight, and then deleted the demo. The installer found the remaining nested directory within the steam folder and installed it there, allowing me to pick up where my character originally left off. Personally, I prefer a steam-free experience when possible. You can always add a link to this version through the add feature in steam client. However, you cannot add this version to your steam account.
Torchlight Mac SB for mac specific version and Torchlight JV Hybrid for a hybrid version
Bud, it can't ALL be filtered, near-colorless pallets of gore and grime. Cheer up, I'm sure there'll be more of the same old kind of hack-slash soon that you personally prefer. Not every game is made to please every person, move along, apparently there's nothing here for you--there might be for someone else though.
I don't know if it is. I have windows 7 which it works wonderful. You could look at the specs on the back of the game on the amazon web site to see for sure.
All games have the platforms they are designed for plainly visible on their covers. Some might say Mac and PC some just PC. X-box and other console systems have their own unique platforms and manufacturers will specify those that will play another's platform in their instructions. The Torchlight game I purchased and is pictured here is for PC only.
if you got a 360 you could probably see if they got a version through through xbox live and download it.
They are stereo headphones. Your sound card probably has something that simulates surround. Mine does. Very good headphones.
I just received this headset without the usb sound card adapter, so guessing this listing does not include it.
I didn't know there was a color difference. I purchased the ones pictured and they are awesome
If you're using the USB, yes. If you're using the headphone jack on your computer for them, no.
For flat and accurate sound it's up with the best. It's not the most ideal for bassy music but it will hit all the notes. The Xonar is good, these are only 32 ohm and can be powered by most sources.
The DT 880 doesn't have a mic, so if you have a decent external one, you should be covered. But personally I always prefer a full set. Their prices are almost the same, so I think you should go with gaming, IF you will use it as gaming headset.
You can always set that option through playback devices in Windows. Just right click on the mic device in playback and choose listen to.
No and no. These headphones only have standard audio jack connectors (3.5mm plug with a 1/4" adapter). All the "smarts", if any, will come from whatever this is plugged in to.
I've owned about 5 headsets in the last 2 years. This has been the best headset I've found on the market when it comes to sound and mic quality. It does lack features like mic mute when boom is up and on can volume controls.
These will work with anything that outputs through a standard headphone jack. That being said, these headphones sound best when used with a decent amplifier. Using just a headphone jack will allow for sound in your ears but the mic will require a dedicated mic jack in addition to the headphone jack to use the microphone.
It works well with my Windows 7. My kids love to play it, and haven't had any problems with it so far.
Yes I have Windows 8 also it works fine
Yes
Our grandkids usually play it on a computer NOT connected to the Internet and it works just fine. However, having Internet access is helpful for upgrades.
They are in one bundle (2 discs if I am not mistaken).
Yeah it works great on windows 8
Disc
All 3 it is the full collection! There are so many options you won't know where to start!
No
We had a Dell and HP at the time. It should say it in the system requirements, etc. that they give. I don't like too many computer games but this one had lots of positive aspects and our boys really enjoyed.
Most of them are Jasper mb, just a few you will find a Falcon motherboard. A tip is look for the manufacture date, after dec-2008 every single on I saw was Jasper
Yes. It's hdmi compatible
yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
No, it haven't. You need to buy the wifi dongle for it.
No it does not
No steam required.
Don't know exactly what 64 bit is, but mine played on windows 7 & 8
yeah, that's the multiple player version
Yes
i googled that question and there is a site that says it can be done with linux that reads as follows: There is a lot of good information to installing and configuring CoD4: Modern Warfare here on WineHQ: Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Most of the Tests are Platinum, so it should install and run just fine. It seems versions 1.4 thru 1.6 are the Platinum but version 1.7 may have some problems.
NO AND NO
I don't know why it wouldn't. I played it on a Win7 machine, and it was made for machines older than Vista. Either way, you should be ok, as long as your video card meets or exceeds the recommended requirements.
YES
Didn't know it existed until you asked, but did a Google search. It's available as a download and you can play on stream and others. Check this out on how to get it free: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlQn434c0Xo
Yes! I have it running on Win7 myself.
What do you mean by this "Hello, The model is CECHE01. This thing only lasted 3 months after I got it. Thanks"
This tells it all! https://support.us.playstation.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/232
Yes, that is correct.
It came with one controller and one power cord. That was all. Unfortunately for me, the optical drive didn't work, so I had to return it.
No just the console
1
This console is not backwards compatible, in fact the only PS3 that ever was, was one of the first units made, a 60Gig unit. It was only backwards compatible compatible with PS2. I had one of those for years, it finally died when a visiting dog decided to urinate on it! All PS3s have build in wifi and hdmi output.
I've had mine since 2008 and it still works fine.
No
No
Yes, the version i played is
The two detach, and the throttle can still be used, but I don't think the connective wire is long enough to span between two arms of a chair. Maybe a foot, foot and a half tops.
Yes, it works, but last I tested it was mapped a little strangely by default.
Works great and I love it. For those that are wishing for more hat switches you can use the three thumb buttons on the throttle as modifiers (similar to shift, ctrl or alt) to the main stick buttons in controller setup. This multiplies the buttons on the main stick: You essentially have 4 hats, 4 triggers, and 4x2 thumb buttons on the main stick. I just assign each throttle button to a ship function- like #1 = defensive countermeasures, #2 = navigating/docking operations, #3 = utility (i.e. deploy cargo scoop, silent running, etc.) and I have more than enough capability with this setup. Another nice feature that compliments the game is the middle detent in the throttle that allows you to easily locate zero-throttle versus reverse throttle. Highly recommend for Elite:Dangerous.
From using a tape measure, I came up with 102 inches or 8 ft. 5 inches.
In short, yes. Long answer: There are two options for yaw control. The stick has twist functionality for yaw. For a second option, there is a two way rocker/lever bar behind the throttle assembly (where the tips of your fingers rest).
I cannot say if it works on all of them but every game I have used it on for both mac and pc it worked great.
It works for both of them great! Fully compatible!
Yes it does, but only on the 1998 one. I have only played around with it for 30 minutes or so, but out-of-the-box, the joystick can control the trigger, select object in reticule, select nearest starfighter. The throttle sets the speed but not on a gradient; it's full on, 2/3, 1/3, and 0. There are buttons that set each of these too. I don't think there was anything else. The 1993 game has fewer working controls: just steer, fire, roll, and select object in reticule. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a way to customize the calibration.
It does, indeed. I got it for my PC that runs Windows 8.1, and it works great!
Yes and yes. The Joystick twists AND the throttle has a rocker bar (you can't see in this photo) for rudder control on the back. Both snap back to default when not actually twisting/rocking.

I honestly wouldnt recommend buying, made no difference in my opinion
Yeah, the less heat the better for the system. Having the fan boosts the chances of extending your PS3's life by at least 3 years depending on how often you use it.
I have the 40 and it fits
It is not loud .. but it did not prevent my PS3 from overheating .. it might work for you ..
Not sure about fat boy but mine seems to work good
It covers the back of the PS3 completely and is flush with the system. Doesn't really work though as it actually caused my PS3 to overheat faster.
FSX Gold includes 1. FSX Deluxe + SP1 & SP2 2. FSX Acceleration Pack 3. If interested in SDK the last disk also includes the SDK service packs (2). You do not need the gold version to run on win 7 or win 8! It is only a packed version of everything + service packs. This FSX is the same as when it first came out, it has NOT been updated! Note: you cannot run acceleration with the standard version of FSX
Yes
Yes this will run perfectly well on a Windows 7 32-bit system.
it should. The game worked pretty well on my windows 8.
Yes of course you could there is a full tutorial all the way up an airline pilot. To get the best out of the sim take time to read the 'how to ' e.g. GPS and auto pilot etc. it's well worth it.
I like it and it makes me think I could fly a big plane if necessary. Maybe just my ego though. I have flown a couple of small plane but never pursued my pilots license. I think it is realistic.
Works well with windows 8.1.
Yes, I've installed it on Windows 7, 64 bit OS and it's working
I'm using 8.1 myself and I have not encounter any issues.
Hi, The Steam needs an internet download of upto 15 gb's. Regards
Yes
I've never had that issue. Mine works great with both of my dual shock 2 controllers. It could be that they aren't true sony controllers, or that a button has been configured to be automatically activated. try reconfiguring the buttons and if that fails reinstall the drivers. If that doesn't work, your unit might be defective. also make sure your controller doesn't have stuck buttons inside, I had that happen once, had to take it apart and clean it with windex and cotton swabs.
You bet.
Yeah this does work with windows 8.1
Yes, have been using it on my laptop that is running windows 8.1 x64
I bought this keyboard even after reading some of the complaints. It's great. Some seldom used key combinations have issues. The one problematic key combination is CTL+R+any key. CTL+R does work fine though. Some use CTL to crouch in games (I use ALT) so you can see where CTL+R+W migt be an issue. http://prosperouspoverty.blogspot.com/2009/02/microsoft-sidewinder-x6-gaming-keyboard.html has a great write up on the board and addresses concerns for purchasers including the problematic key combinations. The noise about the lack of height adjusters on the back IMO is over blown since the board slopes slightly upwards. Additionally the non removable hand rest is higher than my Saitek Elcipse was so I haven't had a problem. This was my one main concern and I thought worse case I would put something under to slant it but I haven't had to.
roughly 41cm without the keypad
this has been release for a couple of days now. You can purchase it now on Amazon!
yes, I have a 3ds XL and it works fine.
Yes
No multiplayer. It wouldn't really make sense for this game
It is a port of the PS1 version, which should have all the endings, as well cinematic and some bonus features.
Yes it is. They have some new dungeons and features you can use with the touch screen but you can shut that off.
It does. 3DS is backwards-compatible, and plays all Nintendo DS games.
Unfortunately, there is no Spanish in this.
It will for sure, but for future reference, it will not be compatable with 3ds or dsi enhancement games from other regions. Fortunately though, any plain ds game is fair game.
Yes
Not really sure but it's not likely that you would be getting a pirated copy if you get it at a reliable sources or website, but if you're not sure don't take the risk just trust your gut.

There is a volume scroll .scroll to the right and it should get louder if not then you might have a defective pair
Yes, it will
Mine broke just after a month..... looking for a better one
My so called chatpad has not worked from the day I got it.
No, nor is it wireless.
It sounds really weird like loud and echoey
No this is plugged directly into the bottom of the Xbox 360 controller only.
Yep all
Depends where you live and which speed of shipping you chose
This headset is just to talk to friends and people. You can't hear the game. But, it is useful I like to chat with my friends.
Yeah it's a really good simulator and pretty realistic. I bought a pretty decent joystick for it too to enhance the experience. You can get one for about $20. I like using all the different plane options, and it'll also teach you patience because dinner flights last pretty long. Overall I like it a lot. You may want to take other opinions though because I don't really know much about flying or how nice other simulators are.
Trike Bike, Piper Cub, Cessna, Float Planes, Twin Engine Aircraft, about seven different Jets,737,747,Airbus,Helicopters, and more than one plane in each category, it would take time to name all the planes, and there are flights to and from almost every continent in the world, it would take a long time to accomplish every thing that this simulator teaches you to do and all the cockpits and gauges are realistic to the lane you are flying. For the money the best piece of software that I bought.
I haven't purchased GSX or used it, but you'll have to buy it separately if you don't have it already. You should really refer to the GSX support for that, and also you can ask on the www.flightsim.com forums. Really good help there. You probably need to download the FSUIPC module and put it in your Flight Simulator X\Modules folder. FSUIPC is required for 99% of your addons, the module is free for basic use. FSUIPC: http://www.schiratti.com/dowson.html
No you can use the key board and mouse but a joystick makes it a lot easier. If you using windows I have all kinds of problems. iT SHUTS OFF in the middle of flights. If I knew when I purchased it I would not have wasted my money.
yes. Last upgrade by Microsoft special group was 2009.
We ship only by First Class Priority mail, which needs regular 4-10 working days to USA.
contact the seller in your account information under orders.
I have Window 8 and have no problem installing the game.
So far I've no problems it playing any original xbox games
Hello, We are sorry but we can't (Amazon doesn't have this ability) attach pictures to general questions. We are not sure but we might be able to send a picture if you use "Ask the Seller Question"?? Sorry for the trouble.
Find a Game Exchange i.e. "Game X-Change," They specialize in restoring retro systems and selling retro parts/games/consoles. I'm sure you could even log on to a game x-change website and find what ya need man, believe me there's a huge market out there for retro systems and retro game play.
110 thanks for your question Mj
its a basic internet cable in the back of the console that connects to an Ethernet device. there is no wireless adapter. please remember that Microsoft mo longer supports online gaming for this device so you will need to connect it to another service. like Kai. (an Xbox LAN connector powered by your PC)
Yeah you can you can buy some on amazon and other places lukie is also a good place for old games thats were i get all my old games
It still works but there is no longer support for online gaming.
No
If you have the proper power adapter or correct cable in respect to your region or country, it should work!
No it did not come with controllers, just the console.
Yes
For me it worked in Battlefield 4 in the search menu. The touch pad didn't work though.
Yes. It works fine. Only drawback is that it is on top of the remote and not the bottom where the PS4 is now on the bottom. It works fine.
I never tried pairing it with other blutooth device, but I believe it could be done.. at least I paired a blutooth earphone from third party to my PS3, so I guess there would have no problem!!
No. Sorry, Just double checked with my PS2. That controller is too small to accomodate, configured differently and is not wireless.
The key does not light up, there are 3 or 4 small lights around the edges, but those only tell you either it's charging or its on. You cannot see the buttons in the dark. Like any key pad, you will get use to where the buttons are over time but this pad is not really made to have long conversations, it's best utilized for short messages. I had my doubts when I first brought it, but for me it was a good investment.
I have read in an official sony Ps3 forum that yes, it works but there are some buttons that doesn't work with ps4 only on ps3. But the letters works fine as far i can read... Pd: i don't have a ps4 yet! Pd: sorry for my bad english!
Sorry. It's design is quite limited. Check with PS3 support. Maybe there's a way around it.
No. Only for PC MASTER RACE
Yes it does.
Yes it is fully compatible with FSX. I am running it with FSX on Windows 8.1 with no issues.
Yes
I have not tried it, but per the manufacturer and the OEM packaging it is compatible with XP/Vista/7. I am running 8.1 and it works as expected.
No it does not have force feedback
Rudder control is by twisting the stick left or right.
Yes it will. You have to clear all the default joystick setting tho in the game. It's pretty straight forward. However, Ive noticed that in BF4 there is a button or two that seems to be bugged. I use the two buttons in front of the throttle to afterburner, and it keeps opening up a damn menu. In all honesty, it works wonders in BF3... But worst in BF4, They seem to have optimized it mainly for the game pad and mouse/keyboard... At least when flying a heli. "i'm not much of a jet guy."
its very responsive, once u move it, it moves your aircraft...hope this helps :)
Kind of. I really haven't played it in sometime. I would search more on YouTube on it
Yes as your X52 is an integrated flight stick system. Consisting of a throttle and a stick similar to a fighter jet set up in theory. This will add more to it as it also is Saitek and it allows functions not capable of the X52. This will be a nice addition to your setup.
All of Saitek's products are programmable and therefore can be modified in simulators such as FSX etc. I am not familiar with your simulator or program but I am sure that you can obtain the map of the buttons and knobs and therefore change their functionality.
Yes but you have to visit saitek.com downloads for the mac drivers.
It's hard to be sure what you mean. Complexity of Setup: Easy...just a USB plug. Complexity of Panel Switches: Not at All. It's a decent-looking panel, but has a "lightweight" feel, which could be good for some, bad for others. Be aware, though, (since I wasn't), that this panel is only compatible with FSX, and possibly Prepar3d.
The Saitek Pro Flight Switch Panel and other Saitek Panels using the Saitek drivers work only with Microsoft products, but if you go to x-plane.org you can download a driver that will do the job. You will have to switch each panel during the X-Plane boot up to get the program to recognize that the Saitek Panels are on and available. All functions seem to work.
Yes, If you have it off before you start xplane (This is what I use) and then try to turn it on, it won't. You will need to reset the game or move you plane via the map to a different location. Before the computer screen loads, you will need to switch it back to Start then BOTH. Hope This helps.
Yes there are drivers available for Win7 and Win8 for both 32bit and 64bit systems.
Its a computer attachment si yes it should work no problem specially if you have win7 and up where driver updates are automatic.
I am not sure!, you can go to their site to find out " http://www.saitek.com/ ", take care!!
Yes. Be warned, though, that's is only compatible with Microsoft FSX. The driver software does not allow for custom programming, it has a plugin that automatically loads with FSX.
This does *not* work with a MacBook Pro. I ordered one for my Mac without realizing the input jack on the laptop is line-level. The mic-level output is insufficient meaning no sound can be heard when speaking (although the headset *can* be used for listening). The Mac requires a USB or Bluetooth headset.
standard : regular sized headset, small, no adjustable / reaching mic, not padded in most cases, sound quality plus: padded, a little more comfortable, nice size mic, medium size headset, reasonably priced (depending on where its purchased)
I've used mine with my PS3 via a USB adapter. Works fine, but the cord is a bit short.
Regrets, but I cannot help there ... I bought it for PC/Skype, not gaming. All it is is basically a set of speakers (headphones) and a microphone, so I'd imagine it would work with your game system, but it won't do anything like vibrate or whatever game-specific headgear might do.
yeah, but you need a adapter
I am not sure? I use mine for my desktop PC and my laptop. Still works great :)
It has 3.5 mm jacks for the mic and ear phones. I don't have a ps3 but I use it for PC
I don't know if you would be able to use the microphone but there are all types of adapters that convert the pink and green jacks into various devices. Just type in "pc to ps3 headset adapters" and find one that you think will work for you.
Yes, the headphones are adjustable. I've noticed that some reviews said that they weren't. Not true. Is it suitable for an 8 year old? I don't see why not. The 'phones are comfortable and well padded, which helps block outside noise. They also have a volume control and a mute button, which is good when your dad yells, "Turn that dang thing off"! The mic is on an adjustable boom which can be pulled close or moved out of the way completely. That's what I do when I use them as studio headphones, which as I stated in my review, are surprisingly good. Now, for the last part of the question- I have no idea how an "Xbox Live" works. These headphones have the standard green, (for headphone), and pink, (for mic), plugs which mate with a computer. However I'm sure that there are suitable adapters. I use a mini to 1/4" adapter to use them on my mixer. I hope this helps. Like I said, for the price they can"t be beat.
Yes. As long as you have a 3.5mm jack to connect this headset's own 3.5mm jack, than it will work great.
I measured mine, about 14" front to back on the yoke and stem shaft. 12" side to side, and about 8" high.
No
yes I have done it you can assign any of the buttons whatever task you'd like it to do- but for my use now I strictly use the Yoke for flying commercial type flights or just general aircraft. In my opinion I would have a stick type joystick if you are going to do allot of combat flying, I have a stick type also for when I get that itch. but this yoke really does put some realism into your flying hope that helps
Other than re-calibrating/centering - sorry no.
Yes, it works with windows 8.
Yes. Both work on an axis just like the throttle. If you watch the lower cockpit, you can see the aircraft controls move in response.
Sorry I don't know on the Mac I use mine on a PC . if had it to do over again I'd get the regular CH yoke and buy the rudder peddels separate. But you can go to the CH website and check for compatibly with the Mac
Yes, you can. Works without problems. Mountain Lion.
I am using it on a MAC. Great device.
yes
This game is for the Wii, and it can be played on the Wii U, but not other Nintendo systems such as the DS, 3DS, etc.
Yes
Up to four
It came in the original case unsure if it came with Manual but was in good condition
Yes sir
You do not need the steering wheel at all to play. You can use the Wii mote by itself, or the wii more + chuck combination
No
We have played with 4 racers at a time
I just had my son test it. You can NOT use the game pad you need a Wii remote

No, this will only work if you have an account on the US playstation store, your physical geographic location does not matter.
My son is the one who use card as my christmas gift so i will ask him but its only the Registration is the difference but the manufacturer is still the same it may still be working. What you can do ask some info around in there. It will a lot compare i live in canada so don't have much idea about it.
the only difference I see is the price, it costs 57 black and blue 49.99
According to the official playstation website: http://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstationnetwork/playstation-store/ , all PSN cards should work on the PS4, PS3 and PSN.
No, delivery is through the postal system. It is a physical card with a code on it. The picture is an actual picture of the card.
Yes, you can use it anywhere in the world, however only on the US playstation store.
Yes, is the better (almost the only) way!
Yes yes it does. The PSN es network agnostic so funds will be seen by your account and all the devices registered to it.
I would think that all psn cards work on all operational gaming systems
No, this charger stops when the controls is completly chargeds
This is only for PS3 controllers. They don't come with battery packs. All you have to do is push the controller into the slot and it charges. It's really easy.
No. PS3 is Mini USB (This product) PS4 is Micro USB. Completely different cables. Even if the notches of the charger line up it won't physically fit.
Yes, its support both voltage.
It's Bivolt. 110-240V
It has an AC adapter and doesn't require the console to charge the controls.
Yes
I wouldn't recommend it. Because it could be fire-hazard, or treat it as one , just to be on the safe side. &#128549;
I take them off once charged. Probably not good to have a constant charge going in.
Yes
Yes it runs in Windows 8, the newer version of Hoyle is not as user friendly, so I like the old version better.
yes, I had no trouble downloading onto mine Windows 8
No, my husband downloaded the cd, put an icon on the front screen and all I have to do is click on the icon. The game menu comes up and I can select the game I want to play. Really cool!!
Yes there is Hearts,but I don't see Canfield.
yes very well.
Yes
Yes, it does, and many, many other variations.
Yes, "Gin" and also "Rummy 500" are listed in the contents. Have fun! This is an excellent program.
While this lists quite a number of card games, I see no sign that it has the capacity for tournament play.
yes I love to play it too
Use compatibility mode
No
yes it does, I have a kindle fire and it works great with it.
Sorry, no it won't I purchased it on Windows xp and then I had to switch to windows eight, tried several times to download it and it just won't work. I purchased Reef one, two and three. loved them and makes me angry it won't work. Any more questions or concerns please let me know.

The psp 3000 has a 3.5mm headphone jack according to various websites (i can honestly stick in most of my normal headphones/earbuds) The PSP 3000 does have built in speakers. Also note that I believe the psp 3000 does not have internal memory so you will need a memory stick for your files.
No, it does not include a camera. However this model is compatible with the (separately sold) psp camera
it dose not come with a memory stick but you can get one on amazon for a good price I love my psp
Yes it will
Yes, the PSP will plug into a PS3. It uses the same mini-usb cable the PS3 controllers use. There is not a whole lot you can do with it other than transferring games, however remote play is still possible with a select list of supported games.
Yes its still the same standard UMD (game discs)
I am afraid not. This is a separate console compared to the PS Vita. Think of this as the PS2, and the Vita is the PS3. Now as for the, not seeing games that come with this, this is just a specific model of PSP, any game labeled as a PSP game will work on this console, just as any game labeled as PS Vita will only work on the Vita. Hope this helps.
The PSP was discontinued by Sony in 2012 and replaced with the PSVita. New games on the UMD's are no longer being released either; however, the PSP is still supported by the PlayStation Network as far as I know and there are plenty of great games floating around on amazon for the PSP.
No beacuse the psp vita games have a higher graphic engine and it will not support it on the psp 3000
I would think so. I download to my kindle. It s a playrix game and on Amazon you can get it for your Ipad. Have fun with it. Love the game
yes it does

I have read a post elsewhere that said it doesn't have Starforce at least on The Two Thrones, for the current $9, I'll buy this since I have been holding off on the third game because of it. Can post again once I install it and check for myself... EDIT: The game came up clean after doing a scan with ProtectionID. Unless it's hiding deep in the game, it's good! In fact, all three discs came up clean.
I bought this at the NEX (Navy Exchange) almost a year back, and didn't notice any censoring.. decapitations were definitely abundant..
Last machine I ran it on was a win7 republic of gamers laptop. It had to run in compatability mode, but I was able to play it (with minimal hicups, but some graphical degradation) I was using a beefy spec rig though, your mileage may vary. I havent tested it on windows 8/8.1
Yes
I got past the lack of gamepad support on the first game by using a gamepad/keyboard mapper, Pinnacle Game Profiler in my case. However, there was a free one entitled Xpadder, though I am not sure if it is still free... It will allow mapping of a controller's buttons using the keyboard keys the game uses. Also, I didn't need one for Warrior Within since the game itself can map most gamepads I hear and had no problem using my XBOX 360 controller after setting it up myself. While I haven't played The Two Thrones yet, I am sure it's the same for that one too. Just Google the two programs listed above and you'll be fine I think! :)
I guess its better graghics, I think the old version was DOS based and the new version is windows based, unless I am showing my age and there was another version between the DOS based and Windows based games.
Yes! Flawlessly.
It comes with programmable software installed on the joystick itself, so you can custom program each and every button to do whatever you want. So while it is geared towards flight control, I'm sure you can get it to do much more on other games.
It's perfectly semetrical in every aspect, it could be used with either hand.
Yes
I haven't had any trouble and no signs of it weakening on me at all its been overall the best one I have ever had
Yes
Works well with War Thunder, that's why I got it.
No
No
Yes it should work.
Yes, works with all windows platforms from xp and up.
Hello, to answer your question, most guys just put a different wheel on the G27 body instead of trying to modify the existing setup. Here is a video of just one idea from Utube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHGmBHoygJA There are other ideas out there too. If you insist of taking the leather off the wheel (from my experience - And I have had a G25 for years and bought me a G27 when one of my wheel buttons began to malfunction. I have modified the shifter so I can have sequential shifting but that is all I care to do to the wheel. If you decide to take off the wheel leather, I wish you luck as it looks like it is really on there. :) -Val
Yes the gas pedal is realistic. I use mainly for racing but i can go around a track at 2 miles an hour or 102 or anywhere in between. for the money i recomend this wheel setup to anyone. i am sure the more expensive wheels have a better feature or two but not much better. also recomend iracing and asseto corsa for the most realistic racing experience available in my opinion, if into racing games.
The gear shifter is not fixed to the steering unit and can be mounted anywhere you choose to mount it.
It has up to 900 degress of rotation.
No it doesn't, it moves to where they are supposed to go but there is no spring that returns the stick shift to the neutral position after you take it out of gear. It kind of just sits there. In real cars the stick shift springs to center below 3rd gear and above 4th gear. This makes it so when you go from 2nd gear to 3rd gear you just have to push the stick up, instead of up, then right then up again. With the springing to center you just push it up and when it gets to neutral it springs right by itself and you just continue pushing it up to 3rd gear. (Sorry for the explanation which you probably already know, but it's for others who don't.)
this is the answer i got for the same question I am positive that the G27 will not work in the PS4 for now because of the absence of a Sony PS4 security chip in it. Without this chip, the G27 shuts down in 8 minutes. This is how Sony protects its PS4 license. It may work in the future if Logitech manages to negotiate a deal with Sony. The 8-minute shutdown restriction can surely be circumvented by a firmware upgrade. There is actually a petition going around among G27 owners for that to happen.
I just received my G27. It looks like the U.S. version will work in your country by just replacing the plug-in AC power cord if your outlet plugs are different from U.S. Fortunately that part plugs into the brick and should be easily replaced. The included power supply specs are: AC Input: 100 - 240Vac, 50-60 Hz, 1.0 Amp maximum DC Output: 24Vdc, 1.75 A LPS (Limited Power Source) Center = + (positive) It is a black brick design 105x47x27 mm. by APD (Asian Power Devices). It is pretty lightweight, 5.0 net wt. oz for the brick part. The output plug is a standard 2.1 mm ID (inner diameter) x 5.5 mm OD straight barrel about 12 mm long permanently attached output wire is approximately 5 feet long (about 1.7 meters). An L shaped barrel should also fit. The AC cord appears to be 6 feet (1.9 M) long with a standard non-polarized 2 flat blades without a third ground plug for U.S. outlets. The AC wire plugs into a standard looking figure 8 receptical on the brick. FYI, the most import AC adapter specs are ink stamped on the bottom of all Logitech wheel bases. I need a magnifying glass to read them. It looks like any standard laptop 24vac, 1.75 A AC adapter. P.S. I went overboard with the description because I recently discovered the adapter for my Logitech Driving Force GT disappeared during Spring cleaning. I have saved a lot of nondescript AC adapters half of which are no longer married to the original products. Logitech Customer Support blew off my request to buy a new part. They suggested buying a laptop AC adapter from a local electronics chain. I found those 24 Vac, 0.75 A. (DFGT spec, not G27), center positive adapters come in so many shapes and sizes, regulated and unregulated, long and short wires, and prices from 9.95 including shipping to US$130 plus shipping. I wish I had a detailed description of that part.
Ps3 and PC only, XBOX 360 does not accept this wheel, only Microsoft branded wheels can be used on XBOX
Turning is relatively quiet, compared to the driving force gt. If u use the manual shifter it's quite loud, shifting, but the wheel turning isn't that bad. It does make a bit of noise tho but you should be fine if the there are others in another room. My girl sleeps in the other room when I sometimes stay up l8 to play, but it doesn't bother her. I would recommend. Good luck!
It only works with Windows Media Player. it has a small number of apps that came with it that aren't really very helpful, it looks like they went "pretty" over "Functionality" and scouring the web, pretty much all the app sites for aftermarket apps are gone now, but I DID find a program called Aida64 that can be used to create custom apps, that's all I've used since I made one for system stats. and game support for it is pretty light. google it and read the wiki on the g19 and you can see the list of games that support it. nothing terribly new so not sure if games are even trying to offer support.
What is the competing brand you are looking at? Does it also have an LCD?
This keyboard is not wireless capable. In the gaming community, wireless is unacceptable -- time lag, etc. This keyboard needs plugging into both USB2 and electricity. It even prefers a USB port on the computer itself, not on a hub. If you want a wireless, try the Logitech K350. It doesn't have the bells and whistles of a gaming board but is excellent in all other computer functions.
Hi, unfortunately the whole set of keys will have the same colour. I figured out why individual keys are lighted so dim, it is largely due to having too small see-thru sections for the lighting to come through. Still, it is a sturdy keyboard. I am pounding on it and it is working fine. As for Mice, the corded G600 is excellent for its price. Superb Value. My hand doesn't cramp grasping it for hours on end.
The macros are not fully compatible with every program, So i do not know. Also keep in mind that its a gaming keyboard so its made mainly for gamers. I dont think the macros display on the LED screen on the keyboard, but they do have a separate program that lets you see all your macros that you program. Honestly though, this keyboard isn't as fantastic as it sounds, the youtube app doesn't even let you browse for certain videos :/
What do you mean by using it? To navigate through the different apps you use the directional pads to either side of it. As for adding, removing and configuring the apps, you need to download and install the Logitech Gaming Software.
I assume that you're referring to the plug on the AC power adapter. That 2-prong AC plug fits any standard household 110 VAC power socket right out of the box... it doesn't need the 3rd (grounding) pin that you see on most AC power plugs nowadays. And, you can plug it in either way - it doesn't matter. Enjoy your keyboard.
No it's not a mechanical keyboard. If you HAVE to have a mechanical keyboard get the razor black widow. I actually returned the black widow for the g19 because my G15 gave out after 3 years, I got it used too (R.I.P), and I wanted to give the newer model of the g15 a chance.. I've never regretted it since. The display is amazing, the keys feel excellent. This is a 10/10 keyboard in my eyes. The screen tells you all the details you want to know about gaming. For instance, I play league of legends. It tells me my gold per second, current crit%, kdr etc.. its amazing. I love the volume scroll. You can play youtube off it slide shows and so much more!! Hope this helps, good luck!
I use this headset with Vent, Teamspeak, Mumble, RazorComms and others. Not sure if that answers your question. If not, please be more specific.
League of Legends: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SO2MBw3P8E There is no applet for Dota, according to the forums. I don't play any of the games so I can't tell you for sure.
While Windows 8 is not listed, it should work with Windows 8.1 I briefly tested it and it required the disk in the drive to work.
I bought this version (Scrabble Champion Edition Jewel case) and it works PERFECTLY for me in Win7. Save the $2-3 and buy the jewel case, we all throw away the box anyway. It's a good game too.
Hi Roseola. Although I never tried, I checked it out for you and it looks like "no". You may play against against the clock, or take your time; play yourself (solitare), the computer (and choose from 8 levels of difficulty) or against a human (who puts in their own identity) and plays against you wherever the two of you may be. Sorry about that, but I did not see internet options. It did, however, have some interesting perks: Auto Word Validation, Pop-up Hints if requested, and a few "Best Plays" if you ever just get stumped, as well as, a Merriam-Webster Official Scrabble Dictionary built right in. Hope you find what you are looking for.
Works OK on my windows 7.
YES
Yes, it does. Some minor problems that I cannot fix are it plays on full screen (so horizontally enlarged) and a bit blur screen probably due to the 32/64 bit difference (not sure tho).
It's just Classic Scrabble; timed or untimed; play against the computer or solitaire. You can play with more players on the same computer. It has 8 levels, from Beginner to Genius. I have Windows 7 and it works fine.
While I don't have Windows 8 on my own computer, my husband does and he uses this game nightly so can't see why you'd have any problems.
NO. It comes on a CD that has to be in the CD-player every time you play it.
It works with Windows XP Pro, I don't see anywhere that says on the disc that it works only with specific versions, although I didn't get the box. It is a great game, & if it doesn't, u can ask Amazon to exchange it or issue you credit. It's a win-win situation.
Yes they will
It should work with any wii game that needs a steering wheel. Its not the steering wheel itself that really makes a difference it's whether or not you can turn the controller sideways and use that the way u would a steering wheel cause the controller just fits inside it. But I gotta say you don't have to worry about the controller sliding out of these steering wheels or setting loosely inside cause it is made to fit a wii controller perfectly.
I purchased them for my Grandson and they seem to work fine for him....he is only 6. :)
You can use regular Wii remotes.. Hope this helps
the wheels are designed to accommodate a Wii controller. the mario kart version should not have any impact on it's fit.
It can be used with a remote with the Wii plus built in, but not with one where the plus part snaps onto the bottom of the remote.
NO,it's plastic
Yes. I recently bought the Wii Mini w/ the remote plus included. It fits in the wheel perfectly.
I'm pretty sure it will. I think the wii remotes are all the same size.
U put the remote control in the wheel without the skin
Yes!
Even though the cover says it is only for XP and Vista, it runs on both Windows 7 & 8.
The games are actually on the discs, they are to my knowledge the full game.
I am not sure but it does have settings for you too customize it for your own use or kids use.
Windows Vista / XP Only
Mystery Cookbook, Alabama Smith, Treasure Masters, Heroes of Hellas, Pet Show Craze, Farm Frenzy 2, Beach Party Craze, Supermarket Mania, Fashion Craze, Jewel Quest, Mystery of the Bermuda Triangle, Natalie Brooks, others. Heroes of Hellas is my favorite. Mostly hidden object games.
Good question! I'm always curious about things like that myself. But this game is completely written for your computer. NO internet is required to download or play, either one. And, you also have the option to custom download which games you actually want. But if you don't know what the games are, I suggest downloading them all, and going back through each menu separately, and double click 'uninstall' on the ones you don't want. No internet is required at any point.
yes it does!
yes
Windows 7 is not real "game" friendly. I will work so long as you set the game to work under Win XP. But you need to change the compatibility settings for the program, either manually or by using the Program Compatibility troubleshooter.
Hi I have recently bought a new Laptop which uses the Vista operating system. And so far have had no problems installing games. Many of the games I play are old 2005-7 and all seem to run no problems. Also newer games such as Age of Empires and Medieval Total War II are running well under Vista
Remember that all things are backward compatible. Which means newer technology will run older programs but older technology may or may not run the newer the newer programs.
no you have to buy a new copy once the code is used it's invalid
The games are completely different, and they are relatively disconnected from one another. However, the two main connections lie with the Hall of Monuments and the back story. The Hall of Monuments was a place in Guild Wars where you could display your achievements. Based on the amount of titles and rewards one has achieved, they are awarded skins and other items unobtainable elsewhere in the game. and via this website: https://hom.guildwars2.com/en/ one could calculate the amount of awards they will be given. I hope this answers your question!
Once the game is installed, you play from the internet. You'll get weekly updates that download when you log in. There is no need to have the CD in the computer. Just be connected to the internet.
Yes, but it has some problems. It is definitely playable but it is slightly more glitchy.
Yes, better graphics, but gameplay is similar.
If you didn't order a download, then yes the code will arrive in the box, you will have to wait until the package is delivered to you
If you selected the "PC" box and not the "PC Download" box underneath the "Platform" options on the page, then yes it will receive a physical copy of the game. You will need the code that comes in the box before you can play the game. You could always try the "PC Download" option if you didn't want to wait for shipping. Please note that if you select "PC Download" you will not be getting a physical copy.
Yes! It plays well on Windows 7, 8 8.1 and even Vista.
In order to play GW2 all you need to get is either GW2 or GW2 the deluxe version. (As well as a computer, internet connection, mouse/controller, etc.) GW1 and it's expansions really are not necessary to play GW2. All it might do is unlock certain items in GW2 that you can only get from GW1(All cosmetic, and not game changing in the least). The regular version of GW2 just comes with the game: you buy the game, create an account, download it and you are good to go. The deluxe version comes with the game and a few other little things(Once again not at all game breaking or especially advantageous). TL DR: You just need the regular version of GW2 to play the game.
Yes
This is for US consoles.
1. delete your file & create a new one (this usually works pretty good). 2. try using fewer codes (if you use to many codes they start to do weird things). 3. spend the extra money & invest in a gameshark (it's a much better product overall).
I couldn't even get mine to play a European copy of the movie Tank Girl staring Lori Petty. My PS2 is a US MODEL # SPCH-77001. It is a slim, soft modded, and will not play black bottom or blue bottom disc's so I can't use my GameShark to launch anything which is why I like the Action Replay Max due to it having a silver bottom which is the same for the Swap Magic, so be sure of what kind of bottoms your PS2 can play. The Action Replay is to allow you to turn your PS2 into a region 0 or region x DVD drive reader for movies and not games. So no it won't let you play your imported games. I would go with a Swap Magic if you are looking to play backups or imports on your PS2. I have Swap Magic and it allows me to play all my backups, imports, and I even have a back up of my Action Replay Max because my soft moded PS2 won't play the original but my backup copy will and it works with my backup games. You can find PS2 Swap Magic NTSC USA here on Amazon or on ps2cover.com or stoneagegamer.com who are selling it for $24.74 plus tax on ps2cover and sold out on stone age gamer, and that's without the lid for the slim ps2 if you have a fat ps2 you will need the slide tool. If you have a slim u will need the flip top cover unless you soft mod your slim like I did and then you don't need the flip top but I'm thinking of picking up the lid and buying another slim PS2 and use it on that and not soft mod it because then I can probably use my region free function and watch my import DVD's using my Action Replay MAX. "Be sure to get the NTSC U.S.A. version of swap magic if you have a U.S. PS2". The PAL version is for non North and South American PS2'S so be sure of what version you are purchasing. If u want to play backup PS1 and imported PS1 games on your PS2 I would recommend the Breaker PRO NTSC, and this can be found on ps2cover also for $19.95. I still need to buy one due to my PS2 won't read my GameShark due to it's blue bottom. I hope this helped you and also the Swap Magic NTSC version 3.8 DVD comes with some cheat codes but I haven't had any games to try them out with. When i bought my Swap Magic it stated that the DVD disc was version 3.6 but I received version 3.8 along with version 3.8 CD. I hope i was able to help you out a little bit.
los angeles
It has some base line cheats for the main characters. However, in searching the internet, you can find proper cheats for the game, including leveling up faster, always getting an item with a monster battle, always going first. I do not like the base line cheats as they are auto maximum stats and levels for the characters, no fun at all. But, the found cheats, allowing a little help and going faster through the game without having to spend hours leveling up.. those make the game very enjoyable. Hope this helps.
I don't know because I can't get it to work.
I don't think it matters which model number the PS2 is. I have heard that it does better on the old PS2 "fat". I've had both the newer slim and the older fat consoles, and I like the older PS2 'fat" better.
It might not work in India, but try see if it does work.
Maybe it might not sure
No, it uses the PS2 card that comes with it.
you can buy it on steam for 29.99
Yep. It's a 32bit program, so you shouldn't have any issues.
Yep. I have W7Pro 64bit. No issues.
Yes you can. But still have the option to use letter and numbers keys and sometimes it makes it easier. For example, when you want to give someone $250, you would have to click the up arrow 250 times unless you type in "250". This is the only time I really used the keyboard rather than the mouse.
not sure - but with Window's 8 and 8.1 you have a compatibility mode that can set the Operating System that runs the game back to prior versions of Windows. And note, when I say, Operating System - it's just the environment that the game runs in, not your overall PC Operating System Environment. With Windows you can keep checking as it checks each prior version of Windows to see which one the game works on, and when it does, it will "Set" it in its memory. That way whenever you do run the game in the future, it knows what settings it needs in order to run. Good Luck.
As far as I know, you can't. However, you may be able to find it on line, just make sure to look for the Mac symbol. Hope this helps, Eric
I installed it on windows 8 and it work. The game was way more "old school" than I like so I didn't play it much.
Yes
Yea, they worked perfectly fine on my windows 7, no patches or nothing
No
I could not get it to run on win 7
Yes and no. Included with the games is a copy of dosbox, a dos emulator that will run the games on windows 8. However, Fallout Tactics is unplayable unless you can find a crack that will allow you to run the game without the disc.
The games overall are not censored. Although there is an option in the pause menu that allows you to turn off the gore/blood and guts when someone dies.
no it cant
i have windows 7 64 bit and i had issues with it. updated firware and all. Got the replacement and it did the same thing. Updated that firmware and same thing. The pointer just randomly moves on its own. It is an issue with this operating system you can google it. Tracking issue for mamba mouse. They say it could be from having stuff like hard drives running on the computer desk but not in my case just my keyboard and mouse and monitor.
You need to download the firmware then run it. You might have to resync your mouse with the base afterward.
-_- Here comes the racism.... WHO GIVES A SH**T!
Yes, it supports PAL
No, its pretty old
No they are not the same character.
I could not find any option for any other language. Sorry
No add-on needed to play multiplayer online although you can buy some new maps and weapons I guess.
Not sure. I sold the game in less than a blink!
Yes. Any Wii controller will work with the Wii u. But it won't work with Wii motion plus games.
It is one controller with two parts. The main rectangular controller which is used for all games and the nunchuk controller which plugs into the first controller and is used on some games.
I had a very hard time. I held the sync buttons down for a while and it worked once then never would sync again. If you want your money back , contact customer service (Amazon) immediately
No
Yes it does
yes
No you don't need one it takes batteries.
Yes.
no they do not. they are regular controllers
I can't speak to this but we are very happy with the controller. We use it for Skylanders, Mario Kart, and Sports Resort. It works just as effectively as the Nintendo brand one we also have, these are extras. I don't know if this helps....
Nope
Yes! I used a gamecube controller, but there is a classic controller for the wii. You can also use the wiimote only, but I think that would be really hard xD. This remake is absolutely amazing. Definitely try it out! The GC controller is what I recommend.
If you have the controller for the wii you can play this game without the nunchuck
Not in the traditional sense, this has no elements found in many RPGs. Other than playing the role of the (player choice) character selected from the very beginning, you play out the respective role of that S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics And Rescue Service) team member with no customization abilities.. No experience feature, no gear upgrades or crafting, no turn-based battle. This is about as far from those types of RPGs as you can get, and not considered to be one at all. It spawned a whole genre (Survival/Horror) following this game's debut.
Yes because the Wii u console and controller are backwards compatible with Wii games.
Should be able to since Wii U is backwards compatible but I am not positive on that since I don't have a Wii U.
no sorry i cant ship to saudi arabia
Yes. WiiU has backward compatibility so that you can play your old Wii games. Just have your remote, speakers up, and let the scary fun times begin lol
No. Unfortunately, not. Wii games can only be played on the Wii U with the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers. Some of them can also be played with the Wii Classic Controller, but it depends on the game (Check the back cover). I too, have a Wii U and wish I could use my Wii U Pro Controller for playing Wii games...
No, this version does not require steam. The entire reason I bought this game was because it does not have steam at all.
I also love Civ IV. You have to go into the files and download it to your desktop. I believe you want the run ex file. That should do the trick, if not just email me and I will help you after work. topgram11@gmail.com
windows 7 is listed
I have Windows 7 so I can't say for sure; but my guess is that it would work well on 8.1 64 bit edition.
No. The only way you can play this game without the disc is by purchasing a digital copy.
I am hoooked on Warlords game. Civ iii & iV Complete Edition will play with out a disk. find a source to download the program from and have at it.
I believe the game checks for the disk. No drive, no disk
Yes
It was not included in my copy of the game. I should think that if you had to old poster that it would cover the present game.
It comes with an abridged instruction booklet (I think) and a dvd in a plastic case. Is this what you meant?
Not sure I understand your question. This is a customizing case for the hardware. No software comes with this purchase.
I installed the ghost case along with the whisper fan with no problem. still running strong after a year of heavy use.
No special tools needed at all. Also, the fans work really well with the casing. If u send me your email address I can send you a pic of what it looks like after its all installed.
When I replaced mine I just used a flat head screw driver and a knife. When it got to the clips on the back of the casing I just grabbed both halves at the front and ripped it open. The casing started to bend but the clips came undone and there was no damage at all. Of course proceed at your own risk
Just the case
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPuf8KXAK88 as to installing the new case, just play the video backwards, the case is identical to the factory case so it should go on without problems. help it helps! :)
Mope
Yes
No. You get four options to choose from for your response.
yes
Hi, No, the one you are looking at is for Windows. To find a Mac one, go to the Amazon Search and type in Jeopardy Deluxe Mac and you should find them. The box is white for the mac, blue for the windows. Thanks. Rocky
You can play with up to 3 live players at home.
Yes it does and is very easy to upload to your pc.
I run mine on my laptop but did not buy a special version. I have Windows 7 but found that it works better on a previous version.For most things I run my laptop as a pc.
Yes, it works on Windows 7. I installed mine and it download just fine. I have a HP laptop computer. I recommend this Jeopardy game and The Price Is Right.
Yes. Bought it for my GF and she has windows 7
This product lets you convert from the RF output with RCA-type plug on the computer/game console to a F-type RF antenna male connector that screws into your TV F-Type antenna input directly. That means, you have to unscrew the CATV provider cable from the TV and plug this one coming from the console in order to use it. In order to avoid having to go to the back of the TV set every time to switch inputs, you can plug both this product and your CATV signal coaxial cable into the IN connectors on a switch like this one https://www.amazon.com/RCA-VH71-Slide-Switch/dp/B00009W3F2/ref=lp_6291368011_1_10?s=lamps-light&ie=UTF8&qid=1402970350&sr=1-10 and then its TV SET output through a coaxial cable into your TV set's antenna input. Then the switch will let you select either the CATV provider or your computer/game console.
I used a cable splitter. One connection for the cable to go to the TV and another for the adapter.
Yes it does. it works better the orignal adapter.
I have used this on a few different old systems and it has worked great for each one. I think it would.
It works well on mine. I have also used it on the old Atari and it has worked well.
Yes i use in my atari and intellevicion
I believe so
It will but the NES needs an RCA cable also. Get a single RCA style cable or use half of an audio / video cable if you have one handy and plug it into the NES RF out, then the other side gets this coax adapter.
In order to work with the TV, the TV must have an OTA or "over the air" tuner, to be able to tune into the legacy channels 2-13 (VHF). If your tv does not have this type of input, you may still be able to connect it through an older VCR. If you don't have a VCR, your local thrift shop is sure to have one, but get it quick before they're all gone :) Make sure that the VCR has composite outputs that are compatible with your new digital television. If you TV only has HDMI, you should have got a different tv. You can also get an RF to composite adapter box, but these are quite pricy ($150)
It does. They're at the edge of the top left
Yes.
Home and End are located on the Num Pad and require Num Lock to be off. The F-keys are standard set up, nothing special.
No.
The device itself is. But the software is not. And some of the macroed buttons are not. And the function buttons don't work. But the side pad and stuff still do.
yes, most definitely! should you be able to get a close up shot of the keyboard to the left, you will see the six main keys in the center which includes the q, a w, s, e, d in the centermost area. all of the numeric keys are up above those from 1-11. the keys to the left of the q and a keys cover the alt, shift, caps, tab, and control keys. the keys to the right of the e an d keys cover the alphas, r, t, f, g, v, b, p, c and a "jump" key. i hope that you can get a good "visual" from the description that i gave. When I first got the keyboard, I thought that there was no way that I could become functionable with the set up. Honestly, the transition was so very fast! I first transitioned by using the keyboard to the left and at times hit some of the keys on the regular keyboard to play. I do believe that you will be very happy with it!
21.5" x 7.5"
Yes, the LED in the keyboard has 3 colour options, Red, Blue, and Purple. There's a button at the top for colour change and LED brightness.
No, I guess they're not mechanical switch keys; Steelseries would specify that on their site for this keyboard if it were I'm pretty sure. The feel is very good, so some people think it is mechanical; I can't tell by using it. I recommend you find a Bestbuy that has one and check it out; you can probably even get them to hook it up to a pc so you can try it. Then thank them for their time and buy from Amazon for the better price :)
Even though the profiles are really out of date, you can still go in and set them up any way you want. So every key is configurable for whatever you want. Just set up the profiles and make sure to select the right one before going in to your application. I've had my keyboard for a couple months now and have barely scratched the surface of the configuration options.
This one doesn't send you a code, it mails it within a week.
Just the price. It's still 12 months of xbox live.
If both grandsons intend on playing on the same account than one card would be fine. If both grandsons want to have their own separate accounts it would be better to buy 2. If they only have one xbox, I would suggest 1 for now, and if they seem to want to add another account later than so be it.
Yes, this is for XBox Live. The same as the membership that you would charge to your credit card but you are just prepaying for 12 months (I think they have a six month plan too). I'm not sure on downloading games. I think that might be different. They have XBox gift cards for that. We ordered one of those too. Hope this helps.
Yeah it gives you access to Xbox LIVE play online etc. but as soon i redeem the code it would log me off when i turn on my Xbox or even when i use my apps such as Netflix or Youtube it was working fine when I didnt have access to LIVE I need to call Xbox for support to fix the problem. This is what im experiencing after i bought it online for the first time, before i would get them at Target,711 or just straight from the menu from your Xbox.Hope this helps you out in some way.
I believe so. Even if his account expired you should just be able to reactivate with this card. Kinda like a prepaid phone card would work.
gold memberships do not expire. My iy can also redeem it now and it adds on to your membership.
It depends on who you send it to,for family and friends as a gift buy the card send them the 26 digit code on back of the card thru email or cell phone, once code is used card is no good,if it's for selling to a stranger,it won't work.
Yes it worked fine. I was worried also,but it worked fine
Yes if it has both languages just incase you dont know one of them. It could be the product was made in China but no big deal you use it and disgard or recycle once used the pin. Enjoy.

The 149.99 is for the tracker 5 only. The clip pro is not included. I have the clip pro but do not use it.
Yes. I am currently running Windows 8 and works great.
I considered buying the track clip pro as well but decided against it after reading some reviews stating how fragile it is. The benefits didn't seem to justify the additional $. Unless your monitor is facing direct sunlight and you hate wearing a cap indoors, then the track clip pro will be the way to go. Else the standard reflectors works just fine and it seems very responsive to me. No discernible lag whatsoever.
It's an IR camera that tracks head movement by bouncing IR off of a clip you attach to a hat. It's used in gaming to translate your head movement into corresponding movement in game. For example, in a flight simulator (where I use it), it is used to control your view in 3d cockpits, giving 6 degrees of freedom in the cockpit as if you were really there. It is fantastic and I highly recommend it.
The other option you have, which is what I use, is to customize the dead zone/sensitivity of the Trackir so that your head center dead zone is higher and thus will not actuate until head movement is greater than X amount of your choosing.
All supported games are listed on their website! :) http://www.naturalpoint.com/trackir/03-enhanced-games/enhanced-games-all.html
I haven't, but it doesn't have any effect on video. If you can look around with the keyboard or mouse, this will work fine. Probably be pretty cool. I don't see why it wouldn't work. Kind of a lot of gear on your head though.
The package as shown above is about eight inches tall and only a couple of ounces. It arrived in a box that was like 4" x 6" x 8". I don't have it in front of me, but the above are fairly close.
Maybe if your monitor is very thin, but it is probably best for viewing angle if its at the top.
No, it uses IR technology to "see". It has 4 IR LEDs inside the unit that provides it's own light. The light from these IR LEDs reflects off the attachment on your head (Pro-clip or the one that comes with this item) and back to the main unit where it records the location of the reflections. The following are images I googled to elaborate on how the TrackIr can "see": https://www.google.com/search?q=ir+led&safe=off&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS547US547&espv=2&biw=1920&bih=993&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=xr6eVOqhC4apyQSgv4GgAw&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg#safe=off&tbm=isch&q=ir+led+effects+on+digital+camera&spell=1&facrc=_&imgdii=_&imgrc=xIRi19iwEBxv_M%253A%3BwxkUqO9lMLcJYM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fupload.wikimedia.org%252Fwikipedia%252Fcommons%252F6%252F67%252FP1020168.JPG%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fen.wikipedia.org%252Fwiki%252FInfrared%3B2560%3B1920 Your next question is tougher to answer. Within the software that runs the system you can modify how much you have to move (its resolution). Just like the DPI settings for your mouse. I'm pretty sure if you were to make it as sensitive as possible you could spin your character's view quicker than you can see things on the screen. Like taking your mouse and wiggling it vigorously and the mouse cursor almost becoming invisible, if you know what I mean.
Yes! I have seen it work on Vista, 7, and 8.1. The computer I play it on is 64-bit Windows 7.
I wouldn't advise it. Since Microsoft servers do not support a lot of XP systems anymore. I suggest upgrading to Windows seven. I have Windows 7 Ultimate and a great video card. If you do this, make sure your power supply in your pc can handle a better video card. Otherwise, you can damage your system.
well an emulator is to mimick a console. I know controllers work. so I would assume it would work. but if not you can get it to work with a 3rd party software like joy2pad or something.
If it just said "PC" it will send you a physical copy of the game... If it said "PC Download" then you would be able to get it trough download...
nope...
Yes we can. Please order it and check our rate also
I am not sure Its a good game. I have Windows 7 Professional also new computer Alienware played older Computer.
NOP sadly in can only be booted from disc and the original servers from activision for blur doesn't work anymore, the onyl way to play online is with tunngle http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DP-ygfhSQA
The answer is yes, it works on mac. It gets recognized automatically system wide as a USB gamepad. Literally plug and play. Both controllers were recognized in sixtyforce too.
yes you can
Yes it does
I don't think it will but youcould probably use this n64 to GameCube adapter and them the GameCube to wii u if you really wanted. http://www.raphnet-tech.com/products/n64_to_wii/
Yes
Yeah you just have to calibrate it with your windows 7. Look it up on YouTube if you have to or google.
If you use Xpadder you can.
36 inches
Yes.
This is not meant for use with the Wii. Only PC/Mac. http://www.amazon.com/Classic-Nintendo-Wii-Gamecube-Game-Cube/dp/B007PVC30M This is the item you want for N64 to Wii.
Yep, and lasts more than a week. Best one I've found.
The cord is 5 feet 6 inches, I used a tape measure.
I can confirm that it works on windows 8, and if you use a program like joy to key you can very easily make it work with steam. My only complaint is that one of the buttons began sticking after only a few hours.
Yes
I've used 3 of them on various raspberry pi projects with 100% success. I would guess that if your android device has USB Host, you should be fine.
This can be accomplished with programs such as Xpadder, AutoHotKey, or EventGhost. You can do this with most any controller, though.
Yes it has the L and R bumpers on the top of the controller. I did a video review of this controller that people seem to like, you can watch it here: http://youtu.be/UgiI711zZiw
I run Ubuntu 12.04; it's been fine for ZSNES.
Yes but this isn't based on the controller, its based on whether or not the software you're using to play the game allows two players. If it does (and usually it should) there should be minimal issues.
it's plug-and-play, no cd included.
At least on the Xbox 360, not any way that I'm aware of. They do not ever use the "F" word and you will often hear them using other words purposefully instead of the actual curse word. But, they will say curse words every now and then. But, if you're worried about the foul language in the game, I wouldn't advise letting anyone young play this.
No you don't. Best game ever
Yes
The first one is rated M-Mature so I assume this one would be the same. The game involves shooting zombies so there is a lot of gore in it. Heads and limbs are blown off the zombies. I have seen in the options where you can turn down the gore, but of course I have never tried it. Its a fun game where you have to learn to work with teammates to survive. I'm not a mother so I really don't know what age I'd recommend, but if I had to I'd say... high school, maybe the middle school age if you turn down the gore.
Not as far as I know. I can't speak for the dlc however. Also don't trust me.
I m not sure. I know you can play two players co op offline
The description must have a typo; on our wii 1 = shoot 2 = jump. As a note, the 1 has a dual purpose; shoot and run
You just have to make sure ur wii has american system i think if it's british this would not work this is from my experience I'm not sure if it's true or not
You need to buy a DS or 3ds Mario game.
No it doesn't. You can only use the Wii remote. You can either have it turned on its side, or have the nunchuck hooked up to it.
I really don't know my grandson was 8 when I get it for him.
Nov. 2009
Yes, i have the Wii mini and it works
You can play all Wii games on the Wii U as long as you have the wii remote. You cannot play Wii games on the Wii U gamepad, though.
I purchased this game along with another for my son and we have had no problems whatsoever with either one.
You can play with just the remote

The balance board does all kinds of things besides your weight (horrors!). Some of the games are made to help your balance, as in you shift your weight to make them work such as skiing, or hula hooping, even making balls drop through levels or the step exercises (just like in the gym). The running/jogging things you don't need it for but I would suggest it because so many of the fun ones use it.
If you have a color TV or monitor
This video game works within the Wii console, it does not work within a computer system only within the Wii game console.
No. The fit meter is only an add on to measure daily activity which then adds to the Wii Fit U score.
Yes it does.that part is just like the regular wii fit. But the plus has so much more fun activities and is way better then just the reg.fit.
Yes
yes the plus has a few more yoga poses and strenth training as well as a few other balance games too. Both are good
Yes! Perfectly. NO problems.
Isn't that the European system???
A couple of the things you can, but most require the board to make sure you're doing exercise right, weight check. The only thing I do not use board for is the running. In my opinion, the game itself is too costly, since you won't be able to do most exercises, without the board. But your answer is, yes you can do w/o board.

05g? As far as i know, psp doesn't get updates anymore and all can have cfw (i have proC update cfw installed)
No just your standard psp games but this is just a straight download device so you have to download your games or cinvert your games to computer and then to the go. My opinion of this psp is its not bad its nice to not carry all those games. but it sucks downloading games cause it takes to long. hopes this helps
It uses a proprietary sony memory card called an "M2". It is also used by some sony ericson phones.
Yes
No OEM/Manufacturers packaging.
The psp 3000 is a great gift for your son
Yes, it comes with the charger. it also contains manuals. basically the psp is like new.
No u have to buy ur own
other than the free thirty day trial that is correct.
You can download it through the PSN and do not have to wait for the disks. I will caution you however that the PS3 version is not really very good due to its hardware limitations etc. It's playable, but tends to be very laggy in high traffic areas. I stuck it out until the PS4 version came out, and used that instead. If you don't have a PS4, you can still play well enough to justify buying the game for PS3 though. Hope that helps!
You have to buy the game new once it is opened and the code is used the disc is useless
Yes Zines, You have already answered your question. Although this game is so addictive, YOU CAN'T PLAY WITHOUT A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION BY ANY WAY, there's no offline game, even the main story needs a monthly fee. YES, it's a dumb. You pay only for a Blue ray disc with the game data and an online pass for 30 days of TRIAL, when those days ran out, a message like this appears "you have to pay a subscription in order to play". That's a shame...
Physical copy.
Contact the company. I have had that happen before.
You need to contact amazon and/or square about that. Mine was on the back of the book in the case.
It has mild blood, violence, very little language. It just BARELY scrapes up to mature. I have had this talk with a bunch of people wanting to get their child Reach. It should not be rated Mature, and the thousands and thousands of times I have played it I have never felt "disturbed" or like it was inappropriate for children. You DO do things like run aliens over, or jab a knife in their brainpan, but it is just comic violence. Like LEGO games; isn't it morbid to hit someone and have them explode into pieces? ;) Just saying, this game has violence but it is very mild. Many of the Halo games are not deserving of their Mature rating. Hope this helps you some!
Yes you can
Yes it can
no
Only if you want to go on line to play with it others. Other wise you can play anytime yourself
Yes it can
In short, no. Halo 1 & 2 were ported to the pc, but they stopped doing that after 2. All the other Halo games (Reach included) only work on the consoles they were made for. The only way to play Reach on the pc is to do some serious hacking, or use an illegal torrent to download a hacked copy. The one pictured here was specifically made for the xbox 360, so it will not work on a pc (again, not without some serious hacking).
No. At least, not for the campaign (story mode), which can be played locally by two persons. Matchmaking is the only part of the game where Xbox Live Gold is highly advisable. I'd recommend Internet connection with a base Live account (no gold) if you want to keep track of your records and achievements.
Depends on the kind of fun you want. Bungie did Reach so there is a lot of fun to be had where the characters are actually funny and the playability is great. Halo 4 (not Bungie) takes itself far more seriously little to no "fun" stuff, just an attempt to make the story more serious. Halo 4 has immensely better graphics and if you like thick plot and story and a solid multi-player then that's your game (co-op is completed in less than a few days so not worth it for just that). Reach was the pinnacle of Bungie's evolution of the game, a must-have for any Halo fan. I personally don't consider Halo 4 even part of the franchise, more of a spinoff because it's SO different.
Reach does not have John in it. It is a team of Spartan IIIs. You will be Noble 6. Fighting the covenant attacking Reach. The play is the same in that you kill as many covenant as possible while achieving your team's mission. I liked it better than Halo 4 because I enjoyed playing as part of a team of spartans. Not to say I did not like Halo 4. Also, you get to choose what your armor looks like. Hope this helps.
Yes
You will need another cable to connect it. I had to buy another one too!
Yes, it's an X-Box 360, that is what this is for.
Yes
Yeah, is a perfect gift.
i believe it does
No
Says on box it works with any Xbox 360 console. I can not tell you about the ELITE 120 GB. minimum 190MB storage required hope this helps some
It comes with a plug..my kids connected it to the xbox 360..I hope that helps.
About 6 feet will be nice to play with Kinect.
Yes & No - Yes if you are playing it WITH the 1.7version patch you get from Bethesda's website. This is to make it compatible with 4 core an more CPU/processors (game was built when 2 core's were common) an other things. Now for modding which I have done, I have no issues with Windows 7 nor should you with Windows 8 (I am aware of it's problems, why I stayed at W7 Pro). because there are mods & fixes for everything at NexusMods. Please remember to install game in folder other than Program Files because Windows UAC feature causes problems. For example C:Games/Fallout3. Also note that Windows Live no longer exists so you can not validate it nor do you have to. You essentially are buying this so not to get malware or viruses from pirated copies or you just do not want to wait forever to download it off steam. Took me 5 days to get it running good with over 50GB worth of mods. Great learning experience, awesome game, 10000X better than when I first played it.
Yes Rama, i can play it with steam.
Yes, I'm running 7.1.
I have windows 7 and the game is compatible with my system.
You should be able to do it. Makes sure it is the same type with the one you got. Sometime there is add on with the new one.
Yes, but remember to ask the Steam community if it crashes often.
It's not a code, it comes with 2 disc but I never got to play it. I tried endlessly to install it but I couldn't! ! Very frustrating to say the least. I have Windows 8 on a very nice computer. I tried just about every lead on how to install it but to no prevail. Lucky I have it on Xbox 360, this game is awesome but I wanted to play it on my computer for the conveyance of playing it anywhere. Good luck!!!!
I have the same game too. You have to make your computer compatible for it. There is ways to do this by google and search for compatible mode or use utube videos as well.
Windows 7 pro, Linux OS in "windows emulator mode", or gamble on Windows 10. If none of that works, then wait for it to be on sale on steam, I bought FA3 on disc an later again on steam because it runs a bit smoother since there is no disc spinning an they made it more multi-core processor friendly, same thing as the multi-core fix, just updated.
No
There's many different ways to tell real from fake. The obvious is the case: Pokemon Emerald is a transparent green, fakes may use a solid green; the Official Nintendo Seal will also be on the logo sticker, some fakes forget to put that on; another the nintendo logo on the cartridge (under the casing) which is visible by tilting the game or just taking the back off; the very sad way to figure out the game is a fake is having the save function just not work at all (note that Emerald does not need the internal battery to work to save the game. The internal battery just determines certain in game events and anyways that can be replaced). There isn't any way to tell if the game is fake or not until you have it in your hand (seeing as online sellers can use real images from anywhere and state they are theirs) and when purchasing it's purely based off of trust.
Pokemon Emerald has a similar plot to that of Ruby/Sapphire, however there are some key differences: In Ruby/Sapphire the main antagonist is either team aqua/magma but in Emerald you both are equally dubious, also there are different gym leaders and E4 members. So no they don't have the same plot.
if you order a gameboy cartridge like this game it will be able to work on the ds gameboy slot they are the same
It looks real to me
You can play it on the gameboy advance, gameboy advance SP, nintendo DS, or nintendo DS light
Yep, start a new game, new profile. :)
I would say yes. It's like walking on a treadmill. I get more exercise off this game than wii fit.
You should be able to use it. I just put the cd in and followed the instructions. It is a good program and fun.
Yrs, the game is terrific and addictive. My grandchildren and myself really love it.
No
Absolutely appropriate for children! G-rated and fun for kids and adults. Great program.
Depends on what method you are using. Are you using the dance pad, step or nunchuck? For instance, I use the nunchuck and wrap an ace bandage type of thing for the back around my thigh (it velcros) and just tuck the nunchuck into that. I find it the easiest. BUT, I have to have that nunchuck tucked in there at just the right angle to count the steps correctly. Also, make sure the sensor bar is at the best angle.
Yes you can. I use my Walk It Out in my WiiU every day.
You may have to use a different controller to see if that one is the problem. I had to switch controllers as one was broken.
I did not know "Walk it Out" was supposed to have mini games, so I look forward to hearing from someone who's played some.

Yes it will. That is what I have and it works fine.
I don't use wifi for the DS. There are TONS of games that you can play against the " computer " and/or single player games.
With the games, you play against the computer(device). And I believe that you can change the settings on certain games, so that you can play against other players and not the computer(device). I don't know if this helps you out at all.
WOW. I purchased this game for my nephew a while back. I believe this was for the regular DS game. It worked fine. I don't see a reason why it shouldn't work on yours. You can also ask the seller if it will work on your DSi XL. Hope I've been of some help.

Stuck Knob Solution here! Hello, I had the same problem and found the perfect solution online (for just $2.99): In order to fix this problem you just need a larger knob which provides the extra leverage needed to (effortlessly) turn the knob. The original knob should come off easily by wiggling and pulling at the same time. The knob is attached to a 1/4'' shaft so any larger knob that fits a 1/4'' shaft will do fine. I used one from radio shack (Model: 274-407), which was 1/4'' shaft and it also contained a micro screw that you can tighten to ensure a snug fit. This knob slightly covers the labels (ALT,VS IAS, etc) but because these values show up on the screen as you tune to them, it's no big deal for me. Btw, I attempted to contact Saitek for a solution and shocker! -No Response.
Its a toggle switch up an down only and not similar to actual flight flap system. I still prefer using m joystick lever for flaps
Yes, you must download the Saitek plugins from X-plane.org and put them in your plugins folder in X-plane. You may have to turn the plugins on.
You have to download a plug-in from X-plane.org. Install in plug-in folder. Activate the plug-in.
Provided the computer is powered on, my mini-screen displays a dull red glow. Once I start MS-FLTSIM X, a test follows and then it displays what it's supposed to.
I doubt there will be conflict between the two. I once had two controls for the flaps, one on the panel, one on the throttle quadrant. You'd just have two controls for one thing. Plus in Flight Sim it splits the different controllers into categories, so it may do that for your wheel.
Yes, just go to Saitek's web site and contact them.
Yes mine did but it was very easy. Install the disk and device with the disk. Go to www.saitek.com click on downloads on the top bar, click on software, then select the product Pro Flight Range from the drop down, then select the Pro Flight Multi Panel from the next drop down. Then select the type of OS 32 or 64. Finally select driver download and make sure you click save then you are ready to go. You can also get the Drivers for X Plane 9 and 10 here on the same site and page. IF you need to update more than just select make another selection on the same page.
Yes they work on the mac... I used them for X-Plane on a mac a couple of years back and they worked wonderfully... but please visit this thread...and use the link on the posts there for the plugin...you might have to use the plug in. http://forums.pilotedge.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=886 you will find the plugins here http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?app=downloads&showfile=14646 -cheers
Hello, As long as the latest Xplane drivers and plugins are installed prior to connecting the radio panel then yes it should work.
What's DCS?
It's a USB device that's used to control, and display information from, the in-game radio stack in Microsoft Flight Simulator (FS2004, FSX), or, through 3rd-party drivers available online, other flight simulator games such as X-Plane or Prepar3d. You can dial in any two of the following channels for your aircraft and adjust their frequencies: COM1, COM2, NAV1, NAV2, ADF, DME, or the Transponder Code (although I've had difficulty getting the transponder to work). Adjusting things on this panel while in-flight updates them on the in-game virtual radio stack and vice versa. Hope this helps.
No mate, they are USB devices, I run 6 of these on my flightsim with no problem at all
It will 99 percent work in win 8 I have x plane and u had to download a plugin but it works great
Hi, a couple of thoughts on this. I had the same thing happen when I went to a new PC. It was USB 3.0 and the Saiteks are 2.0. I solved this by plugging a USB 2.0 expansion port in. Problem gone. I have dual Saitek Yokes, Pedals, two radios and the BIP. Also, I have seen similar behavior with a Go Flight Autopilot. I finally used cleaner on the potentiometers. Caution, this will void any warranty you have left. Hope this helps
Yes. Use the xsaitekpanels plug-in available on the X plane.org site. I have had no problem switching the radio channels or the navigation channels. I haven't tried the ADF or DME function.
Yes just download the Saitek panels plugin and it will work for Mac/Win
I found this online: "First, remove the top of the announcer's table using A while next to the table. Then, with a finisher or signature icon, irish whip HHH on to the announcer's table and press Y." http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/960291-wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2010/53149039
no it does not have announcer table during match
Yes. This is the same cable I'm using for my mk1 genesis
Yes
RF switch from AV to coax will work.
Doesn't really matter, just know that this will fit ONLY the Model #1 Genesis... if you don't know if you have a model 1 or not, look it up on the internet or go to a game store and talk to someone over 30yo.
No
Sorry, this cable is for what is known as a 'Model 1' Genesis. You have a 'Model 2' Genesis. What you need is here (copy & paste the following link into your address bar): http://www.amazon.com/Sega-Genesis-Standard-Cable-Bulk-Packaging/dp/B002GCFI2K | Sega Genesis 2 & 3 Standard AV Cable
Hmmm im not rly sure, I javnt seen the cdx, I do know the outlet in the back was NOT at all the same as on the cord and its the sega genesis 1 as well. Look very closely at pictures of.this cord and see if the back matches perfectly, I swore this did but I was wrong
I use it on my pc, allowing me to go in to the calibration of the controller which allows me to insert the axis if needed. I don't have any experience with ps3 so I wouldn't be able to help out much there.
R/L 1 is linked to R/L 4 which is located where your middle fingers rest right underneath the controller (that is if you don't set them to be anything else) and I had set them to R/L 2, so R/L 1&4 and R/L 2 became swapped. I had trouble learning how to do it but it's all in the instruction book, just a little confusing to learn, plus it remembers it so next time you turn it on just activate the "swap" button (glows green on right) and it will have your saved swapped set. Btw the batteries don't last long on it, I would get a corded one.
Haven't found the driver for it.
Ours going to get recognized as "run and drive" from the get go. I had an xbox controller before this one do the drivers were still on my computer. No such luck with it being recognized a one.
This use 2 AAA batteries, yes you can use rechargeables ones to save money.
the triggers are very good and have lots of spring to them, I love this gamepad for my laptop when im on the road
Yes, it came with a charger. :]
Yeah, they come with a charger and stylus.
Yeah, ds/dsi games can be played on the 3ds, but they won't be able to be played using the 3D feature, only in 2D, only 3DS games will be able to play using the 3D feature. Hope this helps
Yes, but action replays for the ds won't. U have to get one specific for the 3ds, but normal ds games work just fine.
Yes it does its really nice
since it comes with one yes it kind of is, also it allows you to download more content and a place to save your pics and what not
Yes
The one I bought was for the American region.
To the best of my knowledge they can be
Excelente
No it does not, please dont listen to rusty, I have the game, and it doesnt have any sort of multiplayer at all. Not even minigames.
Yes the 3ds XL plays supermario 3d land :)
Yes it does.
No, they are two different games, however they play very similarly.
Not really, you can pay fine in 2d
A 19 year old will enjoy this game the amount of hours I really have no clue lotsof factors I was busy with college while playing this it took me a week to complete it its pretty fun if you enjoy other mario games a scale from 1-10 its 8 it makes you think a lot on how to pass certain stages and getting the ever so mighty three gold coins overall you will enjoy this game
If the question is: Is this is english version? Yes it is!
3ds is region locked. Meaning you have the buy the game that has a matching region with your 3ds
No
No. It works in the 3ds and the 2ds
No it does not, please dont listen to rusty, I have the game, and it doesnt have any sort of multiplayer at all. Not even minigames.

No don't buy from them.....
Yes
I bought a stylus at K Mart and since then I've seen them at Walmart and even Dollar Tree and my daughter-in-law bought one at Toys R Us I think. Julia
Yes. The only games you can't use are the 3d games.
The outside cover of this DSi is a bronze color.
yes and I recommend making sure it is off if a small child is playing. wifi and 3d both have external on/off switches.
Yes
Yes it can play every ds game
Yes I bought it for my 7 yr old nephew. He loves it
We cannot ship to hotels. Sorry.
It has an application available for download called swapnote.It is similiat but I'm not sure if it will communicate with older devices.
No, it's a 3DS not a NDS and only the latter one can play Pokemon yellow :(
Yes, it can connect to a wireless internet access. to play games, watch movies, etc.
The one I bought was American.
The newest 3DS console available is called The New 3DS XL.
Yes in fact the multiplayer mode in COD has always been one of the best features of the game. You do need a stable internet connection though. Hope this helps.
It is violent. A lot of shooting and killing people. Online can be very graphic and people are very profane. In my opinion, no, it's not acceptable for a 9 year old. If my son was 9, I wouldn't allow him to play it.
It will keep them very entertained but they may have more interest in guns
is there local multiplayer or do you need live.
Yes if you don't have online then you can play bots, there are plenty of YouTube videos showing.
You unlock everything by a point system that you gain slowly throughout the game. You have to save enough points to unlock each iteam that you want.
If you want to play online ,Yes u need xbox live , but if u just play campaign or single player than no u don't need xbox live
Yes
I mean there Is some difference other than the map packs u get a new weapon called the maverick that switches from assault rifle into a sniper rifle and the new map packs Bayview, Containment, Ignition, and Fog. plus the Michel Myers Easter egg just complete a field order and u might obtain it it's like the maniac kill streak but with an axe instead my opinion and rating 7.5 good! : A solid game that definitely has an audience. Might lack replay value, could be too short or there are some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun. Hope this helped! &#128515;
Yes the multiplayer is 2 player split screen and you can also play online multiplayer on one TV with 2 people split screen.
Yes. It had the offer code,but if you get it used,it its probably used already. There is also a rare special edition box set but it is VERy expensive .
I am not a seller. I bought a used game from Amazon. It came with a plastic case.
Hey. The main game is region free, so it should work. The DLC is usually region locked, but for this game the DLC is only for multiplayer. This is where i get my info that the game is region free: http://www.play-asia.com/uncharted-2-among-thieves-paOS-13-49-en-70-39ew.html
Mine were already redeemed because I bought it used. If you look up the actual dlc content, you'll see that you aren't missing all that much. It is likely that the codes expired even if the game is new...considering it is several years old now.
Yeah mine had a code to access all the bonus multi-player stuff because it was game of the year edition.
Pretty much... The one I received had an code to redeem for the add ons & it was invalid.
yes hard bots to play its straight
No it did not.
Yes it's the USA version.. The game is amazing!!
I'm not sure.
yes
No I don't believe there is but its not a very gory game when you kill guys they just lay like dolls for a while.
Is there online multiplayer? Yes, 4 v4.
Online is overall worth it. Maps are smaller but make for great head to head battles. Online doesnt lag. It may occasionally kick you out of a match for no reason but it only occurs once or twice every few days. Easy fix, just close the game and go back in. Overall, the online is good enough to have the game because of simple, yet really good loadouts and the maps. P.S.- A lotta people noob tube, so dont hate em, join em. Its more fun
I'm sure it's on a game card. Not sure about indian vita. Sorry.
Its ok but the controls are kind of needing to get use to
This game has absolutely no blood and very little violence (cartoon sword slashing and fighting of the sort) and it's full of puzzles in which you could cooperate with your child to solve. It's good to develop those puzzle-solving skills and strengthen your bonds at the same time.
The new game has updated visuals and small tasks such as location of items changing. Otherwise the game is mostly the same from the original. Having played the game cube version I still strongly recommend picking this up if you have a wii u as it's a blast with replay.ability
It comes with a club nintedo brochure and a paper that tells you how to access the electronic manual. The electronic manual can be accessed by pressing the home button while in-game and select the "?" symbol.
Both games are excellent. They are totally different kinds of games. If you are a solo player get zelda. If you like to play with friends get Smash. Also, although a very good game, zelda has low replay value compared to smash.
To quote the Zelda Wiki: "Exclusive to The Wind Waker HD, the Swift Sail is an upgrade to the Sail that enables the King of Red Lions to sail faster. Also, the Swift Sail automatically changes the direction of the wind to the boat's heading, thus making the King of Red Lions sail at full speed in all directions. This eliminates the need to play the Wind's Requiem when sailing. The Swift Sail is activated by pressing the A button while the normal sail is deployed, and can be changed back to the normal sail by pressing A again. The upgrade is found at the Auction House on Windfall island after the completion of Dragon Roost Cavern.[1]" http://zeldawiki.org/Sail#Swift_Sail
It's single player.
No it is a completely different game
Well if you havent played the game and you are a completionist at least 40 hours, if you are new to the game and you are just want to play it to finish from 16 to 20 hours.
It must have been upon release and or preorder. Because the one I ordered recently did not have a gold foil cover on it.

yes
yes
Xbox 360 games are not region free. There should be a PAL version available. However the online servers are no longer online, you can still play the offline single player.
Im pretty sure that you could.
Not 100% sure but I don't think so
Not even CLOSE!!!!
yes you can choice menu , audio language & subtitle all them in spanish
Just online
Not really sure about the exact dimensions. It is the same as any PS3 game or blu-ray. Hope that helps.
This one is a physical copy of the game, it can also be purchased from PSN Store digitally.
Yes
As long as you have a PS3 move camera it will work for any PS3 system.
It does work perfectly on the PS4. They didn't made a new one. It works on both.
Good
You can use this as well as a standard controller for Heavy Rain. It is totally up to you, they're compatible.
NO CHARGER
Yes
Yes
Wen you connect more then one pieces with the playstation, the color change automaticliy....
This motion is for use with the Playstation 3 or Playstation 4. A Playstation Eye camera is also required to play the Just Dance Games.
I am.
I'm American but as long as you can log into XBOX Live it should reach the regional servers in your area if not log onto XBOX Live and ask for a solution.
Yes it is
Of course! 1-2 local. 1-4 online. Many game modes and many achievements. Tons of fun!
Yes
I never got one that I am a sure, I only bought it for horde and campaign mode.
Multi-player online, but 2 players can play story line co-op.
No. English only
CECH-3001A, system software ver. 4.55. I couldn't find any firmware information sorry =(. But it's definitely a 1st generation slim. It has no "wi-fi" indicator in the front of the PS3. I'm very disappointed in this. The condition of it was unacceptable & horrible. Was very dirty & had noticeable dirt within the usb and back ports. I do not recommend buying from GoHastings.com ever!
No, PS2 backward compatibility was dropped after the software capability of the 80GB fat model. Hardware compatibility was only in the original 20 and 60 GB fat models.
If I was you I would contact the seller. If you are buying a used I team then it could have been human error on their end. If it is there fault, and they refuse to correct there mistake I would contact Amazon, and they will muscle the seller or make their life miserable for you. Amazon has an amazing customer service team.
No
It comes with an AV and Power cable but not controller
Do you mean you can play online with people with later PS3 models, or PS4 users?
I apologize but I'm not sure exactly what your question is. Please give a little more detail so I may properly give you any answer to any questions you may have. Thank you
It mite but the one I got said it came with a controller but it didn't and not only that but the disk drive didn't even work so now I have to use it for parts
Yes
Yes but no controller
The main game is single player. However there are special stages that can be played two player outside the main game. These two player stages are unlocked in single player, and consist of side scrolling platforming that gets challenging fast.
1 player story mode 2 player arcade mode ( only after halfway beaten first world ) :O
As far as I know yes
The regular wii remote is fine, the classic remote works also and is more comfortable in your hands.
It's really fun. One of the most beautiful games on the Wii.
Yes
You can skip them.
I do not know what a WII mini - but we do not have wi fi connected to ours
Yes

Wii-mote, Classic Controller, Gamecube, and Wii-mote nunchuk.
The key from the cd box is all you need for founders status. When entering the key remember to enter it backwards as well for an additional mount.
That it does. Additionally, you can enter the code backwards to get some additional goodies after you register your copy.
you have to have internet to play this game. it's like WoW without the fee
You need a physical copy
This indeed has the code for the "Founder" status that gives 8 character slots, full bank tab, a mout for each character. But beware as it's the code for the NA version for TERA enmasse, so if you want to code for enmasse get it, but if ur looking for the EUropean version it's not this one.
Account wide
You should have an En Mass account for Tera. Go there , log in, click the "enter code" button on the right side of your account overview page. Enter and submit code.
US version only
If the question is whether the NA version is the same as the EU version, the answer is yes....it is just a different set of servers and of course a different set of players. I have played on both and it is the same ga.e.
Yes updates and patches are downloaded once you create an account and log in. Expect at least a few hours of patching on your first login since there have been quite a few big updates since the original release.
I'd say yes, especially if you are a fan of the series. It's pretty much on par with Gears 3 as far as graphics game play etc. I too only purchased it for the campaign mode. One thing judgement has is; you'll come to a variety of different types of side/bonus missions that are optional during the campaign. You'll know when you come to them, because there will be a red gears emblem on the wall, and they aren't hard to find. Walk up to it and you can either accept or deny if you want to play it. It's kinda like horde mode on online. You and the crew have to face usually two waves of various types of enemies. So it's kind of like a run and gun type of affair. You'll earn stars, badges, etc for completing/doing various things when playing them. So that adds to the campaign as well. I am very pleased with my purchase. I've only completed the first few chapters; because I bought 7 other games at the time. So I have a lot of love to spread around, lol. Another recommendation that I have for you is Tomb Raider if you haven't played it already. That's where most of my gaming time is spent. It's a very good game, and I highly recommend it. I'm playing it on the ps3 however. I would definitely recommend Gears judgment as well since you are a fan of the series. I noticed the other answers were short, so I tried to provide additional information to help you out with your decision. Hope this helps with determining whether you purchase it or not. You won't be disappointed though...
No sorry
Not necessarily. For this game, as long as you have the room for saving the content, then it'll play smoothly for you. :]
Yes. Good story line. Kicks butt as much as others.
Yes
If you would like to play private matches you can, however if you are looking to play a game mode like war zone that is like the previous Warzone & other modes from the past games you are kind of out of luck as they have changed the mechanics of the game so much that you do not even get down anymore. To sum it up you will not have an opportunity to experience the type of game playing you are you still from any of the three previous titles.
Yes it does. Trust me.
Yes
Yes
No this only works on a pc or console
The cords are not 15 feet. I would say they are closer to 10
This particular model is NOT a wireless headset
Just did it to mine. Yes. Beautiful sound.
Head set port.
Yes it has one take your headset and go about half way down the cord and there is a little box it will have a red or green light on it if it's green the Mic is on and if the light is red it should be off its easy.
Yes they work on Mac.
12 foot cable length and 3.5 mm plug for line input. Here you go. Hope it helps
Yes, you can also hear the clicking of guns as they are being reloaded.
I bought this game near the release date for full price. I don't regret paying what I did and now that it's much cheaper I wouldn't pass it up. :)
No. It is only 1 player.
Yes. The story in the 3DS game is a prequel to the Wii U game.
No, just the new wii u system.
If you could it would ruin the game. This game, better than any other I've played, takes full advantage of the game pad. You would not want to play this with the pro controller if you could. I don't think it is possible anyway.
Like any of the LEGO games you can go back and get 100% completion. There is a lot of replay value here as going back to finish the game out and find all the extra bricks, characters, cars etc. is what makes it more enjoyable after the fact. I found the story to be fantastic and obviously from my review, I rate this game very highly.
No... unfortunately not. Gamepad is used as a device by your character in the game
Absolutely! It is a super fun, appropriate for all ages game.
It is the ultimate free roam. Better than any other Lego game. It is the ultimate a d aweso.email 1 player adveture! My most desired sequel, and I never even liked Lego games before this. Buy it and enjoy!
It auto saves. If you're in the world, you'll just start back at the police station. There are checkpoints in all the missions.

all Move products will work with both PS3 AND PS4
The Motion controller is more or less the PS3's equivalent to a Wii Remote since it's the main peripheral aside from the Playstation Eye that's required for all PSMove games. That makes the Navigation Controller the PS3's Nunchuck since it's a largely optional side-peripheral that's only used in conjunction with the motion controller/remote for movement (Notably in Resistance and Killzone 3's PSMove modes) or additional off-hand motions (ex. pulling the bowstring in Sports Champions' Archery or as the shield in Gladiator Combat) in most games.
Yes the stick functions as a button as well.
I know you can plug them into the usb and pc will detect and charge but if there is anything that I know of that may help is the controller software called motionjoy. Best of luck. Will tell you I am not positive that this will solve your problem but a decent place to start.
No I'm sorry it's only for play station 3
Excellet product
No
If you are the only one playing, one is enough. It all depends on the number of possible people playing. We're a family of 3, so we bought 3.
All my controllers are wireless and it is wise to buy the set to the move controllers. The numb chuck is also a must have because you need it to use with bow and arrows, and some guns or riffles

A little extra clarification for the only other answer: the original Final Fantasy XIV did not do well critically and was basically scrapped/pulled offline. The game was given to a new development team for improvements and re-released under the title "Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn" in 2013. I do not know for sure that this game does not "work" anymore or that it won't automatically upgrade to A Realm Reborn, but if you are considering buying it then it's probably a good idea to purchase Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn to be safe. Also for potential buyers: please note that A Realm Reborn is NOT an expansion--you do not need to buy this in order to play A Realm Reborn.
You should be able to upgrade for free to ARR. However, in order to avoid any oddities, since you wouldn't have an existing account, simply purchase the FFXIV: ARR for convenience.
One disk, but, good luck getting help activating the game. Square Enix is really bad with their customer Support. I've had this game for over a year and still can not get it activated.
think the goggles were an item you had to quest or so. All I can find out is if you had them in 1.0 it carries over into ARR. Does it just give them to you for buying the game, the answer is as far as I can see. No. The goggles themselves are actually a EU 1.0 Preorder bonus. http://xivdb.com/?item/2632/Garlond-Goggles
Yes it is a NEW game designed for modern computers and works fine on XP, and later versions of windows. This is NOT one of the older Final Fantasy titles. It is an online MMO that uses modern technology.
Hello, and I have played Final Fantasy XIV now for over nine months, and have two characters up to level 50, and it is superb in terms of graphics. It will soar with your system and you will be amazed at how well it is designed and how beautiful it all is. You will be able to use the highest settings, the system is so well balanced that with hundreds of thousands of players spread out over scores of servers, it has no lag at all. Enjoy.
It states that the base game is required to play this expansion pack, so you must buy Wings of Liberty to be able to play Heart of the Swarm.
Yes, very well!
You need the activation code from the disk.
It really depends on if he also plays Diablo 3 or World of Warcraft. Collectors editions come with bonuses for all 3 of those games. For example, this one would give his D3 characters special wings & also an in-game pet for WoW.
I use a Mac Mini i5 2.5GHz with 8GB RAM. The game plays great for me, though I've only ran it on low settings. Out of all Blizzard games, SC2 plays the smoothest on my Mac. It should play fine on your machine, but recommended RAM is 4GB (2GB minimum). I'd go to at least the 4GB if you haven't already.
Sorry :/ just the box with the game inside
Only if it's never been opened....you pretty much need to buy it new.
Yes it does, though I wouldn't recommend trying to run the graphics on Ultra/Extreme on anything with a less than 2.6Ghz processor same as Wings of Liberty. However you can still run graphic on High you might be able to get away with Ultra if your Graphics card is good enough.
Depends on what your goal is. If you're just playing through the game normally, it could take a couple/few hours. 100% completion is a different story...
It's most likely because Nintendo is no longer having new copies of this game printed. Once a game goes out of print, it's value as a new, sealed copy tends to increase.
probably 5 star
I haven't tried it as single player but it is an option. I believe it would be fine as single player. Some of my partners were so lame I might as well have been playing alone.
No, it can only be played on the Wii U
No you can't use the classic controller with this. But you can with Mario Kart 8.
You can play one player with it, but to play four players you need controllers. You can still use the gamepad as a fifth player but cannot use any characters in game.
In my opinion super mario 3d world is superior but this game is still a pretty fun game, especially when playing with others.
yes you can, the only combination isnt available is using two gampads
You can use any mix of gamepad, wiimote, and WiiU pro.

It's got everything u need
No, that's for the xbox360 n ps3, black Ops 1 & 2
No standard vita with the game
Not really, it has some miliraries, and also eauropean
No, I tried it and it didn't work
I'm not familiar with their the Logitech gaming framework. But with the set point driver installed you can customize an unlimited amount of profiles saved on your computer and the profile will be loaded for whichever program has focus. if the program does not have a profile the general profile is used. this all happens on the fly behind the scenes.
it has programmable buttons which I assume could be used for that....but I'm not 100% certain.
G500 without the Weight Cartridge tray is 161 g (5.68 ounce) and with the Weight Cartridge tray empty is 164 g (5.78 ounce). G500 technical specs: http://logitech-en-amr.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/14191
Hi, I only saw your reply today hence the late reply. Maybe it's just me but the G500 is too bulky and the build quality is lower than the G5 in my opinion, for example when you click the mouse button it feels slightly loose on the G500. In my opinion, the G500 is not the mouse to upgrade to. I'm not sure which mouse to go to tbh. Right now I using the G5 again and the G500 is in the drawer.
I haven't used the G400 but judging by the pictures, they look to be the same size. Since the mouse is curvy, I measured the length and width at the longest and widest points on the base of the mouse: 12 cm by 7 cm
I don't feel it's all that loud but if you are gaming and repeatedly mashing the mouse button hard and fast in a completely silent house I am sure that it could disrupt someone from sleep but I think most mice would do that. This has been my all time fave mouse I have bought 4 of them and been the most happy with both the shape and the way you can weight it to be the right feel for you.
The cable is 2 meters (6.6 ft) long, and is braided. It looks nice.
According to Logitech's own website, they completely support your mouse on the Windows 8 platform (source: http://logitech-en-amr.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/32425#Mice) You would program your mouse's macro buttons using the 'Mouse and Keyboard Settings' program that comes with the Logitech drivers package. The program may also be called and titled, 'Logitech SetPoint'.
The only way to do it is to set a macro and just set to a key on your keyboard and set the action to that key in game. Windows doesn't seem to recognize the button.
I only used my KVM with my MX518, and that worked fine. I can't say I ever used a KVM with my G500 though(left click switch went bad in under 1 year btw, I just bought the G700). I suspect the KVM switch would not effect the standard functionality. Any lack of operation would probably be more specific to the KVM's quality or compatibility with the mouse due to voltage or signal loss through the KVM.
Yes
I'm not sure if it work with OS X Lion but I can test it out for you. I know for sure it works for OS X Snow Leopard because that is what I'm using it with. I have OS X Lion on my iMac but never tried playing it on it. I can give it a go a little later on today and get back to you. I will edit this answer once I give it a try.
Yes! It works perfectly!!! And the cord is a good length. I need to get a second one so I can play head to head with people
I don't know I use it on windows 7 and snes9x is the emulator I use it works perfectly on that
Nope, but works perfect in the 4 directional configuration. No complains about it.
Your emulator should have an input mapping feature that you can use to calibrate towards.
This controller is pretty much a plug n play controller, depending on what you want it for.. If you're gonna use it for a SNES or NES emulator, it will work perfectly as it's just to plug in, set controls and you're done, just like a regular gamepad. I use Windows 7 myself, but as it's plug n play, it will most probably work for Windows 8 OS too.
No. It doesn't work at all. Doesn't ship with a driver, windows 7 and 8 cannot find a driver, and i couldn't find one on google that would work. It's nothing but a paperweight.
Yes
If there is a button setup in the game, then maybe. I use it with an emulator. So not sure.
The laser and the battery life, most importantly, the battery life. The old model lasted a couple hours tops.
No its not. That is the 2013 model. They arent selling them on amazon yet. This is the older model.
Blue
Yes, this mouse is ambidextrous. Both sides of the mouse are a mirror image across the central axis. Be warned that it's hard to click the side buttons with your pinky. Well, it's easy to click them, but hard to click them on purpose.
Yeah, the mouse is completely symmetrical and has two buttons on each side, the built in software should let you switch it over depending on your preference
Sorry for the late response, I had to wait for my son to answer this. He believes it should, but you might need to google for more information. He uses as a bluetooth and wired and says it is an excellent mouse for gaming and photo shop, etc. Very responsive, no lagging. Thank you
NO! It's for BlueTooth equipped devices.
I cannot speak for the brand new model, but the one pictured here does have 'notched' scroll wheel. It is very responsive.
?????
Scrabble Plus works perfectly on Windows 7-64 bit.
Yes, it does.
No. I'm in my twenties and wear glasses and I found it too small for my taste.
It works on my desktop running window 7, so I assume it would work on version 8. Try it it's cheap enough.
No, I never played online. I'm very frustrated when I've played Scrabble Plus to the extent that I hardly play anymore. The game allows your opponent to use illegal Scrabble words which you have no way of challenging. I've gotten to the point when this happens, I quit the game. I love the game and I like to play by the rules.
No, you can load it onto your computer and then remove the disk.
No
I don't know. I really don't much care for the game. The graphics are bad and the playing levels aren't what I had hoped.
Yes.... I have it on my computer
Yes
Yes
It contains all three versions. The original, warchiefs and asian dynasties. The same if you bought all three seperately. Nothing added and nothing removed when combining the three. There is a campain story that flows through all three but Asian Dynasties is the best with the more options and the acrive online multiplayer scene. There you can play with friends or on your own against computers, against other people or custom maps such as free for all.
I already had one from my cd pack was just missing a couple CDs
yes i am positive i bought it. u have 0 worries.
It does work on windows 8. No issues
Includes I, II, and III
I don`t know for sure but I think so.
Label on mine says it was made in Europe. Below that it indicates the UK.
Your question is a little incomplete, actual creation of the game? Or the missions within the game?
absolutely - you don't need an Internet connection
Yup! And they are in great condition :) they were still I those cases and fit in the wii slots just like it says
Yes, but buyer beware, the left joy sick rubber WILL come off after useing for a while. I play ssbb and they only lasted a month.
yes
I received two controllers. They were in two separate packages as seen on the picture.
If you have a Wii U, then the console doesn't have slots for gamecube controllers. However, Nintendo recently came out with an adaptor that you could pick up at your local gamestop or toys'r'us. If you have a regular Wii, then the slots are on the top of the console behind a flap.
unbrand
this is the 3rd party made controller for gamecube games.
Yeah
You can't control the Wii menu with a GameCube controller, it has to be a Wii remote
Yes, not bad for moderate use.

Hi, I do not have a PS4 but from what I've read on the internet there are compatibility issues of PS3 remote with the PS4, so this may not work on PS4. You could email the manufacturer at -pcsupport@smkusa.com - to get a specific reply. Hope this helps.
If you can't find a code after doing a code search, use the Learning feature to program the remote to the box.
No
Yea u can record the buttons from tha remote u got from with your box http://youtu.be/ULQTU2RAQOY
I'm sure it could, as long as the remote learns the signal from the Roku remote.
Does not require your original TV remote unless you need to program specific buttons to your universal remote.
Yes
I don't think so but don't quote me
Yes
Line of sight for rf devices but bluetooth for ps3 connection goes through the wall.
No! It does not fill the screen, and they make it as difficult Each time you want to play, that to go Thur it all , it's not worth it. From now on I will only buy pop cap games!
I'm running it on Windows 7 - But the jewel case DOES list Windows XP (and not Windows 7 - imagine that) - So I assume it will run on your XP machine just fine.
I did not have to enter a number when I loaded the disc (downloaded it in December).
Yes. I got it to install on my 8.1 and it seems to be working just fine. Hope you find that helpful.
Sorry, but I don't have windows 8.
Yes
yes. My system is 64-bit windows 7 and it works very well.
It hooks to the back of your xbox 360 only
I purchased that cooling fan for my Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 Edition 320GB XBox 360, and it did not fit
Its not this one. try any of the black exterior fan styles. There was this really cool one I was looking at before I sold mine. Nyko Intercooler STS for Xbox 360
no and it only fits the old white Xbox, with the square looking plug
no the slim has got a built in cooling fan in it.thank you.
that really depends on just how it might have broken. if it simply " died", you might have a serious short in which it isnt repairable at all ( most likely given the design ). i do have this, have it on my old xbox, so i havent had an issue with it. if possible to open it up, you might have a short in a wire leading into the unit, or from the power source inlet leading to the fans. without having tried to repair, i can only guess. being three fans, if it all died, i would think that a wire coming from the power inlet into the unit is at fault. sorry, hard to diagnose without actually working on the unit, maybe someone else can help more.
Approx 8 inches by 8 inches, it will definitely fit your 3ds xl and then some. Inside the bag is an inner pouch that will fit your 3ds xl vertically, there is a detachable Velcro divider inside which you can remove to fit you 3ds xl horizontally, the additional space is supposed to be for a car charger. Either way there is plenty of room for your 3dsxl.
Yes
I'm not sure. My son has used it for his DSi and his 3DS, so I'm thinking yes, but can't promise.
I bought the blue/teal one. It does look like the black one but I do not know if it is like the pink one or not.
The case I purchased did not come with Mario on it.
unknown, sorry Ms Seal, purchased as gift & sent from Amazon
This does not go into the xbox's HDMI port at all. It goes into the proprietary A/V out plug.
Yes
I'm not sure I understand he question but to give you an answer this cable is used for xbox only. You connect one end to the xbox and the other end to your sound system. Hope this answer your question.
Yes I used it for my older turtle beach headset. And used the hdmi for picture and sound on my tv.
this works only for an xbox 360 that has a HDMI port for graphics, and an open slot for audio into which you need to plug in headphones, but is only that trapezoidal shape so you can't sync your headphones up without this adapter. There were some transitional models with this issue. If you don't have a trapezoidal hole in the back of your xbox, OR you aren't needing miked headphones, then you don't need this.
It is specific to only the 360. It works great, I am using it right now.
This goes to an Xbox 360 Slim. If look on this page (http://hdfanatic.com/2010/07/08/xbox-360-250gb/) there is a picture of the back of the Slim. The fat end goes in the A/V Port. I hope this helps.
Yes
It's like 6 inches approximately. Sorry man.
Im not sure about the turtle beaches, it worked for my after glow. I think it should work on the beaches too.
Razer has a free downloadable program called Razer Synapse that allows configuration of the mouse, Including the lights. The Wheel light and logo light can be toggled off individually. There's also an option to toggle all lighting to off when system displays are turned off
It is decently sized. My hands are large and it feels comfortable.
yeah it is, it matches the blue lights on my keyboard very well!
No
I'm not sure
Yes
The mouse has a 2 year warranty. http://www.razerzone.com/warranty scroll down to see the chart.
It's a right handed design, it's not confortable to use with your left hand, the shape of the mouse and the button placement would make it very odd. Razer has some ambidextrous options
Yup shouldn't have any issues.
Think of it as about the same size of the average Microsoft/Dell mouse you would get with a store-bought desktop computer, with a little bit more height (very little difference). I'd call it midsize, personally.
well, of course, many popular YouTubers play this game, such as: PewdiePie,jacksepticeye,Markiplierm,TheGamingLemon, and many more YouTubers.
No, there's really no story to the Skate series, just better gameplay and graphics. I'd say it would be great for you to skip the first two games and decide on Skate 3 instead. It's a great game, and definitely better than the other games!
There is no difference.
Skate 2?
Why is this game rated "T" for Teen? I think it's because there's minor swearing with words like 'hell' and 'damn'. There's also mild violence, crude humor, drug references from time to time, and suggestive themes. (I got those off the back of game where it says what you can expect to see in the game.) Hope this helps! :)
I think its ok.
Yes
Both
There is no story line to follow. Skate 3 has better graphics and more detail. My advice--spend your $40 on Skate 3.
No it's not mechanical, just a regular gaming keyboard but ive used it for almost 2 years and its still going strong for me in ways similar to that of a mechanical keyboard
I've had my keyboard for probably about a year and I have not noticed any of the keys showing wear. I use it daily.
Yes they can. They can also be programmed as a "toggle" which means the key will continue to be sent without any action on your part until you toggle it off by pressing it again.
Unfortunately no, I was pretty disappointed.
The volume control calls the system volume of the default output, not the active application.
Yes
It's at least 4. 5 may be pushing the limits.
There seem to be some compatability issues with Windows 8. Firstly, make sure you are using the correct software (32, 64 bit); it is available for download from Logitech's website. 32 bit is included on a CD with the keyboard. Make sure to completely uninstall the software to ensure a clean install from the manufacturers website.
Usually. In my case I didn't get one because it was used, but if you get it new it should come with a removable palm rest.
Yes it is. What isn't made in China lol.
Yes
They aren't very long. We have to sit on the floor to play or pull a chair close to the game system.
Not to sure. U might have to get a rca to hdmi converter if the picture is blurred or bounces.
i haven't noticed any noticeable delay.this system is very glitchy, keep in mind that the games have age as well. this system is cool but very, very poor quality.
Yes it is portable . Take it right back where you bought it from .if its like mine a piece of junk.worked literally one time . Sitting in my shed now can't get money back don't have the heart to throw away.
To the tv
No it does not bot there is a version of this console that does it's the snes retro.
Ours works perfectly.
I have Mario bros the first 1 and the 2nd and the 3rd. Along with duck hunt and Dr mario. They all play great. I don't know about being able to use the original game controllers. The ones that come with the system are great.
Hello, You need the cartidges to play. It does not come with preloaded games.
Viva Media
You have to go to the manufacturer's website, and download a patch. Mine worked fine after that.
I haven't tried it yet. I just got it...by the end of the day I can let you know :)
It should work with double deluxe, so should your old copy of pets. I'm not sure why your original copy of pets didn't work tbh. If you have further questions or need assistance from some real Sim experts try modthesims.info They have faqs and forums where you can get answers about your Sims games.
Yes
No you have to buy the Mac version of the game
Yes, it plays just fine on a Mac.
NO!!!!! None of these games have the same system connection to play on a Windows 8,laptop or PC. I have tried and had to send the games back.
Just 1
It comes with only one battery.
These are intended for use with Nyko's dual charger which does not require removing the batteries from the controllers to charge them. You just set the controller directly on the charger. They also work just fine with charge and play cables so it's a pretty safe assumption that they will work with the PDP/Energizer charger, too, since it connects to the same port. They will also work with any standalone charger that requires the battery to be removed from the controller. I've been using them for years and they have held up very well.
This is a rechargable battery. You will either need an Xbox 360 recharge base, or a play-and-charge kit to recharge the battery; both sold seperately.
Yes, I use mine and they charge fine but I yhink they take a little longer.
Yes
Yes and it works well. You hook it to the regular wiimote instead of a nunchuck. It seemed weird but i just set the wiimote in my lap or on the table beside me.
I can say mine did and I have a couple of their games to include mario party's
No, u have to connect it to the wii remote
Yes I does and your better off with it than the wiimote
Some
Yes, there are. For example, Xenoblade Chronicles.
The Wii Classic Controller Pro is mostly for Virtual Console games, and the GameCube controllers are only for GameCube games being played on the Wii.
No
No, it only works for the Wii...
No
No the card doesn't expire until you enter the code then it is like a normal membership after a year is up then you need a new one and they are stackable so you could buy it now and save it till the last day of your membership then add it and it would combine them
Here's my hunch: 1. Microsoft doesn't want any online codes being sold for much cheaper than they're selling them, so they maintain pretty strict control over the price (i.e. it's the same everywhere). 2. When retailers sell the physical cards, they typically sell it for the card face value. Since they have inventory and distribution costs for this and still want to make a profit off of the sales, Microsoft still has to sell the cards to retailers at a lower price, say $20 less. 3. Amazon or its vendors get a similar deal as brick-and-mortar retailers on these cards, but they have lower costs than brick-and-mortar stores. So they can afford to sell these cards at a lower price than face value, and it ends up being lower price than the online codes. The economic incentives are all wrong here, and sadly until Microsoft and other vendors properly take this into account, there will continue to be wasteful distribution of physical cards when selling an electronic code is better for everyone.
You are correct you would have a 2 year subscription. You can pre-load a total of 3 years.
Online game code just gives you the code rather then shipping you the physical card, so if you want to play right now rather then wait 3 days or more then do that.
It's possible, but then again, I've entered a code before my membership ended and it still went through. Then it automatically renewed the next day. I wouldn't know for sure though. There's a very slim chance that the code you received is invalid and the only way to find out for sure is to call Xbox Live Support or go on the website.
You can have them share an account. Only thing is that you can't have them both signed in at the same time, so if they wanted to do 2 player online then it would be better to have 2 online accounts
I don't see Venezuela listed on the XBox site, as one which is able to use live. However, a google search does show members stating they have access to it. I would check with your friend and ask if he's been able to use it in the past, before assuming it'll work. Although, if it won't work for him, you could always add it to your own account....so all is not lost. http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/countries
I do not believe that Uruguay is a supported country. You could have an account in a supported region however and use the code. Hope that helps!

If you have one of the original white WII unit, this is the correct DVD player for you. You will need the special hex like tool. It is not a Phillips head.
Yes, it will play gamecube games. It will play anything the original drive would.
No
I'd have to say no on this one. This is for the regular "Wii" units. The "Wii U" is Nintendo's next gen system. Other than the compatibility issues the form factor of the "Wii U" is different from the "Wii".
We don't have the metroid trilogy, however it worked as expected with Smash Bros Brawl. So far it has read everything we threw at it that is supposed to play on the wii.
It's compatible with all models. This drive is capable of reading the medium but there is no player. Wii does not include DVD playback software. You can only play video DVDs on a modded unit.
No, the kids have told me everything was still the same.
This is the complete drive. You simply swap the old one out with this one. All drive components are included.
The drive will act exactly as the previous one did no new capabilities that I know of. This is to replace a burned out drive in a nintendo Wii.
I cannot say for sure whether it will our not, but I will tell you that the drive I got only worked for about a month before it went out.
There are two possible cards from playstation. From what you describe the ones you mention are both referring to the same thing. You enter the codes and the funds appear in the Playstation online store that you access from the system, or through computer. There is another type if card that specifically refers to playstation Plus membership. I don't know what variations there are but they could be 1 month, 3 months, or one year. But those would specifically mention that they are for the membership. They could extend your prepaid membership if you got one, but won't add cash to the account. In this case the picture shows $10 as the cash value, so that should be the same. As long as it mentions Playstation.
Some people add there fees but others are just ridiculous
I don't have a PS4 yet, but the credit is for the network account not an specific console so it should be perfectly usable through a PS4.
No, you buy the card
i haven't used it for ps4 but it might work
no

Yes and straight away without downloading any additional software. Just plug into USB and u are good to go !! You would have basic left and right clicks and scroll wheel. To click the scroll as a third button u will have to download additional software(same as for Win 7 PC). Using it myself on OSX Mountain Lion and Win 7 PC.
It's going to be small for your hand if you are a 'palmer'. If you're a 'claw' or 'finger tip' gripper it might not be much of an issue.

Remember its just a entry gamers mouse not a high tech gaming mouse.
No, the buttons make a clicking sound
The mouse has a glossy finish, so is the mirror version, although is not indicated in the product name.
It maybe a bit louder than most common mouses honestly.
ofcourse
Its the regular version.
Fairly light mate. This mouse is cheap and durable. This mouse is not heavy like other gaming mouse.
I can confirm it works with both Windows 8 and 8.1.
I use it with the newest version, OS X 10.9.2, and it works great. Plug and play right out of the box.
I use it with Jnes, but I think it would work with many.
Absolutely, I do this all the time. You just have to set up player 1 and 2 for each side...button wise. Sometimes changing the usb ports jacks up the settings but most of the time, they just work.
It registers in Windows as a USB Gamepad - so it can be used for any PC game... you may just need to open the game's options and create custom mappings for the game controls to whatever gamepad input you want.
You have to allocate the buttons on the controller with Nestopia. This is what you do: Options --&gt; input. Select "Pad 1" and allocate the movements. Push "down" for down, "select" for select etc. Hope this works.
Not sure about whether or not its compatible with chrome OS but I tried on mac OS X (latest version) as well as ASUS ( older windows probably 7) and couldn't get it to do anything. Also, I referred to a few sites online and obviously I was not alone with this problem, yet, I found no sure proof solution. I'm sorry this is not a definitive answer to your question but I felt you might want the warning. Note that the Q&A section for this product said it would work for these OS. Hopefully if you choose to purchase this product you will not have the same dilemmas as I.
You will have to remap the settings in the Emulator as it reads it as joystick buttons.
GBA has L/R shoulder buttons. So an SNES controller would be better.
NES: NINTENDO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM which was a 8 bit system, and came out in 1985 in North America. Here is a small list of games from that system: The Legend of Zelda, The Legend of Zelda II: Links Adventure, Mega Man, Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario Bros. 3, Blades of Steel, Dr. Mario, Tetris, Bubble Bobble, Double Dragon, Battle Toads, Duck Tales, Excitebike, Final Fantasy, Galaga, Gauntlet, Golf, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Ninja Gaiden, Little Nimo: The Dream Master, RBI Baseball and may more. These are a few that I played with my friends as a kid.
The description must have a typo; on our wii 1 = shoot 2 = jump. As a note, the 1 has a dual purpose; shoot and run
You just have to make sure ur wii has american system i think if it's british this would not work this is from my experience I'm not sure if it's true or not
You need to buy a DS or 3ds Mario game.
No it doesn't. You can only use the Wii remote. You can either have it turned on its side, or have the nunchuck hooked up to it.
I really don't know my grandson was 8 when I get it for him.
Nov. 2009
Yes, i have the Wii mini and it works
You can play all Wii games on the Wii U as long as you have the wii remote. You cannot play Wii games on the Wii U gamepad, though.
I purchased this game along with another for my son and we have had no problems whatsoever with either one.
You can play with just the remote

You should be able too. The Gold Edition is the same game, its just has DLC content with it.
Only the subtitles. The language is only English.
It depends where you buy it, and if its new/used. Though mines is a used game, it came with the manual booklet. You should be able to find out by the seller's description. I believe its the standard gold edition
Yes you can
Yes, what it has is the subtitles in spanish
You don't need to download anything, it's all there you just have to beat the game a few times to find the stuff, and Gold has way more stuff then the first released version of the game.
Can you be more Pacific
Electrical outlet, yes. This unit comes with a small amp box that requires you to plug in power. There are two additional wires, one TosLink optical cable to go to the back of the xbox360, and then the actual wire to the headphones. The headphones can be disconnected from the amp box, and adapter wire put on the end of the headphone wire, and you can plug them into your PC via the normal 1/8 inch headphone/microphone jacks. Older xbox 360's with the removable HD have the optical output on the big plug that delivers video and sound out to your tv. Newer xbox 360's have the optical out on the back of the box itself instead of on the wire adapter. On our old xbox 360's, since we are using HDMI now, we bought $7 adapters that plug into the back of the xbox and have the optical TosLink on the end of them.
It will not work on my PC it has a loud buzzing sound that is constant no matter what USB cable I use, But it works like a champ on my PS3.
It should work whitout any adapters. I use mine on the 360 but the box says it works with pc
Yes
Yes
Shouldn't be any issue getting it to work with the 1...I use my version on ps3/4 and the Xbox 1...no special setups

You need to check with a specific seller. Some sellers mention if an item is complete with case and manual or tell you that it is "cartridge only". For the AGAIN DS game, click on the link for "41 used and new" under "More buying choices". You will see the list of all sellers and the condition of the item they are selling. You can then click through to a specific seller and use the "Contact seller" link to ask about condition of item.
Yes
I have windows 8 and it runs fine on mine. I play almost every day.
Yes it seems.
I have this disk and I was able to download both. I can't remember if I had to download one and then the other or if they downloaded together. but I have both downloaded. I'm sorry but I don't have any solution at this time.
I don't have an apple ipad. I'm up to a Windows 7.
I just answered your question,but If you click onto Scramble at the top of the game it will shuffle the game while you are playing it.
I have not put it on a laptop. But it seems to work okay with Windows 7 on my PC. Should work OK.
Would not recommend this product the disks are loaded with Malware and will infect your computer!
Yes
I am not quite sure. That is all I know.
It might. I do not no for sure. Try it and let me know.
If you plus it a usb 3 port which is blue it will not work . It has to be in usb 2 ports only. And try to down load the software for the controller too. Some games might not work with this controller aswell. Kinobo USB Gamepad for PCs XP/Vista/Windows 7 and be fine. I got win. 7 and 8.1 and it work with no problems at all. I use it for driving games like for all NFS games.
My instructions came inside the box. Also I live with a brother that knows how to set one up... Sorry I couldn't be more help.
No
It works with My Powerbook G4 but very limited software I could try it with
If your controller is wireless, you will have to go through a few more steps. However, using a wired controller, you only need to plug in the USB, start your game, go to control settings, and make sure "360 controller" or simply "controller" is enabled. The following are instructions for a wireless 360 controller. 1. You need to have or purchase a wireless gaming receiver. Assuming you have windows, the software should automatically install after a few minutes. 2. Like most wireless gaming controllers, a "search" button will allow you to connect with your device. However, first you need to press the search button on the receiver. Then, press the search button on the controller. 3. If you do not connect, check your batteries and open up the "My Computer" window to make sure your receiver is connected. (Usually it will appear under devices) 4. You may need to configure some settings in-game to make sure the buttons are bound to the right control. 5. If you are still having trouble with the controls, the Xbox forums have easy-to-follow advice for most Windows versions. http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/windows/xbox-controller-for-windows-configure#72e400f5ec8c476d9cf9c94e50918dcf
Unfortunately i have no idea if it works on those or not, I have Windows 7 on my computer. Sorry I couldn't be of more help.
I can't speak for Macs but this is the first and only product I have returned to Amazon because it didn't work even for a PC so I can't imagine it would work for a Mac
Mine didn't even come with a cd, and my PC doesn't recognize it after downloading the driver... terrible
No, the sound card only shows up as a Microphone In (under recording) and as "Speakers" (under Playback). Sorry, this doesn't sound like the the sound card you're looking for it seems.
If you have a recent Mac, you will find that in System Preferences &lt; Sound, that the headphone jack (output) is interchangeable between output and input (at least it is on my 2010 13' model). So if you strictly need a mic input, your Macbook Pro can do the job. However, if you want to have audio that is not from your computer's internal speakers, you will need this sound card, or one like it.
I use mine on a Dell Windows 32 bit machine running Windows 7
No it wont work, you would need something like this. http://www.amazon.com/Headset-Buddy-Adapter-Smartphone-01-PH35-PC35/dp/B00332DPDG/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1395030768&sr=8-3&keywords=Cellphone+Headset+To+Mic+Jack+Splitter
If the speakers work with your Desktop then the sound card and the speakers on your desktop are working fine. If for some reason the speakers do not work on the HP Laptop then I would try to plug in head phones, if they do not work either then its a good possibility that your sound card is bad or misconfigured. The Turtle Beach Audio Advantage Amigo II will likely allow your speakers to work with your laptop. I did the same thing on mine and its much cheaper than sending the laptop to a shop to get the soundcard replaced. Let us know if it works for you.
Yes, it works fine.
Yes, the usb plug provides both audio input and output functions
I just tried it and could not get the mic to work using only one port. The headset will work but not the mic using only one port. You will have to buy a separate mic to use the Turtle beach USB. It has two ports one for headset and another for mic. It works great with Windows, Skype, Apple Mac, and Linux. No drivers to install. Just plug it in and it works. You will have to buy a cable adapter like this one to get it to work with your headset.. http://www.amazon.com/EZOPower-Smartphone-Headset-Adapter-Neckstrap/dp/B007JP0IVU/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1426469582&sr=8-5&keywords=3.5mm+audio+cable+adapter+for+headphone+mic+combo
Yes it does, I use it on my PS4 and my PC
Yes, it works very well with my max
I'm not sure, but I'm doubtful of Android compatibility. While the 3GC is a good Direct Input (D Input; Logitech and most generic) gamepad, it doesn't feature Xinput (360) compatibility either.
There's a driver available on the website here: http://steelseries.com/us/support/downloads
idk
Don't waste your time buying this piece of crap. Seriously, you may as well burn the $20. That will at least warm up your hands for a few seconds. When I opened the package on mine, one of the control sticks had broken off inside of the blister pack. no big deal, super glued it back on. Tried for HOURS to get it to work. Nothing. Computer wouldn't recognize it, wouldn't even acknowledge that anything was plugged into the USB port. No drivers available. It's a worthless brick. Albeit not even a very heavy or durable brick. Just use an Xbox controller. They're plug and play. You won't have any issues with one of those. It won't break before you even take it out of the packaging, and it'll work.
The game is no longer in production, thus the new and unopened versions are running more expensive...
To hatch simply have an egg in your party and walk around and it will take a while and to trade go to a Pokemon center and go to the top area of the Pokemon center
Chimchar is the only one in that game. The others will have to be traded or hatched I believe.
Yes
No it does not
Yes
Yes, it is.
It does not work with pokemon bank but it works with poketransfer which is a partner ap. You download poketransfer for free, put any pokemon you want to transfer into box 1 of you PC, then they get transfered into the pokebank "transfer box". From here you can move them from the transfer box in pokebank to your Pokemon X, Y, Alpha Saphire, or Omega Ruby game. Once placed into the transfer box you can NOT get them back onto your Heart Gold version. It's a one way transfer. Hope this helped!
I believe so, I bought both Pokemon Hearr Gold/Soul Silver on Amazon, both brand new, and I do believe I saw the code in it. If the game is brand new I see no reason for there not being a code. Either way owning this game is a great choice.

Yes
Yes sir..... If You have a track ir the experience Will be much better.
yes.its not a very good game.
You can play offline all the time
Yes it should work with windows 8. I still enjoy this sim. It's not as complicated as some other air combat sims although some missions seem impossible to win. Enjoy&#128077;.
look on sim web site
There ar 3 options arcade , realistic And simulation
It works with Vista, but its a Disc not a down load
Yup.....
Yes is does work very well on Windows 7. It is a frustrating game to get past the third mission. I've been on it for months with now success. Many are so frustrated they created a blog to solve it.
Yes, unless it is a xl 3DS
fits real tight. I returned it
its curved a little and I don't know the exact dimensions but I can tell you that he puts his dsi in the soft sleeve and his charger in the same side and his MP3 player. The back side holds 12 dsi games and not alot more. It is about 2 inches taller than the DSI game console. It is about 2 inches wider as well. The straps are sewn well and its easy to take with on your wrist if you need your hands for other things.
No
No, it does not.
Yes
No it will not.

No it will not.
Yes it works okay if the screen is smaller they look kind of squashed if it's a 15 inch screen but you can install it and it will work. I've been using it.
It goes to a few countries at a time on Windows 7. Once you complete these, more pops up.
I don't know what the JC means--but yes, you can play it on your windows 7--that is what I have.
Yes, it does. My husband's computer is has Windows 8.
I bought the game and it is installed on my computer. I didn't download it.
I couldn't get it to work either. I think Amazon's version is corrupted.
It depends upon your specific system resources. SH5 requires a powerful CPU and GPU. The recommended system requrements are closer to what the minimum requirements really are. The community at the Subsim forums has plenty of threads addressing the nuances of SH5 as well as mods to address what Ubisoft would not let the developers finish before release.
You would but I have Windows 7 home premium and it would not function on my system
Yes. It ran fine for me on my windows 8 laptop.
i'm running on windows 8...but it should run on vista as well...

My batteries are lasting about 2 hours a piece, so I looked into replacing the guts. (it has two tiny rectangular 3.7V Lithium packs taped together inside, the battery case is easy to open with only your fingernails) The markings on the Rat9 batteries were: "ZT-061148 1S2P 3.7V 440MAH 101120" The closest Google match for this was: http://www.d2-technology.com/product.php?m_id=6 (2) D2-LP-061148 - 3.7 Voltage(V) - 230 Typical (mAh) - 220 Nominal (mAh) - 6.0 x 11.0 x 48.0 mm - 4.0 g
The Rat 9 that i bought the other day just came in, it's 5600DPI. Pretty misleading product page.
Good question! I've been watching since April when my 2nd G7 stopped working correctly. It's time for something new, and this looks like it, but I'm not buying without at least some other user reviews to read first.
The dimensions are, and these are not exact: 4.5 inches from front to back (length), 3 inches from side to side (width), and 1.25 inches tall. The palm rest extends to make it almost 5 inches long but does not affect mouse to desk contact length.
The allen screw is fastened really tight and can be hard to unscrew on first adjustment. I used an allen key to remove the screw on first adjustment. If you mean that the tool slips between your fingers use an allen key the first time you remove the pinky rest, if you mean the tool slips in the screw head then you have damaged the head, try using a larger allen key or a grip paste on the screw head.
Very durable.My son uses it for gaming and keeps it connected to the computer, and the rest of the family uses it as an everyday mouse.
Why is this item under review
It was probably just the other black piece that holds the weights in, if the tool holds them in then I don't really see a problem.
If it's like the RAT 7 you can
old post but it does have clicks between each scroll both thumb and normal scrolls do and the normal scroll middle click is a little harder then a standard mouse but i like it its not to hard to press but enough to prevent accidental hitting of the button when scrolling.

Black cat is not in this game from what I remember
This game, like most spider-man games, is a single player game. The only Spider-man game I can think of that is 2 player is called Spider-man: Friend or Foe, but that game is for younger kids than this one...hope that helps. This game by the way...is really good...my kids love it.
This should cover your questions: http://www.esrb.org/ratings/synopsis.jsp?Certificate=29480
No she isn't. I don't think she is even mentioned.
By default, the button on the left is treated as "right click" and the button on the right is treated as "left click" (so backwards from a traditional moue). With the Razer software you can set up a profile to auto load that switches this, sensetivity, macros, etc.
5(L) x 2.76(W) x 1.73(H) in / 127x70x44 mm
If it is for gaming you dont want a wireless mouse, buy an original deathadder they are actually really nice.
might a bit too heavy for graphic design. I find that playing with this kind of mouse for hours tires my hands a bit.
The 5 buttons on the mouse are fully customizable using the Synapse 2.0 software (which is compulsory installation to use the mouse). So you can make it a "left click" on any of the 5 buttons you want.
If you get the left-handed edition, it's great!
Yes. The mouse wheel and logo do light up.
Actually it can. It installed easily and quickly without any issues. I've played this game on my iPad and the only difference with an 8.1 touch laptop (Acer S7) was that when you "plant" a plant you have to quickly double tap it to get it to stick in place. That's not an issue if you're attentive. Other than that, good to go and IMHO better than buying a download with many of the intrusive issues that seem to go with that. Enjoy, a great game for all ages.
It installs completely, then you can put the CD away and not use it while you play.
Yes, it does.
It comes as a cd. You download the game on your computer (PC or mac) and play! Plus you can put it on mulitple computers.
yes I think its abetter game for alarge screen I phone
It doesn't work on mine.
I think it should. I don't own an xbox nor have I used one recently, but if the xbox has a USB port then it should work.
Sorry couldn't tell you my bought it to karaoke with but it didn't work.
For me all i did was plug it in but i waa usibg it for my xbox
Sorry Steph I am not to sure, I am using it on the wii and on my laptop. I don't see why it shouldn't though.
A knockoff =[
Yeah that's not a problem, or at least not for me
The microphone is universal to any game including sing star and of course, American idol &#128522;
The one I ordered works with my Xbox 360 slim
I believe it does, I use Wii U but it should work with PS3. I am unsure so I r
DUDE, look on internet if anyone has same problem, if u don't find any fixes, u should ask for a refund and buy antoher game like MW2 that is more optimized for pc than BO.
Yes it installs it on steam
No
Yes if u have steam u just put the serial number and u can download it from steam
Well I just tried the game on an other pc windows 7 and finally it worked but am not sure about xp
I didn't care for it either. Too much verbal content, story, etc. No flowing from action to action. Just didn't float my boat. Wasn't up to other Call of Duty games.
Yes. All PC version of CoD Black Ops must lunch through Steam. And to play this games the code in the disc box is necessary and sometimes the discs are unnecessary.
No...and the download doesn't work with W8
I think so when i had my windows 7 laptop the game was unplayable, but i think the problem was that my graphics wasn't good enough. It just jumped from frame to frame. Have a new computer , windows 8, and it now works flawlessly
yes
Yes you can use a wii gun or the classic controller
I do not know.
NTSC
Yes.. It does
Older Wii?There Is Wii And New WiiU.(You Can Play Your Wii Titles On The New WiiU)We Have Just The Regular Wii So Yes It Will Work For You.
Nintendo discontinued any live gaming for the wii shortly after the wii u came out.they do have playback but I am not quite sure if it can be played live on the wii u.but it yes it has offline play mode
I do not have a wii mini --so can't address this directly. I do know that the case indicates that you can use the classic pro controller with the game. Hope this helps a little. :)
I'm sorry I don't have a Wii I have the xbox 360 and ps3 for this. My apologies. Sorry I couldn't assist you.
Yes it does have a regular offline mode to enjoy,playing against automated enemies
There should be a read.me file on the disc. "Also look under options. This is a very intuitive game. You have to have patience with the putting. Difficult to learn the pace of the putts.
No it is not based on my findings
I bought this game when it first came out. I've run it with an AMD card installed and on a computer with GEForce GTX 780 Video card, Win 7 Professional, 64 bit processor, and have never had a problem with the game crashing. R
Nothing, cuz it is not 90 bucks...
four, two in black and two in blue.
Yes they do I bought them specifically for my ps4 controllers and they fit just right
No it would not. To big.
yes my friend They are great and fit perfect You will definetly note the difference
There are different kinds of KF's out. I assume no. But the caps feel awesome, and also add a little height to your sticks. I hope this helps!
No. At least not for an Xbox 360 controller. If the original joystick cover has torn completely off, these fit fairly loosely and rub against the analog stick housing and make the stick harder to move.
these mainly just add comfort to your origonal thumb sticks, they do not add height
Yes they should. My Ds4's one stick is torn off and these fit well enough. Does the job. They are not full fit but doesn't matter much.
Sure do!

The one I received was a genuine Razer mouse. Had all the paper work and everything.
Nope, it only comes with a blue LED.
The mirror is smoother and easier to clean. The normal abyss looks and feels better, but it will absorb sweat, so after a long period of using, it's not as good as b4
Yes, it does
yes
yes :) that's the magic of it, Two Identical Buttons (left and right click) and the scroll wheel. perfect for switching for lefties
It makes a click but its not very loud. In fact i really didn't even notice it until i saw this question.
Amazon does all my shipping, so I believe they do.
I found this version to be exactly identicle to theoriginal abyssus except the buttons are MUCH stiffer- painfully so. But the grip is the same as far as I can tell. Personally I prefer the original
The mouse comes with software controlled acceleration via a razer client, and a couple hardwired sensitivity settings on the base. You can disable the software accel, I dont know offhand what the default is but the client is easy to use.
If the game cartridges allow it, then yes.
No, but you can use the 2 controllers that come with it.
Just get the red, white & yellow wires, unless you're trying to connect it to a digital tv, then you'd probably need the RF Adaptor
Not good at all. Plus the console played less than 20% of my games.
Yes
No
More features
Yes but the included controllers are junk I couldn't get mine to even work better off paying 4-5 bucks for an original SNES controller off ebay

I did a little research and as far as I can tell the pc version does. It also looks like you may be able to use unsupported steering wheels with some tweaking, but I haven't tried that, so I can't guarantee that it would work. Hope this helps.
im not sure if this game support any racing wheels because if not a driving simulator man, i play this game with pad controller and respond very good... greetings.
Yup. Sure is.
Of course,,,it has a campaign and split screen so two people can race
That is an excellent question Jorge! Unfortunately there is no option to alter language output in COD Ghosts (at least for the North America release). In the PS3 XMB I believe there is a language change option but it won't affect the in game/bluray disc/dvd language output. You're more than welcome to write an email to Activision suggesting that feature in COD Ghosts through a future update. But good question by the way.
as long as you have an internet connection, PS3 is free to go online. so yes, online works :)
Yes
14 maps with out the dlc.
Yes
Yes, Free Fall is included
Although these are listed, it still depends what comes with your attachments, but I hope this helps Primary MW2 Weapons &#9726;Assault Rifles &#9726;Sub Machine Guns &#9726;Light Machine Guns &#9726;Sniper Rifles &#9726;Riot Shield Secondary MW2 Weapons &#9726;Machine Pistols &#9726;Shotguns &#9726;Handguns &#9726;Launchers
Yes there is call of duty: ghost onslaught dlc packages game. Come with the first dlc pack.
Yes you can play as Michael Myers on the map Fog
Certainly
omg, i searched and searched for this. even broke the leg sensor and had to buy a new one (lol). So, after you load your profile, in the bottom right corner, click "help & settings", after click "settings", then click "rebind peripherals". after that you press and hold the button on the arm sensor till it syncs up, then do the same with the leg. also, make sure the USB dongle is plugged it. Hope this helps.
I would return. I never got mine to work.
No, I haven't. I've been trying since I bought it several month's ago but it's never connected. I get same same error message.
I haven't tried it, but I doubt its backwards compatible. The resistance band is the same though.
Try brand new batteries in each receiver and put try to sync using the receiver in USB port 1. For some reason mine wouldn't work if I put it in the lower one. Try port 1 first then port 2 and if that doesn't work the receiver (or sensors) may be defective. If that's the case try to pick up the NFL one cheap and use the gear in there for both games. They will work with both / either game but don't move the receiver at all once it's synced.
You can yes. You need the arm band, leg band, and the 2nd USB dongle. I googled it and this is where I read it to http://www.nutwiisystem.com/two-players-and-ea-sports-active-2-exercising-with-a-friend.html. hope this helps :-)
Yes it does. Works pretty well, in my opinion. It's not perfect, but you can still do the exercise.
Yes it comes with everything
I wouldn't think so. Then again I'm not familiar with the Wii Mini. It has a USB thumbdrive looking thing that plugs into the back of the Wii and uses the motion sensor to read movements provided by two bands that you wear while working out. I hope my answer was helpful.

No
No it doesn't, and you can't buy just any card. You have to buy expensive cards from Sony.
The one I got came with a charger
You can buy any of the movies and TV shows just as you can on ps3 and ps4. You need to remain connected to Wi-Fi of course. You can also load your own vids on the memory card and watch them. I did it using avi files if I remember correctly. If you don't already know, the memory card are expensive and don't hold much data at all, I believe the largest is 64gb and cost around $100. So keep that in mind when your considering how many games, movies, music albums you are thinking of using.
Yes, to me it's worth it. There's a ton of games. With PS+ you can download games from PS1,PSP, VITA, etc.. If you have PS+ you get free games every month to keep if you keep your PS+ subscription current. After a few months of free games it pays for like half the cost of the VITA. Make sure you get a memory card if you will be downloading games. Or buy a bundle with a card. Some VITAs don't come with a card, like the regular Wi-Fi version. I have an 8GB card with a few games on it and there's still room left for at least a couple more. Hope this information helped!
There is no storage. You must buy a PsVita Memory card. It is a memory card specific to fit the Ps Vita only and nothing else...unfortunately. I didn't realize that til after I purchased it too but I was fine with it and still bought one. A 4GB was about $10 or so.
Even if it is in Spanish u can always change it to English just go to settings
The PS Vita comes built in with the ability to play PS1 games you just have to download them from the playstation store
If we bought from thr same person I its the original vita with the mystery port
It does, but you have to re-purchase them on the PS Store. Even if you have the original UMD, you will have to shell out whatever Sony deems the price of the title you want. Keep in mind, you will need to space to store these games.
Yes you can connect a ps vita to a ps3 and no you can not turn off touchscreen
no. and the PC multiplayer community is very very small. the only games i was able to get into was either team deathmatch or kill confirmed. everything else had almost no one playing and could never get into a game. if you are buying this for multiplayer...id pass.
Yes. I think we need to get used to these on line platform's. I don't think they are going away any time soon. I have accounts at Steam, Origin, and U-play.
......a DVD drive maybe?
Yes, but you have to install steam preferably
I just think it's awesome to play in pc! But make sure ur pc is good enough to run it!
I'm using windows 8.1 pro and the game performed very well no problems. I hope you enjoy the game as much as I did!! Hope this helps.
Not that I know of. English is the language of the creators, and the characters in the game. Maybe there is a version somewhere in a country whose primary language is Spanish, otherwise, you will figure it out eventually
Unfortunately YES.
yes
Don't know. I've only played it solo.
Yes. Only one
Yes. As long as the previous owner doesn't have it coded.

Yes, you can buy an internal hard drive and install to the console, also works with some external hard drives.
Do you mean the Kinect sensor? If so, then yes. The Kinect is only required for Kinect games.
if you look at the back of the individual game it shows what controllers or accessories are required/or possible for that game. ie: a game might show two wii controllers to indicate that two controllers can play at the same time.
I ordered my 9yr old son this for Christmas, and it came in the original box.
No it's not if your looking for a xbox360 slim just search it up
No it's used, yes all the original accessories included, not in it's original box.
This is the latest model of XBOX 360, other than the XBOX ONE, The size of the unit is about the same size a a Direct TV cable box.
Yes, included is a card telling you to download the Cerberus Pack for ME2 as well as the ME3 Extended Cut & Multiplayer free from the PS Store. But, there is further DLC for ME2 and ME3 that if you want, you'll need to purchase.
It is a hard copy. Nothing special. Just the three disk and 2 papers, propaganda. The manuals are digital inside the disks.
Hey Emanuele The games all come together in one foldable holder, however it is not a steelbox. Hope this helps.
Correct. And they are all incredible.
It is included just download the free add on and it is definitely worth it, my personal favorite trilogy in gaming history
5.3G minimum (for PlayStation 3)..but to be safe I would keep more than that free because it doesn't specify if that's for one game of the entire trilogy.
Mass Effect 1 - none, Mass effect 2- Arrival, Mass effect 3- From the ashes, Leviathan, Omega, and Citadel.
The mass effect trilogy is mostly a single player experience although mass effect 3 does have a multiplayer survival that is up to 4 players.
PlayStation 3, Bring Down the Sky will be included both on disc and on the PSN download, Mass Effect 2 will still have the same DLC on-disc that it was originally shipped with: Cerberus Network; Genesis; Kasumi; Overlord; and Lair of the Shadow Broker. Finally, Mass Effect 3 will also be exactly as it originally shipped.
You are going to get the same vibe with mass effect as you did dragon age story wise and rpg wise. But the combat is much better in mass effect than dragon age. Mass effect 1s combat is kinda clunky. But they improve significantly in the second and third game.
The controller originally sold with this console was wireless, but there was no controller included with mine as I bought mine used.
Yes. But I never received the game that comes with the system
I believe you receive one controller and all the cables needed to play.
Mine did
The Kinect sensor should come with the complete Kinect assembly. There are also Kinect rated games that utilize the sensor for game play. Hope this helps.
NTSC
It was the Christmas Bundle Bargain in 2012. I bought it for a friend in 2012.
Yes
Yes
yes it has a 250 gb removable hard drive and the 4 gb internal.
The av cord on all xboxs are the same however the power cords to switch from unit to unit . Xbox 360 has 2 different power sources where as the slim use only one. http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41jGFTGuMCL._SX385_.jpg
I bought it around June. Maybe July. Can't remember the exact date. But I have yet to have a problem with it.
For the 360 you buy the Kinect device seperate.
No hard drive
No it's up to the buyer.
You have to buy the turtle beach adapter and plug it in the spot right above the HDMI but yes.
Yes
Yes it can work on the Xbox one, in order for it to work you have to buy the and xbox one adapter for the headset
Mine did work with the PC with no problems.
They will work (I use them with my PS4). Note, however, that for in-game chat you need to order an additional cable that plugs into the PS4 controller (similar to the old xbox solution). Here is the turtle beach link, but you can find the cable cheaper elsewhere also: http://www.turtlebeach.com/product-detail/cables-parts/ps4-chat-cable/464. Also note that although the newer turtle beach are dual band (i.e. PX51), this version is single band and can get a good amount of interference with WiFi signals. I had to use a LAN cable with my PS4 as I received too much interference when using the WiFi for the system.
Need to turn Bluetooth off then on in pairing mode and go to audio settings to voice settings and connect there
Yes you can, if the tv have bluetooth, everything with bluetooth you could
Yes, the PX5 is compatible for surround-sound game audio out-of-the-box, but will require a PS4 Chat Cable or PS4 Talkback Cable for chat compatibility. Compatibility and setup information for all our products can be found here: http://www.turtlebeach.com/connect
I haven't experienced that but like you said if there is no audio they do turn off sorry I couldn't answer your question
Your TV will need Dolby Digital Live output and an Optical output.
Yes, a tower/headset holder.
Yes, just pair with your iPhone by Bluetooth and you're done
Yes it can work on the Xbox one, in order for it to work you have to buy the and xbox one adapter for the headset

As a matter of fact, it does =)
It should. Xbox games tend to be grouped by titles. I bought marvel ultimate alliance gold and it worked with my marvel ultimate alliance saves and unlocks.
Yes it does.
Yes
There is free drive, where you can just drive with your friends, but it's not an open world.
This would be perfect for your kids. I understand your concern and can assure you, none of that material is found anywhere in this game
This is the regular edition
It is the complete game with all standard cars and tracks, when I ordered I received the American Muscle DLC pack, September Penzoil DLC pack and the 2013 SRT Viper GTS-R for free. All the other DLC's you will have to pay for.
Sorry I can't help you there, I dont have a Kinect. Try cheat code central, there are a ton of experienced users there.
Yes, and while some dlc codes aren't guarenteed, there's still lots of stuff for you to do. :)

Battlefield bad company 2, was an awesome game. Enjoyed it way better than I thought. So I bought battlefield 3. That game was great and intense, I really liked that one as well. If I had to choose between the two it's a hard call. With today's gadgets for war and to match call of duty I'd go with battlefield 3. Just stay away from battlefield 4, Geez a waste of money and time.
My son, to whom this game belongs, says he doesn't think you can get one on a used game. Bear in mind, though, he is 13 and may not know what he is talking about. We have a used game store in our town. If it were me, I'd call that store and see if they had any advice - do you have anything like that where you live?
Yes. It includes a multiplayer section along with the single player campaing. See it for yourself on the follow youtube link: Battlefield 3 - Multiplayer Gameplay Trailer: http://youtu.be/FRqfFfuVuNE
Xbox game discs only work with Xbox consoles that are sold in the same region. For example, if you purchase an Xbox 360 console in North America, you cannot play game discs that are sold in Europe or in Asia. An Xbox 360 console that is sold in Europe can only play game discs that are sold in Europe, and an Xbox 360 console that is sold in Asia can only play game discs that are sold in Asia. It is not possible to make an Xbox 360 from one region play discs that were produced for another region. Back to the top THINGS TO TRY 1. Determine whether the game disc is from the same region as the region where you purchased the Xbox console. To verify the region, view the back of the game package. Look for a one of the following codes: * NTSC: North America and South America (United States, Canada, Mexico, Chile, and Brazil) * NTSC-J: Asia (Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan) * PAL: Europe, South Africa, India, Australia, and New Zealand 2. If this symptom occurs with only one or two discs, search the Microsoft Knowledge Base for the specific game title or titles. If you find a known problem, follow the information that is discussed in the article. 3. If this behavior occurs with only one or two discs, and no known problem exists, return the disc or discs to the retail store where you made the purchase. 4. Turn off and unplug your console, remove the Hard Disk Drive unit and any attached Memory Units, and then reconnect your console. Try the disc again. If this appears to resolve the issue, turn off and disconnect your console, re-attach the HDD and MU, and then delete any saved games for the game title in question.
It depends on how much space you have on your console. If you Don't have a lot of space on your console then don't do it. If your console has a lot of space then maybe. Don't just fill your hard drive completely or it would cause some lag. If you found this helpful then great. If not I am sorry for wasting your time.
The disc is locked for USA used only.
I don't know. I don't play the multiplayer part of the game.
There is only one controller if you need the second one you need to buy it. Also some games use kinect you need to have that also I was told if you want to make this x box to hold more info you need to get a flash drive. Before I bought it on line I asked a lot of questions who had one and also people at stores who are in that department. I hope I helped you
Yes. When bought in store they normally come with the game console, cords, and 1 controller.
Idk why it says old version thats what I was expecting but its the new slim version.
Yes you can
Wal-Mart sells an external 500MB drive just for Xbox.
It works 100 % as expected, but when i purchased this "slim" i got the newer 360e, i wanted the slim cause it has more usb and is a bit quiter than the "e," but other than the false advertising which amazon was pretty unwilling to fix, this xbox works with no problem.
Yes
No
The manufacture date is october 25, 2011 (corona)
I honestly do not know. Its a regular Xbox. Not slimmer than my other one. I'm sorry. I bought it for my 10 yr old. I'm not to game console savvy.
yes.
Can't help. the label that has the key is so faint it is blank. The whole thing is useless!!
I have planned the game on both Windows 7 and Windows 8 and the game works fine on both.
I don't know. I bought this game for my son and he couldn't play it because it is not compatible with our new computer, it's an older game. Please make sure your computer program is compatible before you buy the game.
The game is really set up to be played solo so absolutely. It's a great game and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
My son only has the Gold Edition and plays it just fine.
Our apologies, but due to our large volume of emails, we do not currently have the resources to answer individual questions about our inventory. Here is some info that may be helpful: EDITION: We sort our books by the ISBN (10-digit unique number) of each book. So when you see our listing, the edition will match the information posted. Sometimes a vendor will sell a previous edition under the most recent listing; that is why you will see other vendors specifying an edition number to clarify that they are selling a different edition than the one listed. If you search for your book by its ISBN and find our listing, it should be the correct edition you are looking for. CDs AND DVDs: We try to make sure to list in the comments section if a disc is included with the book or not. If the comments do not specify, the book does *not* usually include a CD. STUDY GUIDES: Unless specifically noted otherwise in the comments, we sell study guides and textbooks separately. A textbook from us will *not* include the study guide. CONDITION: We sort our inventory by condition according to the following guidelines: Like New - Undamaged cover, no missing pages, all pages undamaged (no creases or tears), no underlining/highlighting of text, no damage to binding, no writing in margins. (Could easily be mistaken for brand new.) Good - Very minimal damage to the cover (no holes or tears, only minimal scuff marks), dust jacket not necessarily included, minimal wear to binding, majority of pages undamaged (minimal creases or tears), highlighting/underling acceptable on textbooks as long as text readable and it is not an excessive amount, no missing pages. Acceptable - Some damage to the cover but integrity still intact, binding slightly damaged but integrity still intact, possible writing in margins, possible underlining and highlighting of text, no missing pages. (Item beaten up a bit but it works.) If an item has some unusual type of damage, such as water damage or a binding so badly damaged that it is falling apart, it should be noted in the comments. Thank you for your business, E-Commerce Customer Service Team
idon,t know hven,t played that game in a while.on line is fun thogh.it should be still alive
not very well, it will run, but expect tons of errors and graphical glitching... it will also depend on your hardware, but the worst graphical glitch you will encounter will be the crash scene. advice: pass this game by, its not worth the frustration/being so linear/and all the issues and inconsistencies just aren't worth it in my opinion. complaint: by far the worst game released in the last 15 years, hands down. story line is almost nonexistent. gameplay mechanics are terrible.
Not sure what your processor or memory capability is but I used an 8800GT video board and the game worked fine. Game play is above average to good.
1. That gamepad will support Homefront. 2. We need more information about the system specs, since there's a huge difference between a 2 Ghz Intel Celeron and a 2 Ghz Intel i3/i5 multi-core processor. Would also need to know what kind of graphics card you have. Looking at the minimum system requirements, though, you need at least an Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4 GHz or AMD Athlon X2 2.8 GHz to run this, so I don't think you'd be able to do much with the game. 3. The game does require Steam. 4. I'm an avid PC gamer and have had a Steam account since a few months after it was launched. While I have had a few issues (I can count maybe 4 out of the 600+ games in my library), the issues have never been inherently related to Steam. Homefront ran just fine for me.
In short - no. There are still a few private servers scattered about here and there but it's officially dead in the water.
The version I purchased, did not. You can purchase it through steam, however I liked having the discs and if memory serves, it was less expensive from Amazon. I do have it listed in my steam library and can boot from steam that way.
I use Logitch Extreme 3D Pro and it works for me. Can't get the throttle to work on the joystick, but the key board works for that. Hope that helps.
No, Iron Cross Edition is an original Rise of Flight copy, not an expansion.
Both
Yes you do. See Rise Of Flight .com, look under the store tab for pricing.
No, it was just the chatpad.
Yes you sure can.
Yes, where the chatpad and headset are is see-through plastic and the rest of it is the original box.
Yes at the bottom of the controller
I honestly don't know. But this one didn't even work on my box
You should still be able to use any headset with it, it's essentially an extended microphone jack. I'd still research outside of amazon to be sure.
The manual says it's only for the xbox 360.
I doubt it. I think the controllers are different.
Yes, I use it on netflix all the time. It works well. The mic broke like 3weeks or so. Didn't last long, but I mainly bought it for the pad.
I would say no this is listed as only chat pad, but read the seller description if it doesn't say anything about the headset assume it isn't included.
No.
No. You just need Xbox Live to play against other racers and post your special achievements.
I play with the regular xbox controller and I love it. Why would you need a steering wheel? Just use your normal controller...
No.

No, just for Rock band 3
Hi! No, because Rocksmith converts the analog signals from an electric guitar with its special cable, and this guitar is basically sending a MIDI (digital) signal. I hope that helps... I know I wanted to do the same, but ended up buying a nice Acoustic/Electric (Ovation) for Rocksmith.
Yes.
No. It only works with Rock Band 3.
Highly unlikely. As far as I know, the Mustang PRO guitar is only compatible with Rock Band 3. It isn't even compatible with earlier versions of Rock Band, let alone games from a different series.
no
Yes but you will need an adapter for it
As far as I know, it's only dependant on system (Xbox/PS) and should work in any region. That being said, I only tested the regional functionality on keyboards (wich work well US-&gt;EU). Cheers!
have not use it with these but that being said I use it as midi connection the dongle has not been a factor. it will work with native instruments like contact, core player etc. the only thing about the guitar is it has a sustain about it, when you make a chord you can`t mute it with your hand by touching the strings like a real guitar. I have seen a few videos on youtube abut the guitar use check them out. it`s fun to play with. hope this was helpful,have fun jerry
The last time I checked, when I clicked the link to go to the product page, one of the pictures IS the official cable because of the embossed Microsoft logo, however, when I ordered one, I got a knock-off. I just recently found a first-party cable at Wal-Mart for twice as much, but at least I now have one that I know for a fact as first-party. As I said in my review, just to stay safe, your better off looking elsewhere because you don't have that guarantee here. I hope this helps.
Yes, you can transfer any memory to all 360's. (Arcade/Pro/Elite etc.) It is possible to transfer data to slim from any old 360 as well too. The only problem is slim to slim HDD, and that's because the casing is built different. This old transfer cable will plug into a slim 360's USB port, but the other end will not fit into the hard drive. There is slim adapter for the fit of the the newly built casing, but money and time can be saved when you take apart the old 360/slim HDD's. Then you can place the old hard drive into the slim casing and screw it back together. That's just a shortcut I would take if I don't need any further memory yet.
As far as I understand it, the hard drive, once formatted with the third party cable, ONLY works if the cable is plugged into the system and the hard drive (which should now be 32 GB) is linked with the cable and NOT where the hard drive originally should be. This is due to the hard drive now being read as an external storage device. If you have a first party cable, then once you have moved your data, the cable has done its job and is no longer necessary. It all comes down to if you have a cable straight from Microsoft or one from another company. I hope this helps. =-)
How most cables should be set up for the original 360s are where you place whatever hard drive you WANT to transfer content TO needs to be connected to your system, and your existing hard drive needs to be connected with the box end of the cable. The USB end connects to the back of the system where you would plug a wireless adapter or some other accessory. Be warned about my review however; if its third party, you could wipe your new hard drive. I do NOT know about the slim or X1 looking models. I hope this helps answer your question. :-)
Yes it can.
No. The transfer cable powers the new hard drive while transferring.
In the directions it explicitly says 'not intended for long term use'. So I would say no, but I haven't tried.
Bought mine 5 months ago and it came with one.
Yes it DOES!!!
It actually does strip the HDCP content, I record HDMI with HDCP and without the splitter I cannot record, with the splitter I can!
I'm not sure you can, this seems to be the revised version. To my knowledge Amazon was threatened w/ a lawsuit from I'm not sure who but according to the reps at Elgato capture selling HDMI strippers as the action itself was illegal. I'm not sure if that somehow affects your situation but the ones I purchased also didn't work but for a few hrs.
Mine did not work for anything,wasted money.
Not unless your computer has the option to extend its display. Even so the two tv's would show the same image as this is a splitter...
no idea
Only 110-120v.
I am not sure how you intend to use it with Chromecast. Are you intending to split the signal received by the Chromecast dongle? I would assume that it would work fine but I could be wrong. The Sanoxy unit worked well the HDMI output of my receiver to take it to two TV's.
I don't know. I'm using HDMI male to male from computer to two HD TVs. Sorry.
Yes, both will receive the signal being sent out by the Directv box. I currently have it setup with a 3d projector and a standard hd tv. I am running standard hd to both. I have not tried turning on the 3d since I never watch anything in 3d.
Yes it will. But at this point i've only tried it on my PC with windows XP and using a Super Nintendo emulator. I haven't much tried it past that, but I think it should work on almost anything. It's plug and play
Yes they are but if u are playing fps games I don't suggest this controller the gun shoots way after u let go of the trigger just a heads up
What I do is plug it in to a usb plug next me but then that idk
GameStop or a game store
It will work on any computer
Don't even bother buying this controller I bought it and when I received it, if never turned on or even worked at all its a waste of money
I'm not sure. But the analog is similar to the Xbox's
No its wireless make sure the sensor is properly plugged in to the usb port, it may also just need to be charged
No. As a owner if this not so great product. It doesn't charge fully and you can't disconnect it. The arrow buttons are disfunctioal. Sorry if I don't help by telling you this.
nope.
Should be a switch on the back for Xinput and DirectX input. Make sure it's on Xinput and it should work. "jstest-gtk" (sudo apt-get install jstest-gtk) is a program that will allow you to calibrate a Game pad, it's pretty much a must have for all Game pads and can be acquired from the Ubuntu software center also, if you use that OS.
According to Logitech it is 1.8 meters which is 5' 10"
I bought 3 of these because I bought 3 copies of Flight Simulator X for Steam (one for me, one for my wife, and one for my son). I thought I would have to reprogram the buttons but it worked great out of the box. It's the exact same style controller as our Xbox 360 controllers. In fact I think these are a more comfortable fit. It worked a little funky at first but I realized that was my fault. I had to flip the switch on the back of the controller from X to D. I think that's from Xbox mode to Direct mode. After that it worked great and I was able play on Steam.
Yes. Go to http://www.logitech.com/en-us/support/gamepad-f310?crid=411&osid=14&bit=64 for the controller, click downloads in blue, and underneath the controller image you will be able to choose windows 8 (32 or 64 bit) for the drivers. I'm sure they are on the cd provided too. If not, you can just get them off the site.
It works, but you have to flip the switch on the bottom to "D". Some games may need Gamepad Companion, which will recognize the controller when it is switched to "D" and then let you map the buttons and joysticks to keyboard key presses and mouse movement. I just tried it with Solar 2, and the game detected it (in "D" mode) but all the buttons were mixed up and so it was nearly impossible to play. So you might have to use Gamepad Companion to map the buttons to keys to get around that for some games.
nope
I would say yes, the analog sticks give you more precise movements because they are analog not just a digital on/off signal such as arrow keys, but does take some getting use to, so at first you will be worse. in my opinion, however, if you want this for racing games, I highly recommend buying a cheaper racing wheel over a gamepad, provided you can spend a little extra $$$ and space isn't a huge issue. even a cheap $50 racing wheel will be 1000 times more realistic and precise feeling than a gamepad. If you dont have much cash, maybe a cheap thrustmaster steering wheel would fit well? If you have plenty of money to blow and you are really into racing games, nothing beats a logitech G27. period. (I am currently using a microsoft sidewinder steering wheel from the early 2000's and I LOVE it, im very into racing games and wish I had money for the G27...
A deadzone means that you move the control stick and nothing happens. Please see the following response found on Yahoo answers: "The deadzone is the region of movement which is not recognised by the device. Generally this is in the region around the center position. Leave your joystick centered. Now using a very light touch, slowly move it in any directon until on the screen the cursor or pointer moves. (repeat in other directions also) The region (or amount of movement) that the joystick can physically move without registering any change is the deadzone for the stick. Varies from model to model, in some you can even adjust manually or by software the amount of deadzone in both the X and Y axis." This answer was found on: https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=1006031104229
There's no reason it shouldn't if installed properly, always get drivers from Logitechs site, an remember to flip the switch in back of the controller.
It Does
6 feet long
if you switch it to Xinput it works just like a 360 controller. If you use Direct-input, it Works on a PS3, but i'm not sure about PS4.
I myself do not own an F710 but I've seen it and held it in my hands. The answer to your question is yes its a bit thinner and lighter than the F710. What I like about these devices, they have a switch on the underside to switch from Dinput to Xinput. What that means is your device can be seen by very old games which support Dinput (old controllers style) and it can be set to play new games which support the Microsoft Xbox 360 controllers when switched to Xinput. Once set to Xinput any new games which support the Microsoft Xbox 360 controllers can be played by this device.
I'm not sure about the sega games but it has x input and direct input,which means the older games you can map the buttons to play them .The button mapper in on the cd that you get with the controller,hope that helps.
I don't have a PS3 but as far as I can tell it does not work on the PS3 console. Yes it does work on the Mac system, just plug it in and it should see your device and install the necessary drivers.
Yes it will work on Steam providing that the game have support for controllers. For games that is on Steam which do not have controller support you can use an emulator like Pinnacle Game Profiler. You can go there website at "pinnaclegameprofiler.com" and download a thirty days full trial of the software to emulate games on Steam which do not have controller support. As to your second question...There is no dead-zone problem with this particular gaming device unless you bought it faulty or if it has taken a bad fall from you or someone else. One thing though as any other product, overtime as you put pressure on the analog sticks they will start to come of the dead-zone but that my be years from now or months from now depending on how often you use it for gaming. Sometimes lets say for e.g. a first person shooter game if you need to do some quick running or looking around and the tension in the game will have you putting pressure on the analog sticks, so that in itself will, after time throw off the dead-zone.
Well i don't have a Mac but i searched around and that it works on some games and kinda gives trouble on others ,it is the drivers logitech doesn't seem to have drivers for Mac probably you can check out the xbox controller.
Yes
I have tried it on two different Windows 8 machines and it works just fine.
The headset will work on Mac. However, you can't have the 7.1 software on your Mac, and therefore, you can't have 7.1 in your headset. Stereo and mic will work just fine, though.
Very Recommended.
As a game developer, I use these headsets religiously. They are not the best quality, but compared to 90% of wired headsets near the same price range they are just as good. Only problems I have with the headset is the boom for the microphone. The elbow that attaches boom to the left headphone is made out of plastic and if dropped on that elbow it will break with ease. (I strength my headsets by attaching 38 gauge aluminum with some liquid steel adhesive, to the elbow join) I have used a number of these headsets and currently own three. Two for work and one for home. Being able to get up and get a drink or rush to a project meeting, without stressing about tripping over a cord or ripping the USB out is hard to beat. Hope this review helps, if you have any questions about the headset let me know and I'd be happy to answer them for you.
Sound quality is quiet good, especially for a headset. You can get stand alone microphones with better quality but for a headset the microphone is quiet good. I don't get any background noise, NO scratching or hum. I use it quiet often for gaming and Skype calls, works perfectly. The "G-Keys" allow you to assign a push to talk or any sort of macro keys. Let me know if you have any other questions. Please give me feedback, thanks!
the size is almost as big sennheisser hd 650, maybe you can use that headphone case
No
The cable that plug into the headset serves only as a charging cable. The end of the cable is also marked with a battery icon. Removing the USB wireless receiver from the dock also disconnects the headset even when the headset is plugged in via the cable. This headset sends and receives audio over a wireless connection, so NO IT DOES NOT. The other answers are talking about the charging cable. I've been using my G930's for just under six months and haven't experienced connectivity issues not caused by myself. I've knocked the dock off my desk and it disconnected momentarily though immediately reconnected. disconnecting and reconnecting the USB receiver reconnects just a quickly (unless the driver crashes. You can manage to restart the G930 software and it will fix the issue though it isn't always your friend.). Issues might occur if one plugs the receiver into the back of their computer. I have my receiver in the dock on top of my desk. I greatly recommend this headset.
Nope there's no point in paying 60 bucks on a 7.1 soundcard in tandem, unless you also want to have a surround speaker setup. You are correct John, all audio is processed by the G930's soundcard including the simulated 7.1. While using the headset all other audio hardware in your system will be ignored.
Yes. I purchased this product though and it did not work, it would hook up to the TV and turn on but it would not read any games I put in it. I tried multiple games none would work.
Yes you can . You can buy the reproductions here on Amazon or if you have the original controllers they are the same design. They will fit this system I have one . I also have another retro bit that looks like the super NES system you can use the original SNES or the NES controllers on that , and the games from both systems . They work very well play them all the time .
No, you will need a converter
As long as you have the rca or composite connections, yes
Yes.
Check with best buy they have connectors for that
POWER BUTTON BROKE AND WONT WORK
There is still the "A" and "B" button but, there is also "AA" and "BB" ; holding the "AA" is the same as constantly tapping the "A" and the same goes for "BB" and "B".
Some of my games work and some don't. I think you should try to clean the cartridge. If it still doesn't work, i don't know.
Yes
go to your local Walmart or Target. They might have a 360 style controller for the ps3 might cost you a bit though. maybe 30 or 40 bucks.
If you have what is pictured then it loads straight in the front right on top of the on/off buttons you can see in pic.
3.55 was a long time ago, I believe it was the first major geohot exploitable firmware but to get one of those you'd have to buy one that specifically has one. You can downgrade to 3.55 on certain firmwares but not the current one
Because the demand still high.
No none of the playstation 3's in production are able to play ps2 games
125v is it's limit. 220 would just burn it out, and we don't want that.
I'm not sure what you are asking, but our family really likes this particular PS3. Works great and was in excellent condition.
Firware?
If you download them from the playstation store, then yes, i believe so. The store may not carry the games you want, however. Otherwise, i do not believe the system is backwards compatible. Therefore it cant play the disks.
It's a 2009 model and Idk about the other part.
You will have to check if the software is compatible with windows 7. I had use the software on an older version of MS Windows XP or 98.
You are not missing much as the game is a let down being from Hoyle
i can not say for sure.
not sure why by I know that I wasn't happy with the game and thought that it would have been a lot better coming from Hallmark. Very disappointed in it
Well if I'm not mistaken,I think there's a warranty you can get from the store but I believe that is only available if you purchase a brand new ps3 & it has to be within a year too. Ima check to make sure though
Yes you can. Just plug in a USB drive and copy your game saves onto your USB; that's what I've done for my Fallout 3 saves.
The model number is CECH-3001A depending upon which release of the console the model number will vary.
ps3 controller YES, ps3 remote like tv remotes NO, hdmi control NO after firmware update 4.11
yes
Yes it is but I recommend the ps3 slim 120gb models.
yes
Goes up to 7 players
The one I received did not come with a controller. I had controllers left over from my old system. It did come with the box but did not have the Styrofoam inserts. I don't remember getting an HDMI cable. It did come with the ac adaptor. I think your mileage will varry. You may get something that will look like it was pulled off a store shelf or you may get something that needs some additional things to be purchased. You may want to contact the seller directly if your looking for a complete system with all Accessories.
Es lo que dice en la caja
Yes, but it a lot harder than the normal zombies. You get hit once and your dead. There are different maps, no perks, no pack a punch, no revives, and the prices for things are jacked up high. But it's pretty fun but not worth $20. Try to find it cheaper.
All ds, and 3ds systems connect to wifi but Nintendo shut down the wifi access for their old ds games
Sorry I don't no but it works on his Ds
thank you for the good A+A+
Its a campaign, and then there's a killhouse. Yes with bots.
Yes
You do not need wifi to play Black Ops for the DS. Any DS can play this game. The Wifi connection is only used to play against other players around the globe. Without the wifi, you can still play with a friend nearby (your friend must also have the game to do this) or by yourself against the computer players. I have not played Black Ops DS with Wifi or a friend and still had a blast (on the regular DS).
Try this out. When you want to quit playing, choose to go to the home menu and you'll be asked if you want to save. Choose save and when you want to play again, you'll start off where you left off. That simple.
Yes! I puchased my code about a year ago and altjough I found it difficult at first to install, (read the reviews, my instructions on how-to are there if you need help) it has worked perfectly. The game is still on my Wii, has never ever crashed and I still happily play occassionally.
Original
You have to use the classic controller. It's a few bucks
No you don't
I would guess yes. I've never done it but this game absolutely will not work without the classic controller
Wii shopping channel has not been taken down yet so you can still redeem the code from the Wii shopping channel at this point. And you can get the first one from the Nintendo eshop if you would like.
Yes it works on wii and wii u

You don't have to, but you can hook up 2 each of the original controllers of all three systems. I recommend doing that if you can afford to buy them separately. I myself bought one of each. Be careful though, cause some of the after markets aren't the best. It's better to buy the originals but pricier...The wireless controllers that come with the system aren't bad, but the control configuration is weird. On some systems a is b and b is a. It will throw you off till you get used to it. Also you have to be directly in front of the system for them to work and pick up the sensor. Hope that helps Katie.
It will play any true NES, SNES or Genesis title, Castlevania included.
If the warranty is from the seller of course contact them first. If it is from the manufacturer you can contact them at (626) 571-5100 to see how to proceed.
Yes you can, works great!
You have to buy controllers for all 3 systems. The wireless controllers it comes with do not work
I used an snes controller so I don't know where they are on the ones provided are
My daughter loves this one. I have the knowledge of the other one.
Long as your flat screen TV has RCA inputs it will hook up. I have a Samsung but it is about 7 years old. No issues using RCA inputs. Wireless remotes are the big issue. Stock up on remotes. Each systems games need to use that systems remotes unfortunately.
Yes
There are Indeed a few sega games that do not work with this console. If you search the internet there have been many attempts at compiling lists of Incompatible games. I believe it is something to do with a chip (fx?) used in some game cartridges at the time.

plug it in your wii remote.. like u would the num chuck
Yes
No. It plugs directly into the Wii remote
Yes, it will work. The buttons are not in the same position as original N64 controller so takes some getting used to. I am not sure if this is because it is a generic controller or not. Possible non issue if go with brand name controller.
No
No
I don't know if that game supports the classic controller, but I CAN say that this particular knock off won't work at all. DO NOT BUY THIS CHEAP KNOCK OFF. PAY MORE FOR AN OFFICIAL CONTROLLER.
it plugs into the normal wii remote, so its wired to that but not to the console
Honestly dont buy this third party controller, my wiiU doesn't recognize it at all
3 feet. But it plugs in to your wii remote.
Black cat is not in this game from what I remember
This game, like most spider-man games, is a single player game. The only Spider-man game I can think of that is 2 player is called Spider-man: Friend or Foe, but that game is for younger kids than this one...hope that helps. This game by the way...is really good...my kids love it.
This should cover your questions: http://www.esrb.org/ratings/synopsis.jsp?Certificate=29480
No she isn't. I don't think she is even mentioned.
I agree with Duc. All the latest mechanical keyboards use the same switches from Cherry, so they're give the same basic feel. In terms of price, the Razer keyboards, which use Cherry MX Blue switches seem the best and combined with the macro software is a rather great choice. I have two Filco Majestouch keyboards, one with Cherry MX Brown (tactile, but not clicky) and one with Cherry MX Blue (tactile + clicky) switches. In my opinion, I feel that the Cherry MX Brown switches are better for typing, but they're easier to fat finger, Blues are better for gaming as it's harder to mistype a key. The only thing is Cherry MX Brown switches are harder to come by in the US, but both Filco, which are now purchasable on Amazon via a merchant and the Das S Silent utilize said switches.
Supposively they are Cherry blues, but they fail so often in this keyboard that I'm not convinced this information is true. Had three of them, all three had their switches fail after about a month. I have three other keyboards with Cherry switches and none of them has that problem.
The only back light there is on this keyboard is the Razor logo. It's only Blue, but you can turn it off, make it pulsate on and off or just have it in a solid state.
No, this is the non backlit one. the blue razer icon is lit though
I do know of at least one person on the notebook review forums that has one and loves it...HOPEFULLY they're better now. I have heard of a lot of problems with Rosewell's, and even some with Das Keyboard, soooo I don't know what the heck to buy!
Standard Blackwidow Ultimate has only blue with five intensity levels. There are other versions that give other colors (Dragon Age 2 with red and Battlefield 3 with orange), but each keyboard can only give one color at a time.
It's a loud keyboard the Cherry MX Blues have a distinct clicking sound
The space bar issue is one that can occur to the space, shift, keypad +, keypad enter and keypad insert keys. The problem is that underneath said keys there is a thin rod running across with 2 little plastic parts holding the rod onto the key itself. This supports the wider key size, but when one of the little plastic parts pops out of the underside of the key, it will block the keys downward motion and will not allow the key to depress evenly, as the rod is only attached on one side. You will hear a rattle if you give it a shake. Pay shipping costs and wait for Razer to click the key back onto its rod then send it back, or just do it yourself... The issue is bound to happen some day- I hope this will be of some use to someone.
Yes, it does.
Since they are used keboards it would entirely depend in the vendor selling you the keyboard. The black widow is pretty durable so unless they were very careless with it I would say there is a good chance they are in good to excellent quality.
Blue
Hey Brandon, since it is a mechanical keyboard you can rearrange some buttons, you will have to reprogram the keyboard using Razer's Synapse software
They are blues up until this years model which uses new custom Razer "green" switches as a replacement.
This is not the Spanish version.
Cherry mx blue
Absolutely, had it for about two and a half years now and I'm a claw grip gamer, no complaints about comfort or button accessibility.
Sounds like you have roughly the same size hands as myself. I think you could comfortably use this mouse. It is slightly bigger than a standard mouse, and a decent bit bigger than most wireless mice. My favorite thing about this mouse is how comfortably it sits in hour hand after using for several hours.
This is not a question, but what I'll try to help you anyway. If you lift the mouse off of you mode pad or desk or whatever, then it will stop functioning while you have it in the air. Once you set the mouse back down, it immediately begins working again. The laser only works when it is close to something.
Approximately 13 centimeters in length, 8 centimeters width at the widest point, and 4.5 centimeters tall. Maybe a large apple or small grapefruit for length, kiwi for height, and width of a large banana maybe?
it worked for me,........windows 8.1
Yes you can reprogram the buttons to certain options listed in the software, but the Storm tactic button (thumb button on the side) you can't change it for another function; however, Storm Tactics button allows you to set combinations built to offer 32 extra button outputs for macros, scripts, rapidfire which is useful for mmo games. There is a profile switcher button underneath the scroll wheel as well.
It is not wireless and yes it supports all versions of windows XP or later so yes 8.1 to.
lowest is 500 highest is 4000 here is a picture of the dpi http://tinypic.com/?t=postupload
This was a gift for my grandson who does have a Mac OSX. He is a gamer, I believed he liked it a lot and have NOT had any problems with it.
I reall. y am not that good with computers,but I did get a warning about a virus or problem with that game and I didn't install the game!!
Perfectly. Actually is made for win7.
Yes, it installs and runs on XP, Vista and Windows 7, and is a really fun game, but it does have a few annoying glitches that you'll get used to and forget about. A great game for the price.
I have had this game for quite awhile and never got a virus. Hope this helps
Yes it has worked just fine on my computers in Windows 7.
yes, it works with Win 8.1

No, they come with 2 double A (AA) alkaline batteries. The rechargeable battery pack and charging cable is an additional $20. That's for any controller, old or new.
http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Windows/dp/B004QRKWKQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1408137095&sr=8-1&keywords=xbox+360+controller+wireless+pc does but this one does not. It's only a few dollars more (at the time I'm posting) so probably worth just doing that.
There is a small black button on the console above the USB port that you push. Then you press the sync button on the controller as well and they should sync
Yes, it should work if you have the correct PC receiver to go with the controller.
Nope, it only works for xbox 360 console.
This is a original xbox 360 wireless controller
No it is not just the regular wireless one, try the Camo controller its good
Yes
No
Since I don't have a play-and-charge kit, the following is my informed opinion. Yes, it will work assuming you have the rechargeable batteries installed in the controller. I looked at the bottom/back of my wireless controller and noted it has the input for this (http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox360/accessories/batterieschargers/xbox360playchargekit). Finally, this is from Xbox 360's support page describing the use of the kit: http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/how-to-use-xbox-360-play-and-charge-kit. Hope this helps.
Yes.
Yes it does. Simply plug and play
Yes. It came in the original Microsoft box and everything.
The controller comes with a USB adapter, so you do not need anything for PC use! I also use it for PC games only.
Just plug and play.
No, but you can change it. The old d- pad for the new one. It only cost like 8 dollars.
Yes.
Yes it is. It works perfectly on Xbox 360 and on PC
Yes it does.
Sure does
I would try like a nokia phone charger. thats what it resembles most to me
Battery life after a year of usage and taking good care is about 5 hours continuous. I can get 30 feet+ away (line of sight), but never needed to go outside the house with it. Concrete walls will block the signal like any wireless device. Mine only charges when plugged into a device that is turned on. I'd like to have 2. So one is charging while the other is in use wirelessly.
My kids use it they charge it over night and while they @ school.so I'd say they play for 7 hours on 1 charge and get reception on the whole first floor of our house
Yep
Works property well if you configure it as the way 2 be Usually all Gioteck EX02s Bluetooth Headset for Playstation woks fine Go to setting and configurate Bluetooth advice your psp4 find it and follow all the instruction do not skip steps if you want good quality sound and reception
I doubt it. The software you need to configure it doesn't even work with a 64 bit version of Windows. Don't buy this product.
Yes, mine did.
There's a pattern with peripherals with a lot of custom options that don't seem to work with the eagle eye. To my knowledge and experience, buttons that are added other than standard buttons from a company to both mouse and keyboard won't be accessible by the eagle eye's software. For example your razer deathadder chroma's side buttons, will not be compatible with the eagle eye, same for the keyboard; but the keyboard and mouse should work fine, but remember, only the standard buttons of a mouse and keyboard will work. Hope this helps. Best to luck!
Yes
There is wireless console for PS4 (keyboard and mouse). for PS3 only this i tried. But logically if the wired keyboard+mouse works , then the wireless should works too but not the combo one . Wireless keyboard need to be in seperate USB adapter from the wireles mouse. And make sure that wireless keyboard and mouse does not require any specific software driver installation
I don't know as I've never heard of Keymander until now. Only thing I can suggest is to find reviews on both. I will say the Eagle Eye works well and is configurable for all the PS3 buttons and sensitivity, so it gets a thumbs up from me. ;) Hope that helps.
Yes you can as well as other fps games.
It ran on my 64bit Windows 7 just fine.
When I bought my copy half of the so-called included dlc wasn't available so had to contact sega - who gave me a new steam key to download it correctly. So if my experience is anything to go by, it's vital you have steam.
Check your memory. You might not have enough
Yes it does
There is no manual. These days, game manufacturers cut as many corners as they can (not like the '90s, gaming's golden era); instead there are various tutorials. Anyway, to your question - the validation code is on a small strip of paper glued to the inside of the box. It's really hard to miss.
The cd inside will only point you to download steam it does not have the game. You will then have to create an account. After that you spend the next 3-6 hours waiting on the game to download from steam. Once downloaded you will have to launch the game through steam but, you are allowed to use it in "offline mode" if you do not want to stay connected to steam to play the game.
Hi Ken. This game and steam both have big learning curves. Even if you know what you are doing, plan on a full day of prep before you want to play. In theory you could install and play in the same day, but I find my enjoyment is much greater if I wake up and can go play without having to deal with steam and sega. Plus these games are just ok anyways. I recommend TW Medieval Kingdoms--you dont need steam and it has the best mod of any TW game: Third Age. In my opinion that mod is the peak of the Total War gaming experience. I think this once great franchise was ruined by greed and the need of some people to control others. Cheers.
Yes it will. I have a 2010 model laptop with Windows 7, and the game runs just fine in the US. Actually, it works better than the original individual games (I got this one for the expansion features).
The controller works with pretty much any emu you use. i had a little trouble getting kega fusion to recognize it, but after switching the controller to direct input and restarting the emulator, it finally worked p.s., if you haven't bought the controller yet, don't. it's plagued with latency and connection issues. don't be convinced by all the 5 star reviews on this site. do some forum research on google and you'll know what im talking about. as long as you're directly in front of the reciever, no more than 6 feet away, with absolutely no objects in the line of sight between controller and receiver, you'll be fine.
It works great. If you want to map the buttons, use xboxdrv. It's in the Ubuntu main repository.
To me this feels right in the middle between the Xbox controller size and the PS controller size.
yes you just need to go to Logitech website site and download the latest drivers for mac
There are pre-set configurations for the most popular games available with the software drivers. Once you load the pre-configured layout you can customize it.
2 AA batteries.
Wired, I think.
If you windows 8 installed the drivers uninstall it from the "device manager" and install using the CD and run compatibility for windows 7... if that's not the case... try installing the drivers manually using .inf file or controller files
Yes. I've played several modern games using the X-mode and older emulators in D-mode. Both work without any issues.
Yes; it is plug-and-play on both 32- and 64-bit OS.
No it does not. you use your controllers but it works to charge two at a time
Yes, I use it with 220V and work very well!!
The controller might, it depends how thick the skin is. It won't for the move controllers for sure.
Most electronics stores have power cables just take your old one in with you so you can match up the specs i.e volts amps watts
It plugs into the wall outlet.
I realy don't know I was just using it for PS3. Sorry I could not help you with my answer.
1, 2 or have all 4 hooked up at the same time. It's stated in the description.
No, it only allows one of each. However, there is an extra usb connection that allows a cable to be used for charging another motion controller
Seriously? It is used for Xbox 360. The headset works for that system , not a specific game
Better than I expected.
Hooks into the controller.
HI, this headset is ONLY for chatting. You do NOT hear the sounds from the Game
Yea it's a echo it happens it means the other person as there mic to close to there tv or there mic it to loud and it's repeating what you say!!
Being close to 1 another with the headphones will cause skipping.
It's durable however it doesn't work for the system.
Well, these are less quality then the other high tech headsets. I think mainly because you can't hear in game sounds through them.
No
Two feet. It plugs directly into your controller so it's not meant to be long.
Some features work out of the box, such as the normal keys, the audio jack, the media keys and the USB hub. Other features require the software which is not available for MAC. Meaning it's a waste of money if you have a MAC... because you won't get the advanced features out of it.
No backlighting besides the steel series name on top, can't tell u how it is compared to the mad catz never owned it, but FYI this isn't a mechanical key keyboard the benefit of the keyboard is the switchable key sets
No
No never overseas.
Used with some scratches on the bottom right. Awesome for Starcraft 2 I have wings of liberty set brand new in box and a used one only used twice. Macros work great too!
We bought the Key Set first and realized we needed the actual Keyboard. The keyboard we bought had a generic key set with it, we just added our World of Warcraft keyset to the key board.
No do not buy this key board the software is broken, get a G510
In your start menu (no idea for mac) there is the steelseries folder. Check there and the user manual is in it. Also if you right click the steelseries icon it's there as well. Did you experience any issues with the engine install after a reboot? 2 others here have had it freeze up. Good luck!
Every Wii (apart from the mini) has the ability to use hulu & youtube & netflix with built in wifi
The wii will run any wii game. It is not compatible with cds, dvds, wii u, and limited game cube games. Some wiI games such as just dance may requite a dance pad not commonly included with the system so please be aware of individual sellers descriptions.
New In Box
The Red Wii with New Super Mario Bros. is a great system. I got one for Christmas and yes, it has 4 ports for Nintendo GameCube controllers, which is great to play Smash Bros. Brawl. It also plays GameCube games such as Smash Bros. Melee and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. There is also a place for Nintendo GameCube Memory Cards so you can save your GameCube game progress if you have Memory Cards. I'd definitely recommend the Red Wii.
Absolutely,the red Wii is backwards compatible. I did have to buy a Gamecube controller and memory card. Not all Wii's are able to play Gamecube games but this model does.
It does not require it but be aware you can only use your code once. I had to uninstall my game and contacted them for help reinstalling it. He said it would be so easy to just do it online but failed to mention I had to install origin on my computer and download it and all my expansion packs which took forever! It is nice to register the game and get a origin account incase anything happens but I did not have WiFi on my computer ans played the game many years without making a account.
yes it will play
I tried playing it on 8.1 64 bit and it didn't work.
Of course, go perfect
no, is not a multiplayer game.
I don't have a real mouse but the one on my lap top you should be able to use a real one tho the game is for pc. Also once you get the game read the manual it will show you game controls if you don't like some of them you can pause (spacebar) and go to settings to change game controls.
intel 2 core 1.6ghz or amd athlon64 2.0ghz or faster, windows xp, vista, 7 32/64bit, 1gb ram or 1.5gb ram for vista/7, dvd 8x, 24gb hd, 128mb xp / 256mb vista/7 video card, sound card dx9c compatible, mouse and keyboard
yes, it runs on windows 7

Yes I'm playing it right now with 8.1
There isnt a dl code it just downloads from amazon
I don't know why not. It is about 2 Gig. I downloaded it at my cabin and then took it home on a external drive. I had no problems.
Open My Documents and look in the My Games folder
It took me several try's for the download and installation process to work properly. For some reason it almost stops downloading early or is interrupted and misses things. Colonization is downloaded first, I figure. If you delete everything and install again from Amazon it will eventually fall into place. Extremely frustrating but it will work. Amazon should let you use the same code for a few days. They let me anyway.
As long as he has the download code, he can download it at his convenience, tomorrow or next year or whenever! :D

It's an expansion pack of the base game. It needs the base game in order to work.
go under your orders click on return or replace items. click return times and a list of the things you bought recently will come up. select the item you need to return or replace and a manger will walk you through the steps.
No. But there should be a Mac or PC AND Mac download available somewhere.
You can install it on both
Under 'My account' go to the 'Your games & software' and they should list your download code there. Then you redeem that code with Origin to start your download. But make sure you do it on the Origin client app not on the sim website, otherwise it won't work.
Yep! You should have no problem having them both on your computer. Running them at the same time, however, might cause some difficulties with processing speed/graphic rendering.
It's an expansion pack for the PC.
I would uninstall and istall the game reboot your computer it could just be you need to update your computer first
Yes
Yes, all Sims 3 games (Base game, Expansion Packs, Stuff Packs) Will work on Windows XP Service Pack 3, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8.

i think its a 1.3? i have it and the picture isnt really bad.
0peration depends on software in use , 6.00 or later is required . usb connector on top is universal on all models . Camera may not be recognized if usb is dusty , just clean off with a dry Qtip if needed .
9-1/4" x 6-1/4" x 2"
It is an accessory. It is a camera that attaches to the top of the actual PSP player. I personally did not like this product. I received a defective one. The latest model of the PSP is the 3001 slim type the into your search bar.
yes
No, this will not work with the Vita. This camera uses mini-usb which is not a port that the Playstation Vita supports. With this in mind the PSVita already has a rear and front facing camera making this device not necessary. This camera will really only be used for the PSP-1000 through 3000 models.
The PSvita already has a camera installed.
This camera and the built-in cameras on the Vita are all 640x480. Looking at pictures from both, they're about the same in terms of overall image quality. Not terribly good. (That said, there is a higher-quality camera available for the PSP if you want to import - the 1.3 megapixel Chotto Shot which was never released in North America.)
I cannot tell you. This is a gift that I bought for a young man who lives in Haiti and is not fluent in English. He could not possible help you either.
Yes it will run on mavericks (10.9.5). Your mac already has a video card built into the hardware, no need to upgrade it for RCT 3.
I have updated my system straight through from 10.6 to 10.9, and it has never not worked. It should be fine.
The lowest OS it will run on is 10.3, and a G4/G5 power pc. See what generation PowerPC you are. It'll be slow on an iBook, I have it running on an 07 Mac mini with intel processor and it runs smooth for the most part, but it's does use a lot of ram and lags a bit at those times.
It should run on maverick, the lowest os it'll run on is 10.5 leopard.
Yes. I use Windows 8. Keep in mind the LA PD mod. It adds a nice Los Angeles feel to the game.
No the editor is not included
Yes, it will, on my PC with windows 7, it has glitches to play a small screen size, smaller than my monitor
Yeah. Works fine
I do not believe you can. 911 First Responders is the United States version of the game because for some reason they couldn't use the original name here. In other countries it's called Emergency 4. Maybe you can find a version of Emergency 4 in your language.
Yes
when you down load the mod if its a rar file or a zip file you must extract it then go into the properties of the game click and drag it into the mod folder for 911 first responder! You must restart the computer after it has been done! if you need more help I an help you!
A lot of mods are just drag and drop into the mod folder, which is located in the main directory for 911FR
You can't... the amazon download never came with it. The LA mod and a few others don't use the mod installer so you can get those
It does, read the manual it comes with on installing the mod. They have a PDF on how to
Yes, I have friends that use them on PS4 for FF14.
Yes, it ships as it would had it shipped directly from the manufacture.
Absolutely! My son uses it on his Mac
It's a rechargeable battery. This is not like most mice I've had that comes with a nub you plug into the laptop and takes regular batteries that last about a year. This comes with a battery like your cell phone would take. You plug the mouse into a charging cradle and then can play wireless, but the cradle has to stay plugged in. The battery charge will only last a day (several hours), and then you'll either have to charge the mouse in the cradle or switch to the wired version. The battery is replaceable.
Yes, all versions of the naga have tilt scroll wheels
Sorry, my mouse is not wireless so I can't answer that. I don't like to click and have nothing happen or have the battery die at inopportune times.
Not as wide as I hoped, its ok but at times I have issues. Would love if it was wider.... Not for very large hands but it's use able.
We do not ship out of the States. Thanks!
Normal box and it come wired or wireless which ever one u want
He's it does
Yes. It works pretty well with shooters, and or RPGs.
Well one my best friends has that mouse. I have the original and the 2012 version so far. Really only major difference is graphics on the mouse and not sure if molten is hand size customizable. 2012/2013 standard Razer is.
Even during intense raiding (4 hours no break) it would never get hot. Very well built. There is a reason every top gamer uses razer.
I primarily used it for gaming (just using the 1-12 buttons for 1 through 0, - and =). There is a way to Configure Razer mouse settings on Razer Synapse 2.0 but I never used it. I hate to misinform you, so I would research what you can do with Synapse 2.0 or go to the Razer website and ask support directly. Have a good day.
Not that I'm aware of.
It says it has a 2 year limited warranty and free online technical support.
Yes, to my belief the retail box does say this is Mac compatible.
Yes it's compatible with Windows 8 and Windows 8.1.
mmo = massively multiplayer online, basically games like world of warcraft, rift, star wars old republic are mmo's. This particular model of the razer naga is not wireless. However it gives you plenty of cord length to move around freely. This one is wireless -----&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Razer-Rechargable-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B004AM5RAM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1384215398&sr=8-1&keywords=naga+wireless+mouse
Sure is.
I'm not 100% sure but if the ps4 is able to connect with Bluetooth devices then it should work. Any device that is able to connect by bluetooth can work with this mic. I use it for my phone, ps3 and I plan to use it once I get a ps4.
A standard headset will connect.
No. it only comes with a USB cable. Hook up to USB to charge.
Yea
It works with my nokia phone
No it does not just USB cable that plugs into the system
No, It is just a standard remote.
It fits just fine.
Hello, the Wii remote is just the normal version so you have to buy the adapter separately.
It says that, but when I tried to connect it to the WII it would act like it registered, then when I selected two player in a game, a screen popped up and told me to reconnect the remote. I repeated this 5 times and it never connected.
They dont sync right. Mine do not sync either. Took a chance and got burned.
call amazon customer service, they should be able to help you
Yes
They are not OEM but work pretty good
Yes, I'm currently using it with the mini. You just have to Sync it.
Motion plus is built in. You do not need anything additional.
you are correct. this cable doesn't have HDMI.
I've had a lot of cables from amazon come in a sealed plastic bag, usually in an amazon box. If your ever worried its used, look at the ends that plug into the console for verticle lines. Mine were brand new, still smelled of fresh plastic. I love this cord. Been using it for about 2 years now. If you have it hooked up to 2 consoles at once, you will get an image but no sound. Just unplug it from the unused console. I use it on my ps3 and it still let's me use 1080p on my HD TV. I had origionaly bought them for an older projection TV, but have since gotten a flat screen, and still use them, don't even need to get an HdMI. I have compared the 2, the HDMI is almost worse because its so sharp, the edges are a little too cut.
No
This one plays all my games on ps2. The ps1 games work on ps2
It works for me. As far as i know, all ps2's have the same video output connector type
If you have it plugged into multiple systems at the same time, it will sometimes do that. try only having the ps2 plugged in and see if that fixes it
Probably, mine works perfect. You will need to provide more info about the setup for someone to give a meaningful answer.
No only 360
It is the proprietary port that is a trapezoidal shape right next to the hdmi port on mine.
It's for Xbox 360, not Xbox One.
You buy the game outright from amazon. It is not like the other game companies that charge you every month.
I have them on my computer (windows 8) but I play them in windows 7 mode. So I would say yes to windows 7.
Yes, it plays on Windows 7, which is my operating system.

You will need 2 accounts. Doesnt matter if they have a xbox 360 or an xbox one. If they both want to have their own profile and play at the same time they need to have an account
We got the headset, the keypad, 400 Microsoft points, and a year subscription to xbox. Great deal.
It should be on a 1 page sheet of glossy paper, or on a thicker green card
It would be under the account of the user, nothing to do with online access.
Yes, a single account serves on both consoles. This headset will not work on the Xbox One nor will the keyboard.
Just to buy it... It's an attachment for the hand controller of your Xbox 360 so you can text faster it comes with a one year subscription to Xbox live and very basic headset.
I read the fine print and only one problem may be looking at you, here it is, quote " points can only be redeemed by member accounts based in the country of purchase. " so if there's no local shipment center in your country then the points may be useless, there was no warning/caution on the 12 month card except for this one, quote "not available in all countries, see www.xbox.com/live/countries ". Now onto the physical goods, the chat pad works anywhere but only with a xbox 360 control, that said if bought from a foreign seller then the default keyboard may not be in your language or preference, you can check by looking at the back of the chat pad, if in English you're ok. Now onward to the mic, this should work on any control with a 2.5 headphone jack standard on every licensed xbox 360 control. Overall all should be good if bought from a local distributor.
They need to be plugged in you XBOX 360 controller So if your controller is wireless then yes
The micropoints for the xbox 360 will convert to real money and I don't know how much but I am pretty sure it will still work for you to buy some arcade games, music, videos, etc. If you buy this product you will be very satisfied once you get it. No need to worry about the microsoft points that will be convert to real money so theres no change since the Microsoft has change the points to real money.
no... this is patric!

Audio jack but you can buy an external sound card that makes it USB if that's what your worried about.
Nope, 3.5mm although I'm sure you can find a converter.
not sure but the mic is crap. hard to hear you, makes it sound like you are talking threw a pillow.
I don't have an exact measurement for you but its long enough for me to be able to walk and get something in my room without taking my headset off. To be fair though, i have a small-ish room
Don't buy it. Mine fell apart.
Yep but you can't play with the play & charge kit on the Pc it is just for Xbox
the cable directly connects straight into the xbox controller. if you have a charging battery pack it will charge the battery otherwise it will power the controller without the need for batteries.
Yes I believe that should be okay as long as its syncd to whatever it is your using
Yes, then it is just a corded controller.
Yes it comes with a battery.. However the battery does not operate without it being plugged in. It's an aftermarket battery.
Yes
no it dont charge things just makes them turn on when the cord is hooked up
No
3rd person.
it is just as good as uncharted . very enjoyable& fun to play.
There's blood and gore, intense violence, and strong language. That's why I believe it's rated M for mature
No it is for the PS3
It does have gore in it. If I remember correctly there is not a lot of cursing. It is not for a younger child. There is no nudity or lewdness. But there is a lot of killing.
It says it requieres 5.2 MB
You do not, this is a reboot of the franchise and this game is the origin story for Lara.
Sorry i dont know any.
I have this game in english with no spanish subtitle .
No there is a lot of older versions of this game
Yes it works on PC. The gas and brake aren't very accurate though.
As far as NASCAR 14, I don't know the answer to that. I only play Grand Turismo on mine.You don't have to be that close. I can sit down on my couch, and it reaches up to about 10 feet comfortably from the couch to the TV.
It works with other nascar games, it works very well.
yes and perfectly I should add,you might have to customise your controller in settings I dont rember
No
Yes it does. But the accelerator and brake pedals are made of low gauge plastic combined with poor design and won't with stand a serious adult driver and will crack. I'm happy with my new gran tourismo with an 11inch wheel with realelistic steering radious. And the pedals are made stronger. Worth every penny.
I have the same issue unfortunately and haven't been able to resolve it. I got a message via Amazon asking if I could answer this question. I jumped on it because I do have this issue, but when I initially got the steering wheel, the foot pedals did work. In fact, they worked until I started messing around with the settings on screen when I was trying out different configurations of the buttons and pedals. The pedals stopped working and I've never been able to get them working again, even after resetting the buttons to factory settings. I would advise doing a warranty return if you're unable to get the pedals working. Sorry I can't offer more help.
Yes it does, im playing on it right now! It plays all ps3 racing games.
Hmm let's see it fits well on our TV tray made of wood standard size TV tray that's what we use it in when my daughter and I play driving games. 11 inches wide, 8 inches tall and 9 inches from front to back. It's sturdy too.
Yes it seems to work with all of our games
Yup
On The right side of the Xbox there is one cover. Open it. Place the Hard drive in the space provided, aligning properly and push it. Close the cover.
All together
Typically this hard drive can run faster and have things downloaded to it faster. But not much. This goes inside of the console which protects it, and it's harder for this to get corrupted files, it's made for the xbox, who knows what could happen in another external drive. Both external and this however can be plugged in from one xbox to another, if you recover your fakery age. The downside of external is you may need to find a place to store it when not in ise. That's about it. Size, convenience in storage, and an ever so slight speed difference
Yes
Pretty sure that's what I have. I know it's a 360 and I think it was the smallest storage space when I bought it. It installed just fine once I figured out where it went
yes. It works fine and is easy to install. I purchased one for a friend and installed it for him, and it works fine.
Yes, it is exactly what you need for Battlefield 4.
Yes it will same reason that we purchased it.
Yes, that is exactly what I use mine for
The first picture is not the correct one.
The mouse is about 4 inches wide (thumb to pinky), 5.5 inches long (wrist to pointer), and about 2 inches tall (mouse pad to palm). I would say it is kind of a bigger the average mouse, but I fell in love with it extremely quickly. It is one of the best mice for gaming and I have had 0 issues with its compatibility with World of Warcraft.
It seems the problem is linked to UAC in Windows 7 and is fixed by disabling it at the moment. From the forum posts it seems both steelseries and bioware is aware of the problem and working on a permanent fix.
My first question would be, what game were you using the mouse on? I have found that some games just can't see all the buttons on the mouse, even with the software installed.
Yes it does
Both yellow and grey thumbsticks are included.
It will not. A wobbly stick is caused by the joystick box, the thing you plug the rubber piece into. To fix a wobbly stick you either have to get a new controller or solder a different box on.
It's just one piece.
Extremely easy if you have the right screwdriver. They snap right in. The C stick may seem like it doesn't fit but it does, you just need to apply light pressure until the stick is firmly down. I had never opened up any of my controllers either and replacing four sets of Wavebird sticks took me less than a half hour.
Just one of each color
The game is free to play, it may give you 30 days of 'patron' status, which offers perks and bonuses, none of which is required to play or reach the max level.
I bought this in 2011, and don't remember enough to give you a good answer. Maybe the vendor can give you a better answer. Best of luck to you!
Yes it has everything in the base game plus additional items like a mount
As far as I can understand you can buy this Collector's Edition and add the keycode from the box to your existing account and receive all the different items the Collector's Edition offers. However, if you're only interested in the digital in-game items of this Edition you can upgrade to a Digital Collector's Edition here; https://rift.trionworlds.com/products/view-product?code=RIFT_COLLECTORS_UP_TRION_PRE Hope that helps.
no its just an RPG. But if you're interested in an online RPG there's Elder Scrolls online. You should check it out.
No. You want this version for everything: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Legendary Edition.
You can block on coming attacks with a 2 hand weapon or a shield, and yes there is different wearable items to help regain health, stamina, and magic, plus you can also create different items to help with different parts of the game.
this game is in english and subttles and also just in english. It doesn't have DLC, but it's a huge game, you have a would to explore with a lot of quests. If you need to choose a game to play during the year, this is the game that you will spend a year playing. it's worth buying.
Depends on whats class you choose to be Some times it is slow but when there are dozens of enemies or when a dragon comes or a troll things get a bit crazy
No it doesn't
I've never had a single issue with the game. This is with months and months of nonstop playing. Nothing to worry aboot.
I bought the game about six months after it was released, and there was a large patch available as soon as I installed it. I would imagine that several years later, that's still true and probably a lot more to download.
I haven't had any bugs with it and I bought it recently.
It is both. You can change perspective from your characters eyes, to floating behind and above your character.
My friend has a Mac; had issue's with it and never got it to work. You don't get the game on the DVD to play offline; just the registration software; it downloads the game from "STEAM". You pay for the right to download a file that may or may not work. Personally due to the problem of corrupt file ext: emailed STEAM 5 time to resolve the problem STEAM deleted my account; and my friends problem with "error unable to read" along with problems from 3 other friends that bought this "Not" a Game DVD I don't recommend this game.
Violence is really the only mature content. There is some blood and gore throughout though only with swords, axes, and bows. The worst part is a beheading in the very beginning of the game. The alcohol and sexual themes are very minimal, nothing like grand theft auto.
It gives you unlimited time. The only elder scrolls game that you have to pay a subscription for is The Elder Scrolls Online.
No big deal. Do it and forget about it. No consequences whatsoever. In fact, I don't even remember having to do it.
Yes and it runs very well.
Nexus Mods has a lot of fun additions to Skyrim, including unofficial and comprehensive patches that fix a lot of the bugs. SkyUI, SKSE, FNIS and XP3 Skeleton come highly recommended.
It means that Skyrim runs through the Steam software. If you already have it it'll add the game to your Steam library, if you don't have it it will install Steam on your PC alongside the game.
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a completely standalone game from the rest in the series. The story does not even continue, it's unique in that way. However, if you have played the other Elder Scrolls games, you'll find a few easter eggs here and there. With the bonus of mods, the expansion and re-playability of this game is virtually endless.
I have a Hp pavilion and it works perfect but if you have played it on desktop you might find it wierd because of the distance or lack of but the quality is just the same as on my desktop
Its a downloaded game. It runs through Steam and is very easy to install! You can use Steam for most downloaded games. Its a Great copy
no. the item comes w/ the base for charging the 2 batteries that it comes with. the batteries are for the controllers only, they're pictures in the image for sale. The batteries themselves are inside the plastic backing which is impossible to take apart. hope that helps
Yes
There is a tiny hole in the back of the battery pack. Poke something into it and it will press the red button. Sync as u normally would.
Not long. The light changes colors when fully charged
No you need the remotes
Barely!! If you pull the wrist strap under the controller as if it were a tail coming from the front, it works just fine :)
They turn blue like shown, whn the batter is being charged the lights are red.
i bought it for my daughter for christmas, she just charges the hand held controllers says it works good for them.
i dont know i bought it for my son but it should
No, you need to remove the sleeve to charge. But they batteries once charge do fit with the controller in the silicon sleeve
They only make one version. It will both work with a pc and a ps3.
Yes in every way other than price ;p
I apologize I don't have the link here at the moment. But Sony did confirm that the T500RS, T80, and soon to release T300 are compatible with both PS3 and PS4. The T300 and T80 have switches for PS3 and PS4 modes, as well as Share button for PS4. Even though it doesn't have the PS4 buttons, it is so far the only PS3 wheel that works with PS4.
I don't a PS4 but it works fine with the PS3. It should work just fine.
Course! But they haven't authorized partners there, so you must send it to US or Europe to fix. Anyway, the T500RS is the best for your pocket.
A google search for this answer will be your friend.
Hey bro, the new T500RS is very good, really strong and very quiet. You can trust!
Much better than the T300

GT6 version when I got mine. There is no difference except packaging and different cooling vents on top.
I boug it for the new super mario bros game classic I downloaded works good same. So yes it will work for your game :)
It didn't work at all for me
Yes, however sometimes when you jump you jump at an angle even you didn't position the control stick too
Yep, it should work with classic games you download from the wii shop!
I dont know, look on the back of the case and see what you need
perfectly fine. :)
Yes it does.... the only thing is that you have to plug it into your wii remote... I was kind of hoping it would plug into the wii itself so I wouldn't have to worry about battery life though, ya know? All in all it is a good controller bud. Hope this helps....
A little less than arm's length.
I have never had any problems with mine. Some Wii games won't let you use a controller, but on the ones that do it works as good as my Nintendo one.
Funny this came up. The Classic Controller broke about 5 days ago. A wire broke down next to the connector which is plugged into the regular controller. Just threw it in the trash. I think we had it about 3 or 4 months.
Yes you have to be online

Unfortunately I don't know. I did not download the game, I bought the disc. I don't think it uses steam though but I cant say that with certainty.
I am not a computer expert, but there is no reason why you cannot do what you want. I have not flown Rise of Flight, but Cliffs of Dover with the Team Fusion patches is great. Google Team Fusion CoD to get the info on downloading and installing the patches. It is all free and the forum is very friendly and helpful.
First be sure your PC is up to minimum specification. In fact that specification will only just run it on low settings. Windows 7 is the best OS. Look under your 'My Documents' folder for 1C Soft Club and see that there is an "il-2 sturmovik cliffs of dover" folder there, it is where your personal preferences are stored. If it still doesn't install properly you should register here (harmless, no side issues) and post a question/your problem, it is a very helpful and friendly community:- Register http://theairtacticalassaultgroup.com/forum/forum.php Post questions http://theairtacticalassaultgroup.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=63 Next install the following community patches (1C Maddox Games was closed down but the community is strong): 3.0, 3.01, 4.00, 4.312 You can get them here (no need to register, its open to the public): http://theairtacticalassaultgroup.com/forum/showthread.php?t=10566 Be sure to read the install instructions especially about turning Steam updates OFF. It requires a little effort but is well worth it especially of you want to fly on line with hundreds of other virtual pilots. Good luck.
Its only compatible with 8.1 if you download the 5 "mods" available on "TheAirTacticalAssaultGroup.com" web page. I had no luck what so ever until I downloaded these mods, now the game seems to be running smoother with little or now problems. There's also a "New Pilots" forum that gives you lots of good advice. Good Luck
Not off top of my head.... But google the game and scroll down, it should give you the requirements there
Hi, yes it has force feedback and you need Steam to activate. Make sure you go here for advice on setting up and getting the latest patches. http://theairtacticalassaultgroup.com/forum/showthread.php?t=5058&p=52711

There is no actually mute button on the device. The only way I can think of muting your mic is through the game you are running.

Local multiplayer allows for 4 players, using splitscreen.
Insert disc, press user1or user2,you should see the shape of the controller at the top of the screen with the word'' game' below it ,and you should hear music in the background ,also the image of mator the tow truck , then press X on your controller to start Another way...after seeing the image of Mator,press the triangle button on the controller,then the start button should appear at the middle of the screen then press X on the controller to start
This game play by 2P at a time with 1 screen will be split, good for children eisy to understand
I have not tried. I have a PS3.
Si, esta en espaol Espaa.
the game is good for children and alot of fun
No you don't a ps3 controller works just fine :)
its around 100 grams but why u asking i am not selling any game ?

I play Star Craft: Heart of the Swarm with this mouse, and it is amazing. Very precise. I would highly recommend the Death Adder 2013.
You have to get the a deathadder. If you have the money get the chroma edition.
I'm not going to offer too much detail here since you can read all of the specs and the reviews, but I have been extremely impressed with this mouse. I use it on Linux and it's still highly configurable there with only third-party software controlling it! If you're using this on Windows or Mac then the software is extremely configurable, allowing you to write settings that get stored into the mouse itself (there is a small bit of writable memory where they store it), and even create multiple profiles that you can easily switch between. For example, you can configure a profile for regular desktop use that isn't too sensitive, another profile that is much more sensitive for FPS gaming, and so on. I have had this mouse for a year and it still looks and functions like the day I bought it. I haven't tried a bunch of other gaming mice but I have tried this one and I'm a huge fan.
Yes! Mac OS X 10.6-10.9 should work just fine according to the tech specs on Razer's website - a driver update or two may be required for full functionality.
The original deathadder (blue glowing scroll wheel) but the black editions is just about the same thing (just with no glowing). The old versions use actual drivers. the new 2013 version requires the use of the synapse 2.0 program. You need to create an account and it attempts to connect to the internet. you can disable the auto-connect to internet feature.
We had a similar problem with a non-Nintendo brand remote. You have to open the flap on the front of the wii, press the red button on the wii, release it and then press the button inside the remote. It should start flashing and then light up the as your secondary remote. If your master remote loses it's mind, do the same thing -- press the red button on the wii unit, release it and then press the button inside the remote.

I got the newer one with my order so 2013
Yes it is, but you have to buy the xbox adapter for the xbox one controller.
Yes
Yes comes with everything but you need to have an elite xbox 360 or you have to have an adapter for the plug in the back. I would suggest getting the a40 or 50s though. Much better.
Yep. It works with everything!
On top of your eae
Works with ps3 ps4 pc xbox 360 and xbox one. Check the website for more information :)
yes and no the complete unit reaches over 10-12 feet but the control until goes 1/2 way but you can easily extend the usb that needs to connect to the console
As far as I know it should. Check the astro website though.
Yes it is, but it will need to be plugged into both a USB port and your headphone and microphone jacks.

They sure do. You need to buy the chat adapter though. This one here: http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-One-Stereo-Headset-Adapter/dp/B00IAVDOS6/ref=pd_sim_vg_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=06H2ZR9Z02A1EVARQTFN That's only if you want it to work with chat though. It does work perfectly fine without it, you can just use the kinect for chat if you want to.
Yes, and you can hook it up to multiple systems at once. I have mine connected to my PS4, desktop, and phone.
in your case this isnt the headset you should buy, instead of searching "A40 + MixAmp" search: "A40+ M80" m80 is the adapter for x1 controller. thats all i know :/
Like all headsets there is some bleed if you have it loud enough. However the ear pieces themselves are very dense, so from personal experience, there is very little bleed compared to other headsets. I have not had a single complaint towards that issue, something i pride myself on because I hate hearing someone else's music.
Hi Chris. Yes, but more hardware is required. There is a special adapter/patch-cable that is needed for your controller. I'm not sure why they list these headphones as PC/Xbox/Sony. I have only seen the A40's come in ONE box. There might be a slightly more expensive set that includes the additional part you need. Here is a Youtube link if Amazon allows them- https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=astro+a40+on+xbox+one
It gives/comes with instructions for how to use it with each system, including the 360. I don't believe that you need anything else for any system but the xbox1
The cable is 5 and 4 pole. The purposes of the extra poles isn't clear with the Astros, I've never been able to find the reasoning. The 5 pole connector plugs into the headset, and the 4 pole plugs into the mix amp.
Absolutely, the mix amp pro that comes with it has multiple inputs, you would go straight out of the ps4 optical output into the mix amp pro and the mix amp would send the signal to the headphones, crisp and clear.
You can use a multitude of different connections. I myself am using my optical port.
The headset itself doesn't weigh that much. The entire package comes in a fancy box with the amplifier (for lack of a better term) and a bunch of cables.

The DLC must be bought in the PSN store.
No, it doesn't. Only if you want the online features like the PvP and co-op you will need a internet connection.
I don't think so
The game only has English audio and subtitles (or Japanese if you purchase the Japanese version. There is a multilingual (Spanish) Prepare to Die version of Dark Souls for PC though, if you don't mind buying the game for and playing on a PC. This PS3 version, however, is limited to only English audio and subtitles.
It even comes in the wrapping. I got mine brand new. No problems! It came with everything. No scratches or anything. I recommend it. Its cheaper here than gamestop
To my knowledge, Sony does not region-lock games. I bought this from Canada and live in the States. Here is Wikipedia's answer: "All PlayStation 3 games except for one are region free.[4][5] Even though publishers could choose to region-lock specific games based on a mechanism that allows for the game to query the model of the PS3, none did so during the first six years after the launch of PS3.[6] The first game to be region-locked on PS3 is Persona 4 Arena..." So you should be fine. Enjoy!
It's in British English for all versions. I think you can get the Spanish localization which will have Spanish subtitles. I am not positive though, sorry.
I have known every game I play that when the batteries die the game does not pause. Which, in Dark Souls case, is very inconvenient.
No. But I suggest looking up wikigameguides on youtube. And wildpie101 for walkthrough help.
Yes
I'm not entirely sure, but I have never heard of this game being region locked before. I would assume it is a free region game, so I say it should be safe to play.
Absolutely. It starts up in offline mode when there isnt a psn or xbl gold connection. Very little is lost in terms of functionality; it's a full-function game online and off.
mmm no entiendo si viene en espaol ? disculpen mi estupides

They need to be on the same device, console or pc, as far as I know. Both of mine are on the same.
Yes, you can although the controls are a little different
As far as I remember you have to enter a code and then download the program. Edit: I see from my review I had problems with the file and ended up having to buy a DVD. I wasn't the only one though I don't know how prevalent the problem is now.

I just bought the Wifi Controller for Windows directly from Amazon and it does come WITH the USB transceiver for the PC. Buy it directly from Amazon if you want the transceiver with it.
It does not come standard with a rechargeable battery. You need either 2xAA batteries (which can be rechargeables if you want-I use eneloops myself) or the Microsoft rechargeable battery pack and the play/charge cable.
Vince, If you haven't figured it out yet, you have to pair the controller with your Xbox 360. On the top edge of the controller, between the shoulder buttons, there is a small button with three ))) coming off it. Hold it down until the ring of LED's blink around the controller's guide button, then press the corresponding ))) button on the console (round on the original and Elite models, and a small rectangle right up against the front USB ports cover) so that it also has it's LED ring blinking around the power button. The blinking means they're trying to discover eachother. This works for me, hope it does for you too!
Yep! I have windows 8 and it works great!
yes and no. They recommend buying the wired one and downloading this driver to make it work. http://tattiebogle.net/index.php/ProjectRoot/Xbox360Controller/OsxDriver then buying an app that allows you to map the buttons. I use Joystick Mapper. But I found that a lot of games on steam that says controller support for windows, I had a hard time getting it to work for mac. A lot of trying to figure out what the buttons are, then mapping them.
As it is an XBox 360 controller, it works fine. :)
No, You dont need xbox360 itself. All you need is drivers which comes along with it just install it and you are good to go with most of the PC gaming !! the name itself might be cofusing as controller shape and style is same as native xbox360 controller but it has nothing to do with xbox360 box, yes you can use it on your xbox360 i guess !!! but if wish to use it for PC games, just installed the drivers and wireless USB, put some batteries and you are good to go!!
It should since it acts as a native DirectInput device. I know it works in PCSX2.
Yes, it includes the receiver also.
The one sold by Amazon does. The one sold by GPStock does not. Read my review it explains everything in detail.
The more Dorito dust you cake onto this thing, especially around the analog sticks, the better you will become at Call of Duty. Also you should rinse it off with room temperature, flat Mountain Dew, but only the Gamer Fuel variety.
The official length, according to Microsoft, is 9 feet. See: http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox360/accessories/controllers/xbox360controller But mine is actually 10 feet, but that include the USB break-away dongle that is on the end. The dongle itself adds 1 foot.
It does NOT work or work well with DirectInput (older, legacy, pre-2006) games, only works with XInput games. Before 2006, all PC games used DirectInput API standard for game controllers. Then in 2005, Microsoft implemented the XInput API for Xbox 360, and Windows had to follow and adopted the new Xbox 360 standard. However, the transition process for Windows has been long and gradual: some Windows games from 2013 still used DirectInput, (e.g., BioShock Infinite.) The Xbox 360 controllers do NOT have built-in functionality to work with games that use DirectInput. Sometimes the controllers may work but poorly: the controls are erratic, only partially functional, and/or either too sensitive or insensitive. I found out about the DirectInput vs. XInput problem only after I had tried to use an Xbox 360 Controller to play BioWare's Jade Empire: Special Edition, which was released in 2007 on the PC. Jade Empire used DirectInput. The controller worked only partially: the left joystick (that controls movement) was moving by itself so my game character could not stand still; the right joystick (that controls camera view) and D-pad (for abilities) were non-functional. I went online to look for solutions, and learned about the different DirectInput and XInput API standards. That was when I found a long list of PC games, mostly older titles, that do NOT work or work well with the Xbox 360 controller. The solutions I found were either very technical and difficult to implement, and/or was an additional cost, (e.g., buying a gamepad emulation or profiler app, which usually costs around $10; none of the free ones work well -- I tried;) and/or was inconvenient to use, (e.g., every time I reloaded Jade Empire, I had to unplug and replug in the controller connection for a gamepad profiler to continue to work.) They are just hassles. The problem with Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller for Windows, which none of the other reviewers/fanboys has even bothered to mention, is that it does NOT have a built-in function to work with DirectInput. It may work, but it certainly does not work well or perfectly. The Logitech F310, for example, has a physical switch behind between "D" (DirectInput) and "X" (XInput) methods. The switch should stay on "X" most of the time. However, if you ever run into a DirectInput game, you just switch over to "D". The Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller does NOT have that switch. Microsoft wants developers and users to conform: everyone should stop using DirectInput and adopt XInput, so Microsoft would tell you to "just don't play that game" instead of giving users a real solution. (That's that answer other people got when they called Microsoft to try to get a solution for the DirectInput problem.) If you know you will definitely NEVER touch an old, pre-2006 game that works better with a gamepad or run into one of the odd new games that still uses the old API standard, then this controller may work for you. However, if you do run into a game that uses DirectInput, it will be a lot of frustration and hassle.
Yes actually. My friend had his xbox 360 and one controller and I put in mine and worked perfectly.
No, drivers were instantly downloaded when I plugged the device in, and once automatically configured, the device worked perfectly with all programs.
I can confirm it works with OSX 10.9 using the "tattiebogle" drivers. Feels just as responsive as when playing on the 360.
Worked fine with Windows 8 & 8.1. Didn't ask for any drivers
No, the PC version of Minecraft does NOT support controllers like this, however there are mods available that add support. Do a Google search with the following terms to quickly find info "Xbox Controller PC site:minecraftforum.net" That is the official Minecraft forum, so it is trustworthy and heavily patrolled for malicious content. Be sure to read some of the comments before downloading something, though, just to be safe.
I use is for all my games from the original nintendo to playstation 2 and I think it is great
I do not believe so, unless the game has controller support, the analog sticks do not take the place or act as a mouse in any situation. This could vary widely on the game, but in most cases this answer will be no.
If you do this, you're gonna receive the code on your email, from Amazon. Then, you just have to write the code on PS.
im from Guatemala but my account its from US, so the thing is that your account must be created in US Region to this to work.
The ps plus you buy from amazon only work you if you're a user of united states, mexico and canada, and also if you think an American Profile, will ask for a credit card in the American region, you will not serve use your card charging credit of portugal. I've tried it in my country and 17 dollars were thrown away, if someone wants I can change for the $ 10 ps gift card
Not, you dont need an american credit card. Buy it and actvate it.
Yes
Unfortunately no.
How can fix
Yes it can work if you are using the US PSN account. You just need a US address. The key/ code will be email to you straight, and you can redeem it online or through the PSN store. I'm staying in Asia and using the US PSN account.
If you use the same used on both, yeah
If you are using the same PS account, it doesn't matter which system you use, you always have the PS Plus benefits, but beware since you have a numbered of systems and consoles allowed to each account.

How can fix
Yes it can work if you are using the US PSN account. You just need a US address. The key/ code will be email to you straight, and you can redeem it online or through the PSN store. I'm staying in Asia and using the US PSN account.
If you use the same used on both, yeah
If you are using the same PS account, it doesn't matter which system you use, you always have the PS Plus benefits, but beware since you have a numbered of systems and consoles allowed to each account.
If you do this, you're gonna receive the code on your email, from Amazon. Then, you just have to write the code on PS.
im from Guatemala but my account its from US, so the thing is that your account must be created in US Region to this to work.
The ps plus you buy from amazon only work you if you're a user of united states, mexico and canada, and also if you think an American Profile, will ask for a credit card in the American region, you will not serve use your card charging credit of portugal. I've tried it in my country and 17 dollars were thrown away, if someone wants I can change for the $ 10 ps gift card
Not, you dont need an american credit card. Buy it and actvate it.

Nope. You get free and discounted games as a PS plus member
It will be sent by email. Should be good as long as you are using it on a US account.
You don't have to buy the physical card. You can purchase the digital code. When you get the code you can enter it directly on your ps4.
This will automatically populate your screen with the code that you can copy down after purchase. The code will also be available to view in your account if you ever want to see it again.
You must hace a US address in order to buy it
It works with my USA PSN account
It only works in US PSN accounts...
Hi you can buy any code gift you want any time simply add to your card by Amazon payments but must your account be a USA
i think you cant use the card cause it is only for USA accounts. you can sell it and buy another card from your country. also you can create a psn USA account to use the card

It is not linked to amazon. They email You the code and then you can give that code to anyone you want
Once you complete your purchase you can view the code in your browser.
Hmmm I think you do, but also I think that they don't verify that in this kind of purchases (digital ones)
Just so I'm clear, you bought a $20 PSN code on Amazon but when you try to redeem it on the PSN store it says that it is no longer valid. Try going to the online PSN store here: https://store.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/#!/en-us/home/games , after signing it with you PSN ID click on your account name in the upper-right of the screen and go to redeem code. Try doing a copy/paste from the code Amazon gave you. You'll have to copy/paste the 3 parts separately, xxxx-xxxx-xxxx, the PSN store won't let you do all 12 characters at once. If that doesn't work try contacting Playstation Customer Support here: https://support.us.playstation.com/app/contact_options
You can use your payment of choice to purchase this Gift Card. If you are unsure what your payment mode is I suggest checking your 1-Click Order settings to verify. All of my purchases of this where using my credit card, and never had a problem.
Yes, you can.
No, tenes que crear una cuenta en estados unidos para poder usar la gift card ! Saludos desde Guatemala !
If you are using Amazon app you will get an email if not there will be a pop up with your code
if its an amazon gift card redeem it on your account. it will tell you that you need a credit card to set up one click payment when you go to buy the playstation card. once thats done when you go to pay it takes the funds from the money you redeemed on the gift card.
I think it would not work. Just add your credit card information to your Mexican PSN account and you should be fine.

I had about one month left on my subscription when I bought another year subscription - and it just added that time on, so you should be able to do the same.
of course u can. in this very moment i am in Argentina and i have my PS4 whit me, and i playing BF4.
You will receive an email with the link for the code and once you get it give it to the person you want and that's all to it. Very simple painless process. Great gift for a gamer as well.
If you buy a PS commonly they will give you 1 or 3 free months, it depends on the promotion, it is included on the bundle, but it will expire then you will not be able to play some games, this code will give you a full year, you can use it when your subscription expire.
When you redeem the code on the PS4
Yes
I Suggest you to create a new PSN account, but instead of creating the account in Egipt, create it as a US account. this way you can get the best free games and you wont have any problem. in my case, I'm from Argentina, and my PSN Account is from the US
As many as you want

Yes.
Aye to both.
Did you install Steam? To register Rocksmith program you will need to install steam. Installation of steam should have been included on Rocksmith.
Yes it should work fine with those specs.
yes! If you already own Rocksmith you can get an upgrade to Rocksmith 2014 Edition - "No Cable Included" Version Does NOT include the required Rocksmith Real Tone Cable. Intended for players that already have the cable. Platforms: Xbox 360, PlayStation3 system, PC/Mac (Download only) Price: $59.99 at Rocksmiths website.
Supply your own.
No, this first edition is only for pc. If you want to use on a mac then you have to get rocksmith 2014 edition, that one is mac or pc. I will tell you this make sure your mac and or pc meants games requirements. I have both editions and my mac doesnt meet requirements. I had to upgrade a pc. Hope that helps. I love both editions.
Yes. I'm currently using Rocksmith and Rocksmith 2014 on Windows 8.
New song list and some tweaks to the game play. For some the changes will be superficial, but for some they are significant (like the ability to set the difficulty level). see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocksmith_2014
I got the cable. Everything was included with my purchase.
Not sure! I gave it to my son for a christmas gift. He was able to use it right away without having to go purchase cables or anything. They love it.
Yamaha has an amazing 3/4 size acoustic that plugs in.
Yes it does!!
As long as you buy a second cord for the guitar, you should be able to play with two people and two separate guitars.
yes
All ages can play this game. When in game play the game will adjust it's difficulty automatically to a level comfortable enough for the player.
Yes
I think you can use it with or without internet
Any guitar, or bass, that will plug in can be used.
Just the 3DS, not the 3DSXL.
It comes with the base and battery.
I would assume so, as it is simply a bigger battery. Make sure you use the correct adapter for charging.
No just the 3DS
The base is just a convenience, it can charge through the normal charging port still. I have this and have very much enjoyed it, the only thing that is not perfect about this is that the 3DS says it has a low battery after the same amount of time as the normal battery would have. So it will say it has low battery, but still has around 60-70% left
No it's not the same arrangement as the 3DS so it won't fit
I highly doubt it. The size of the battery isn't the same, therefore it won't fit properly.
yes,it comes with Powerpak and base. Thanks,
You can play with the 3DS while charging. (For me, the only way to charge it at all is to leave it powered on.) I've done it a couple times. However, it would be a little weird if you're holding it because you would have to make sure that it stays charging and you don't move it a certain way to stop it from charging. It is possible to charge it, but for me it is a little weird when holding. However, instead of holding it, you could also leave it laying flat on the table, desk, where ever you placed it to charge. But yes, it is possible to play it while charging.
yup, it comes with both
Yes it does. My son has a 3DS and uses this one.
More as a backup in a hotel, or to keep at grandmas house kind of thing, my grand children are always forgetting theirs so, there is one here now, and I will get one for the cottage too probably.
Yes, I think it works.
We've had this charger for about 3+\- months & have had no problems with it.
We use ours on the original
It's not anywhere near as long as the one that comes with the 3DS. This one is about two and a half feet shorter than the one that came with the 3DS.
think charger the cord wasn't the normal size that you get with a ds it was short you have to sit really close to the outlet
Yes. It's great for all ages. They just have to make sure they're responsible enough to keep their sims alive.
Yes
Yes. This just an add on
Yes
Yes
No. One of the least violent expansion packs, imo. No new deaths, no violent actions that I can think of.
Yes, and the schools and extracurriculars are specified towards your Sim's goals (ballet, military school, science club).
Yes
Yes. They used to be separate games, but now they all work on both platforms
SIM's 3 works on WIN 7..... I have no idea it working on WIN 8..... sorry :)

Yes it does. Just load up the virtual Wii menu, and it will show up in the "Launch Disc Software" area.
It looks like it takes the same games.. It should be able to.. My niece has a wii u and my wii resorts game works just fine :)
The wii motion plus has the adapter. If you have newer or 3rd party controllers that already have it, then you don't need the +. If you don't, then get some after market controllers that do, since the + adapter sticks out of the controller.
Yes. One motion plus for each controller.
I've bought many used games...these were Christmas presents so I bought new. Never bought a bad used game.
If you google this question, the answer says yes. There are steps to follow, best to google this answer before deciding to buy this game.
You can return it for a full refund.
Yes sports resort has the hard case. Wii sports has a cardboard sleeve.
No
No, it did not come with the adaptor.

Mostly running. Not nearly as much stopping as some of the other recent (bad)games. All in all they pretty much got it right here and it pretty much runs smoothly the entire game. Not much story (nothing like sonic adventure) and not so many annoying enemies. A great game!
Hi Adam, NO, this game is for only 1 player.
..If you have a ps3..I don't see why not
Actually this is kind of like a compilation of a few levels from all generations of Sonic games, though it includes classic Sonic the hedgehog as an unlockable. If you are looking for classics id recommend Sonic Genesis Collection on PS3 I dont hace it yet but I've read it has all of the genisis classics including Sonic and Knuckles.
Yes
only on ps3/ 360
I do not know I bought it as a Christmas gift for my kids so they haven't played it yet.
PS4 is not backwards-compatible with PS3 disc-based games. They are planning to offer bunch of PS3 titles streaming, however, through Playstation Now.

Yes. I can use it with my PS4. Not my XBOX1 though.
yes, you will need 2 outlets. 1 for the G155 and 1 for your gaming system
yeah xbox 360 is compatible with this !
it depends on the seller if he or she has everything. i brought a really used up one but it works great and it came with everthing except hd cables.
Yes ur doors that is what my kids use. And best gift ever two years and still in great working condition
Only a customizable center badge, according to the description in the sentry listing. That description lays out the difference between all three.
Yes, it does.
Its pretty much a portable tv in a case. You can hook up an x box 360
I would say it wont work with the PS2 however I did find this quote online at reviews.gamestop.com and this is what it said with regards to the PS2. "have to buy a HDMI to VGA converter if you want to play PS2". Hope that helps you.
no not if you dont need to

no not if you dont need to
NO
No
No
Sorry but I use the mouse as the game is real simple and aircraft respond well to the mouse.
Yes it will i have windows 7 on both my alienware laptops and it works on both
I do not have a dongle for it, but it does not have it's own power source.
It connects via mini usb cable (what ti 84 uses), and i have used it for gameboy/snes emulators successfully.
They basically work on any emulator that you can remap your controls to. I have not once had a problem using it with any emulator.
Yes, it did for me on my Asus tf300t. I love how tiny it is.
I couldn't get it to work, period, and sent it back for a refund. Hope yours works better than mine did (I was trying to use it with a MacBook Pro) and that someone will be able to advise you.
My experience with it is that it doesn't work..period. I would go with a different controller.
No it will not. It it only supported by PC and Mac.
Yeah! You can play the campaign without an internet connection! :D
According to Steam, under support, Windows Vista is listed as compatible OS
Yes
Yes. It comes with steam.
Yes, when you put the disc in it registers through steam.
I do! I have spoke with a few people that still play, so I suppose the answer is yes! I see there is multiplayer on the menu however, I have hughsnet as my provider so with my present provider it is not possible to game on line.
Depends on your graphics card and cpu, yet i would not recommend windows 8 for gaming purposes
The whole complete process is about 2 hours depending on internet speed and laptop
Yes ... it will run on Xp, Vesta and Windows 7. The better your video card the better the graphics
You could purchase a USB optical drive. It would be just as much as the download, but you could buy the discs in the future at a lower price. Otherwise you have to pay the pc download.
Yes and no. They're different versions of the same exact game. They each have some minor, version exclusive content that the other game does not. This is to encourage player interaction and sharing. But you are not missing out on anything if you get one version and not the other.
The story is not wholly dependent upon the story of Black/White version. There are a handful of things that may make more sense, but nothing particularly necessary to enjoying the game.
The 3DS can play DS games with no issue.
We got the black version and no Spanish
Yes
No it will not because of the multiple changes
Please elaborate your question. Matter how so? I've been playing the US versions for over a decade with no problem
Yes
Yes, that what my grandchild has.
Yes, all DS games are also playable on the 3DS.

You can use the Gamepad, Pro Controller and even the Wii Remote and Nunchuk combo.
For the main "Story" part of the game, it is a single player. That part is NOT co-op. There are Missions and Bingo Battle that are two player. My husband and I are addicted to playing the Missions which are co-op and very fun.
It is compatible with it however I have not personally used it with one (because it is easier to point and aim with a wiimote, I think).
Game is out of print
unlikely. Originally Nintendo said that Gamecube controller would be supported by anything that uses a pro controller, but they updated later that it would only be supported with Smash. They might change their mind again, but currently the answer is no.
Honestly it does not make a difference. There are a few references to one and 2 that you might not 'get', but I don't think you'll miss anything major. Many mechanics are new or changed and everything you'll need to know is explained in game (or left as a puzzle for you to solve, obviously).
It very well could be. The controls for the game aren't very complicated, but the premise of the game can be. I would recommend Pikmin for kids in the 7-12 range due to the problem solving aspects as well as the impending frustration from some of the tougher parts of the game. If she's a problem-solver and has good hand eye coordination, it might be worth a shot! Plus, you could always play it too and it is definitely a really fun game. I'm 28 and I love it.
Nintendo doesn't like money
It's because there is not a supply of them in the U.S. It's a very rare to find one new at a store anywhere.
It's a very rare game that's out of production

Yes, my Wii Remote and nun-chuck works great on the Wii U and is one of the main alternative controlling options for most Wii U games.
Yes you can. Wii U is backwards compatible and plays all Wii games. It is also compatible with all Wii controllers and accessories.
I know this is an old question, but it's voted high, so for future reference, you can't use an SD card to store Wii U data, but you can easily use an external hard drive, or even a flash drive/memory stick for Wii U data storage.
Sorry for the late response. Yes indeed you can! All you need is a Wii console, at least one Wii Mote, and SD card and of course, a Wii U console. You can find videos of the process on You Tube. I plan on transfering downloaded games from my Wii to Wii U soon. Good luck!
the "8gbs" is really just for stuff you download so unless you download all your games, it should not be a problem
Console, controller, hdmi cord, power cable, sensor bar. No games.
Same reason I bought it, the black ones also attract oil build up really easily. Anyways yes you can survive quite easily. I just have a USB 64gb flash drive hooked up but you can go as high as a terabyte portable HDD. Happy gaming &#128077;
It is not backwards compatible with gamecube games, only Wii games. A GameCube game would probably break your Wii u. Most of the original wiis are GameCube backwards compatible with GameCube controller ports. The controller, not unless you have the GameCube controller adapter
Yes the game pad has a red case on it.
It's the wii only without the skylanders swap force bundle
Yes, my Wii Remote and nun-chuck works great on the Wii U and is one of the main alternative controlling options for most Wii U games.

It does. It is the same thing as a 3DS but bigger. That's the only main difference. Also you can play with the depth of the 3D effect to adjust it to whatever you like it to be.
All the 3ds should come with an sd memory card.
Firmware Version - If you are talking about the current firmware update for the 3DS family, as of 10/19/2014 it's 9.0.0-20 U for people in the Americas region. If you are buying a 3DS it may not be up to date. Copyright - should be 2012-2014 (soon to be 2015!)
Yes, my purchase had come with the cards.
Yes or 2ds
No, the feature in the bottom of the system was taken away as the DSi was Relased, and wasn't added onto the 3DS
No.
I believe the eShop is part of the 3DS. I have a different color, but it still has the application that lets me go into the eShop.
The mail has already been picked up at the house today. There's still an hour before the post office closes, I am pretty available right now so I can drop it off within that timeframe if you order now and your order does not go into a pending state(I have no control over pending states, usually it's waiting for credit card verification or things like that). However at this point it is not likely to get there by Christmas anyway, the post office has been moving slowly and I do not ship via overnight shipping methods. If you live within a state of Georgia there is a better chance it may get there before Christmas. Anyhow, that is the best I can do for you and I hope that answers your question. I need at least 30 minutes to pack it up and get there and it's 4pm here right now. Post office closes at 5.
This is a suitable gift for children. It has parental controls so you can limit what she does, such as browsing the Internet. 3ds Internet has Safe Browsing enabled. You can buy games online, or buy the cartridges. I would suggest buying games online, so your child doesn't accidentally lose or damage their game. The cartridges are a bit small and easy to lose track of if not taken care of. Also if you lose your stylus, you can order new ones for cheap. Those are also easy to lose.
This game is basically completely different than The Last of Us. Beyond Two Souls was made by the same company who made Heavy Rain. It's heavily story based and you follow a plot through cut scenes and situations where you can decide how to interact with the environment. You do not fight monsters or enemies except in scripted fight scenes where you select the right buttons to use. You don't have weapons either. This isn't a shooter game its an interactive drama action-adventure video game also called a movie game. Basically you play a movie.
Someday hopefully. But on ps3 I think it may only be 720p 3D. ps4 may be even better 1080p 3D. So how does it look in 3D?
The term "puzzle" for this game I think is used a bit loosely. There are questions you will develope while playing the game because something seems amiss or just not entirely clear, but are answered as you progress. When they say "puzzle" it's probably more along the lines of "how do I want to define my character?". The choices you make during the game, whether verbally or physically, will alter the story and relationships later on. Example: a scene where people are mean/abusive to you. You can choose to seek revenge or let it go. I'm not sure if you remember these, but there were "choose your own adventure" storybooks. You were given a scenario and each choice you made had a different outcome.
Yes
Hi Shelly, thats right, this isnt the special edition, its the standard one. And yes, special edition has steel box...
I did not see Spanish on my game. Sorry
it has subtitles
No. The audio is in English and french, and the subs also. The spanish version is only sell in Spain.
I did not have one in mine either but I don't really see the need for it. I never look at them anyways.
No mi amigo, el que venden en Estados Unidos y Europa solo viene en voces y subtitulos en ingles y frances, el que viene en espaol latino es el especfico para latinoamerica, una sea que he visto (tengo las dos versiones) es que el que est en ingles dice en la caratula "only on Playstation", mientras que el espaol latino obviamente dice lo mismo pero en espaol.
I use it for only Netflix and it works for that.
No, it doesn't work with the PS4. This is the entry from the list of compatible accessories (link provided): PlayStation Media / Blu-ray Disc Remote Control - PS4 supports CEC (HDMI Direct Link) and can use your TV's Remote. http://community.us.playstation.com/t5/PlayStation-Peripherals-Support/List-of-Compatible-PS3-Accessories-for-PS4-Updated-2-7-2014/td-p/40831841
No. The unit will only work with the ps3 and some other sony products.
Not sure. I wasn't aware that there was in app volume control for Netflix. I have programmed the control to my T.V., so I just adjust the volume on my T.V. as needed. The control has all of the buttons your PS3 control has and then some to do things such as slow motion or bookmarks, ect. in one touch of a button. However it does not have the joysticks but it does have the "R3" and "L3" buttons. It also can be programmed to your amp as well. You can also change the audio and subtitle settings at the touch of a button. I hope this helps.
Mine always blinks 3 times the first time I turn it on. ..have you synced it to YOUR PS3 yet ?
It should work with all apps on the PS3. If you are trying to use the app on a machine other than the PS3, than this controller will not work for it.
Unfortunately it does not.
Don't think that it will. According to the manual, it's only able to operate the PS3, supported TVs and Sony-only AV amps.
Maybe it states it will only work with Sony equipment, I don't have the specific instructions with me though
I would say most likely not. In the instructions you are supplied tv codes to program remote. There's a scan option to find the code for the but I highly doubt that'd work with a projector.
I'm sorry I cannot answer...kids do not have this game.
Yes, and navigator too.
Hey man, I dont know for that game. Actually I use the wheel for play little big planet karting and I use two. One for me and one for my daughter and works great. Sorry if i dont answer your exactly question.
Yes.
Compatible.
Yes
no
Yes, very well.
you may be to close to the camera... i had the same issue, also check the setting on the lens, wide or narrow view it will make a difference on how far you are sitting. hope this helps. have a happy easter
no it is only xbox 360 compatible.
It is single player but if you posses xbox live you can play with friends
Just one. :(
You don't need Xbox Live.
No
Yes I believe so.
No
PC is basically a case with the PC disc. PC download, well I've done GTA 4 on PC download on my powerful laptop and it took more than a week do download. You'll stand a better chance buying it other than PC, just graphic and smooth gameplay wise.
In my experience, I say yes, it is. No way its not. After around ten years of need for speed gaming, I'm into it now. Have you ever tried any NFS games? Because I think you might want to reconsider on this one. I've tried it before and the steering response is a little late and challenging. I'm just saying. However, the other ones Like Underground 1 % 2, Most Wanted (2005), Carbon, Undercover, Hot Pursuit (2010), World (Online), Rivals (2013) are better than this one. Give any of them a go. You'll like it.

I think to be on Spanish u have to downdo far is in English
Disk
If you're asking about language settings in the game. They have a language pack that comes on the second disk (xbox 360 version). So you just have to download it and change the settings then.
The xbox 360 version comes with a two disks. The first disk is the game, the second disk is alternate langauges.
Yes, there are two discs. Disc 1 is the installation disc. Disc 2 is the "play" disc, meaning you have to have it in the X-Box while you are playing the game.
I've always bought new games but if I did buy a preowned game I would make sure they had a great review from them positive feed hope this helps
I would say no, I really didn't know how bad it was until I started playing it. The language and sexual references and actual sexual content, I feel make this game much worse than a rated R movie. The game itself and free play world are amazing, I wish you could edit the other stuff out.
Yes
8gb is required to play the game. I would get this for a 11yr old. My daughter is 13 and I just bought it for her. I think as long as the children who play this game knows right from wrong and is respectful, then it should be okay. I would buy the game from Xbox store instead of amazon. My daughters game only worked 1 day. Now I have to buy her another one. I could of returned it for an exchange of a new one but she threw away the box and label.
No because, there is less to do on Assassin's creed. It also has a smaller area than GTA V where as GTA V has a huge world with variety of gameplay. But this is just my opinion and I feel that kids and young teenagers should buy Assassin's creed due to GTA V having a lot of profanity in it. If GTA could tone that down then GTA V is for me a 100% fun time.
I don't know seems pretty cheap when I bought it I thought it was fake or something but I took a risk and everything seems pretty good works great runs great I've had no problems good game and good deal
This is made for USA made consoles. So it probably wouldn't work for any other country.
I would think of it this way. You should play it with your boy and explain things along the way. Just like would you let them watch Road warriors the movie by them selves or with you watching it with them.
No it just needs a disc to run the game.
Yes. It comes with both.
Yes
At the moment, the PlayStation 4 will only play PS4 games. Unless Ubisoft Montreal decides to make a PS4 version of this game, which is unlikely being that they are currently working on the production of newer Assassin's Creed titles, this game will only be playable on the PlayStation 3.
The one l bought came in a Clear Case not that Greatest Hits.
Mine came in the actual box.
Si, it has subtitles both in English and Spanish
NO.
Yes
Hate to break it to you but you won't find ezio or Altair in these games. There stories are done. But I would recommend you do not skip. Get this first than that so you will understand what's going on. However I would get brotherhood and revelations before this one so you know what's going on in 3
Unfortunately, it doesn't...just English as default language.
As they are two different model numbers, I doubt it
Yes. very good quality sound
It does not interfere with wifi, wifi interferes withe the rf signal from the box to the headset.
sort of i guess, depends on what you are using it for. It has the ability to take 2 different sound sources. One from the wireless adapter it comes with and then it can also connect via bluetooth or the small 2.5mm jack used by xbox controllers. Though honestly i would avoid this as mine has broken so many time from just wearing them, the bluetooth has always sounded like crap (the one you use for its mic and voice chat) and always had the main sound cutting in and out while right next to the base station.
It come wit everything. It is good for the price (:
I haven't tried...but if your PC has the correct audible out jack it should, no problem.
Yes, it works awesomely and on my 64bit system to boot! And the better the graphics card, the better and more graphics you will be allowed to view in game, i.e. you can download a special expansion graphics pack that makes things nearly real life. So, get it, and enjoy!
It actually uses Origin instead of Steam. The Origin client and an origin account are required to play though.
It should, however if your system is using xp and you are having problems running the game, the problems are more likely to be hardware related. Too little ram or not enough power in you video card. This game is intensive on older systems.
i believe so, i ran it on 7, but have heard that all the 8 & 8.1 versions can run in an emulator mode for older versions if you need...it may run fine as is. have fun, it was a good game.
Apparently you get the bow earlier in the game and a few other features, which didn't mean a lot, honestly I only bought the Hunter's edition because it was pretty much the same price as the regular edition, but if there is a cheaper version of the original $10 or so cheaper, I would say that is a batter choice.
Not that I'm aware of. The other consideration is the violence. There isn't tons of gore, but the nature in which you eliminate enemies can be pretty graphic and intense depending on the maturity level/age of the player.
im using win 7
Yes
Yes. Crysis 3 has a public multiplayer option available and all platforms.
Yes, if you have a USB enabled XBOX(360/1) Controller. The game supports Game Controllers(USB Paddles,Console Controllers) with 360 Controls built in. - Although your accuracy will be much lower than mouse controls due to not having aim-assist in the PC Version.
No
Yes
Yes. All DLCs are just extra maps and game modes for multiplayer and has no effect on the gameplay itself
yes they do and here is a website that you can check out all the car that you can get.................... http://www.ign.com/wikis/forza-horizon/Vehicle_List
Yes
Upon searching game facts for Forza Horizon, we found that you can upgrade cars but cannot tune cars. Thank you kindly and have a great day.
Yes
This information is estimated as it would also be based on the time your order is placed Order Date: March 5, 2015 Expected Ship Date: Mar 6, 2015 to Mar 9, 2015 Estimated Delivery: Mar 11, 2015 to Mar 16, 2015 Shipping Service: Standard Thank you kindly and have a great day
Yes
No, sadly the horizon series doesn't have this, only forza 3,4 & 5.
Yes
Yes
No the second game has better graphics and better cars.
It is the actual physical box copy of the game
Do not buy this. It comes with the World of Warcraft Standard Edition now: http://www.amazon.com/World-Warcraft-PC-Mac/dp/B00FRESQYG/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1417828535&sr=8-5&keywords=world+of+warcraft "Includes Expansion Packs: The Burnings Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, Cataclysm, and Mists of Pandaria"
No, only with starter pack
Ofcourse :)
I am sorry I do not understand your question. You need the game mailed to you to play it. It's not like some software that you can use a code to play.
Basically, this just unlocks additional game play for the WoW series, you'll still need the starter pack and pay for gameplay either with a credit card attached to your battle.net account or with game cards purchased at a store. It is $30 every two months for gameplay access (so basically $15 per month to play).
Sorry, I do not ship international. Regards, Kelilarc's Shoppe
Yes, they have it separated by region (US, Euro, Asian/Pacific, etc.) so that people can play w/the same languages and time zones.
No, that's for the purchase of the new expansion that is coming in december.
You HAVE to have internet. You can play solo, but other people will be there and, if offline, you cannot play.
Yes this is US version
No art work, but the map is there
Yes
I have not had any problems. It works great. Is yours freezing?
It works for all PS3s in the world no matter what country
No mam it's not but they is completely up to the parent
I bought about a month ago and it works great. Play nearly every day and i have cloned my system to an SSD. No problems.
Maybe if you switch the language on your ps3, don't know otherwise
Im not following your question.
It is not and "Only" online game. You may play the single player missions and/or play online multiplayer games.
Hello. Did you purchase this item from us? If so, please send us a private e-mail with your Order # and I will forward to the warehouse for response. Kind regards, IWD
Hello. Did you purchase this item from us? If so, please send us a private e-mail with your Order # and I will forward to the warehouse for response. Kind regards, IWD
Yes, this game does include the physical disc in the case. It is your preference if you would like to own a physical copy of the game, or download a version to play.
The game is on the disc. You install it from there, but it will need to download and install whatever patches came out after the disc was made.
Yes! Regards, IWD
Yes.
You have the option of choosing between mouse and keyboard or gamepad. Xbox controller is generally the default gamepad for pc games that support gamepads. But if you learn to use the mouse and keyboard scheme for games like this you'll never want to go back.
You don't need Steam. You will need UPlay. I believe even if you download it via Steam, you still need UPlay.
No
Not well, you can use it driving but there are buttons missing to walk around so you can't walk without switching controllers :(
Just like on the Xbox's main controllers, there is a connectivity button that needs to be pressed (on the back in the center of the wheel). So as you would with the main controller's press the button on the wheel that makes the lights show that they are searching for the console, and then press the small circular button on the console that is near the power button. Once they have become in sync with one another, the controller will flash a few times and then tell you which user the wheel is (ie 1, 2, 3, or 4). If this didn't help answer your question, https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/wireless-speed-wheel
There are different settings to choose from. I set mine to use the up and down buttons on the D Pad (in the picture, it's located on the top left of the controller). I think you can choose to use the "Y" and "A" buttons as well and I don't remember what other options there were. Probably "X" and "B" would work.
Will not work with forza. It 'does' but this controller doesn't have the right and left bumper buttons, making gear shifting and other functions impossible
Yes
Very good
AA batteries. Understand that it doesn't support gear changing or clutch, so you'll have to work in Automatic shifting mode. It does make driving Forza 3 and 4 a lot more fun, however, and once you get used to driving with the triggers as throttle and brake, it gets to be pretty easy to do and is a lot more like driving than a basic controller.
You might be able to play a few games but not too many. Minecraft isnt one of them. The controller does not have left or right bumps and the left and right sticks. Its mainly just for racing. I cant do EVERYTHING on froza 3. To fine tune my cars i have to use a regular controller. The racing wheel has GREAT response to racing games though. I was very impressed.
Yes
Absolutely. I recommend that you play the story mode of Halo 4 first because this will help you become familiar with the controls. It will also introduce you to all of the weapons and vehicles
No, sir. That would prove impossible. Halo is available only for Microsoft XBOX 360. I would vote to have it on my iPad, though I'd guess Microsoft would have a fit if their competitor were to posses their precious game. Hope this helps!
"Mature" do to the killing
no single player you can do locally from your house but to do multiplayer you will need a online live card, *Online multiplayer and Spartan Ops missions require Xbox LIVE Gold membership (sold separately).
Yes, 2 players Co-op.
I don't remember it being gory. I play (try) the horror games that are really gory and gross though. I think there is some blood but not major. Again, I haven't played it much and my daughter isn't too happy when I play with her because I always end up killing her. I think it should be rated T instead of M because it really isn't that bad from what I seen when I watch her play. My daughter is 20 now but she has had all of the Halo games. It is a shooter game, so there is violence and some blood...but I would not classify it as extreme as the COD games (Call of Duty). I just talked to my daughter and she said it's not gory.
If you are refering to a xbox live trial, then yes, or at least it did when I bought it.
As long as you pay your monthly subscription to Xbox live you can play online.
No.
Standard game. Comes with campaign and multiplayer (includes online). Standard just means no DLC included, nothing extra.
I picked up the story after a few minutes. They pretty much flash back the entirety of the first two games. The story however isn't really that relevant to the game play.
If you take the game seriously and don't run through it like an idiot then it should last you about 7 1/2 hours, by that i mean, using cover, scanning around, using some stealth, thats how much time i got
Yes, for most of the game play it does.
SADLY NO, perhaps but its only when you killed online like in battlefield
Very little....you can handle it.
Yes, the hunter edition looks and plays better than what you see.
No code need since ea stopped that policy' I thought you meant predator edition extra code. No you don't need it because ea stopped that policy so that means any ea game is playable without a code.
Crysis 3 has a single player campaign and has multiplayer which you can battle others online.
Not the regular game. I am not sure if the XBox live version is. I do not have XBox live.
Yes it does just that the lobbies are pretty empty now. Not a lot of people play the multiplayer anymore but you can get lucky to meet a few players there. You can also arrange games with your friends who have the game too. Hope it helps.
Yes I find Borderlands 2 enjoyable single & multi-player.
If you want to follow along the story lines and understand who the characters are in boardlands 2 then I would say yes. If you would like to just jump both feet into a game and start blazing away then no. If I had never played the first borderlands before playing the second it would be just as enjoyable.
They all have their strengths, it really comes down to how you want to play and who you think looks the coolest. Do you want to start as the quick elemental sorceress, the robot assassin, the jacked and crazy bezerker, or the more standard, but very adaptable soldier? And, each one allows a good amount of playstyle customization as you go. That's not even bringing up the downloadable mechromancer and psycho... Or you can just start one of each and try them all out!
I'm not quite sure, since i haven't purchased any if its DLCs, but gamerfaq.com might be of assistance. Hope it helps!
Well I never had a PS3 before but from my experience with friends and other people the Xbox is better. While the ps4 is good, the Xbox is better then the PS3. I am not 100% sure on what makes the PS3 better or worse then Xbox, but if you Are asking my opinion, buy the Xbox.
If you want the updates then you have to hook it in. But there really isn't updates at this point. There is one update as soon as you play to play online, I am pretty sure you need to be online. But playing online is5 really that different then offline, the only difference is obviously more players, but the enemies get stronger.
I believe so, but I am not sure.
Yes.
Plenty of violence -- blood, gunshot wounds, heads being blown off, hatchets, etc. Some sexual innuendo, but nothing too blatant (at least so far -- I haven't completed the game).
Not this version. There may be a spanish version available though.
I believe LTO mean " Limited Time Offer"
It is the game itself and inside the cover you will find the code for the first map pack so you can download it for free. Not sure what LTO means, you can just google that and you'll find out.
Sorry I'm out of town.
Yup, mine came with a working DLC code. Just make sure your buying from a buyer with a good rating.
Yes it is
The Maps that come standard are KINO, DEAD OPS ARCADE, and FIVE. Also with the 1st map pack 'First strike ' included here, are an additional Zombie map called Ascension.
im not sure but its not that long of a game. mine froze after playing for an hour!
Yes, you can play Zombies and Multiplayer online.
It just came with ascension bundle. Guessing limited time offer I could be wrong ;)
no way this is a ps3 version ONLY, its a great great game, but violent
Yes. This comes with a free DLC code as we'll.
No pack, however it does have a zombies node ready to play when you start.
Yes
It comes with first strike. Still a better deal than paying full price for that map pack and buying a different game that doesn't come with it.
It was bought for my grandson. It was the actual game
yes
M means mature content Violence's and graphic language this game has both
Yes it is.
I would not recommend this game for anyone under 18 years old because of the language and violence. Yes, it is a military based game but that doesn't mean a child should be playing it.
It will work but it is only 1000 mA. That is smaller than the 1800 mA they came with your system. Almost all the replacement batteries are 1800 mAh. This will only hold a charge about half as long as the battery that came with your system. It will work, but you will probably regret paying twice as much for half the battery. Like I do.
Yes. This battery works in 2000 and 3000 series PSP's. The Lenmar battery is also the one I would recommend. It has been very reliable and was also pretty cheap. Also be sure to update the OS to the final release (version 6.60) especially if you decide to jailbreak your PSP. That way you won't need a pandora battery to install nploader or whatever alternate os you decide to use.
It plays fine for me after a full charge, although I don't play it very long at a time. Probably 2 hours max play time. I did drain it fully the first time after I charged it fully - and it took over 2 hours to drain, but I only turned off all power save features, and was not using any network. My complaint with the battery is that it drains when NOT in use. So, I have it fully charged, and then 2 weeks later it is completely dead. It does charge up again ok. The reason I purchased this one is that the battery has a 1 yr warranty.
I do not use Win 8 as of yet. From what I have heard there is a compatibility issue trying to run it on Win 8. However you could download and install "VMWARE player" and if you have a copy of Winxp, you can install it after installing VMWARE. It is a pretty cool program. I have tested it out and was quite impressed by it. You may have to buy the program though once your trial period ends.
Good Question something I'd like to know as well. However you can buy all these on GOG.com DRM Free and you can burn them to a cd/dvd. They come with installer and everything. just go here to check it out--&gt; http://www.gog.com/catalogue/strategy
the one i bought was for windows only.
Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?
Compatability mode 256 colors check
It can be played on the 3DS, 3DS XL, and 2DS. It can not be played on any earlier systems, including any DS or DSi.
Yes it works on the 3DS, 3DS XL, and 2DS.
Yes they can! They would each need to have a separate 3DS though.
Well I know about the games so here what you need to know. On X you can catch Xerneas in x only. and on Y you can catch Yveltal only in y in Team Flare headquarters in the game. And on Y there are some pokemon and mega stones you can get only on Y . And on X there are some pokemon and stones you can only can get only on X unless you trade pokemon from y and x with someone with the games.Mega Mewtwo and Charizard Mega forms are different in x and y. In X mega charizard x is blue with an Chrariarizard X stone only in x .And in y Charizard Y is orange with a Charizardite Y stone. And mega mewtwo in y has a different form as mega mewtwo y with mewtwoite y only in y.and in x you get mega mewtwo X form with a Mewtwonite X stone only in x. If you want you buy pokemon x and y pokedex guide from Amazon and you will see the difference and it will show you everything you need to know if you have anymore questions about the games. This answer is right.I know a lot about pokemon games if you need to ask anymore questions about these game just ask. I hope this was useful. HAVE A NICE DAY!
It could be due to the differing mega evolutions and Pokemon. Xerneas is a beast.
Yes it has.
I believe it onky plays on the 3ds and 2ds, not the dsi
Every Pokemon game starts in a new region the mechanics and plot of the game are always re introduced at the beginning of every game as long as she can read she will be able to understand the Pokemon world so yes Pokemon X is good for beginners as its a new region and the 6th generation of pokemon
It really does depend on which legendary Pokemon you like better--I liked the Xerneas, so I went with X. One of my sisters has Y, and she likes it just as much as I like X. So, I may recommend X, because that's the one I got, but they're basically the same game :)
Absolutely. The game can be enjoyed either way. You don't have to be connected if you'd rather enjoy single player.
It can be played on the 3DS, 3DS XL, and 2DS. It can not be played on any earlier systems, including any DS or DSi.
Yes it works on the 3DS, 3DS XL, and 2DS.
Yes they can! They would each need to have a separate 3DS though.
Well I know about the games so here what you need to know. On X you can catch Xerneas in x only. and on Y you can catch Yveltal only in y in Team Flare headquarters in the game. And on Y there are some pokemon and mega stones you can get only on Y . And on X there are some pokemon and stones you can only can get only on X unless you trade pokemon from y and x with someone with the games.Mega Mewtwo and Charizard Mega forms are different in x and y.

Yes. Any 3DS game is playable on the 2DS. You simply don't get the 3D option during some of gameplay.
It has a choice of 7 languages. Spanish is one of them.
The difference between x and y are the pokemon available. There are a few pokemon that are specific to x or y (like larvitar in y and aron in x for example). Additionally, in x the legendary you get is Xerneas and you get yveltal in y. There are also two different mega evolutions of charizard depending on which game you have. Visit serebii.net and check out the x and y pokedex to see which pokemon are available in each game.
Each system requires its own copy of the game to play multiplayer, if you plan to get two copies, then one of you should get pokemon Y and the other one should get Pokemon X so you can complement each other with the things your version lacks.
My friend sent me the NTSC version I guess it was because buy from Venezuela! Greetings!
Pokemon Y is only 3DS this game does not work on DS OR DSi.
Totally yes. The game is very fast paced and easy to learn, you will have zero issues even if you haven't played any of the games released before.
Yes.
you should cancel your order, this only works with a 3DS. But if you buy a 3DS, your son can play either DS and 3DS games, hope this helps you.

Yes! All 3ds games work great in the 2ds. We have had no trouble.
Most 3DS games have the language set to what your system's language is set to.
Totally. Maybe he/she would be terrible at first. But the kid could learn. I, as a 'kid' myself, can say it. When I was five, I loved this games, so somehow I managed to learn how to play it. Mario Kart is a game for all ages! No matter how old you are, you will always have fun playing it! :)
Of course! The 3DS XL is just a different 3DS model, not an entirely different game system
Yes, if you wish to play with someone far away from where you are, you both need cartridges...you can play on wireless though, without cartidges. Although the person without the cartridge will be a Shy Guy. Have a nice day :)
No, Mario kart 7 only works on the 3ds, but it is a heck of a lot better then the wii version in quality and features, and it supports some of the courses from the Wii, SNES, and another console that I don't remember, but with some exclusive courses as well.
Yes, its fully supported only difference is screen/unit size in 3DS-XL.
Mine did not come w a case
It can be shared wirelessly with someone in the same room
Mario Kart 8 is available on the Wii U

Yup :) Up to four playable characters and houses, the first person created will be Mayor and the rest will just be villagers :)
No! The game is mostly plotless honestly. Its very relaxing and the goals that one can obtain within the game require no alternative knowledges from previous versions!
Sadly no, you can however get a similar game called Animal Crossing: Wild World.
Yes. It is possible for you both to play on one game card. However, the game saves to the cartridge, not the actual system itself. Therefore, you will have to share the same town. The only problem is that one of you will be the mayor, and the other will be a resident in the town. It doesnt affect much except your ability to create public works projects and create ordinances, really something the two of you can discuss in person and work out in the real world. Other than that, the game will be almost identical, except for some of the villagers not calling you the mayor.
I feel as though age varies with this game (and previous versions). I am 22 and love playing AC, and have since I was 12. All age groups can play given that it doesn't have a difficult story line or controls. I would even venture to say that children as young as 7 or 8 could play AC. Hope this helps a little.
I haven't been playing for long but I reckon its fine for all ages :) hope this helps
Yes it does
Yes. All DS games as well as all 3DS games will play on a 2DS.
I am able to interact with other AC players around the world. I do not know if they are using the same game device (3DS) and game as we have in the USA. Wish I could have been more help.

The Razer Mamba is a hybrid design wireless mouse where the charging station acts as the receiver for the mouse signal. The USB connection on the charging unit is also the same cable you move to your Mamba to put it in wired mode.
The Mamba works great while hard wired. I owned a Death Adder prior to the Mamba and performance is identical. The only difference is that the Mamba has two extra buttons and a little more weight.
Better battery life on the elite and RGB lighting. That also claim better wireless.
The charging station cable is mini usb on one end, and usb on the other. I don't see why you wouldn't be able to use an extender cable on the end of that. I would think it'd work just fine.
Yes!!! Just got it April 17th and it works great.
Yes it does, I actually use this mouse when I play CSGO and it's pretty much the perfect mouse for that game.
Yes, it's the latest product, got mine a few days ago.
It does, But I very strongly recommend against the purchase of this mouse or any Razer product for that matter. The software necessary to use this mouse properly is terrible, constant crashes and extremely slow. The mouse hardware is constrcued quite poorly. It feels cheaply made. After I have owned it for just over a year I have had consistent issues with the device. Razer's support hasn't been any help and frankly neglected my issues with the device.
it is rechargeable. i don't know for sure how long it lasts because i just plug it in each night. i use it at my office at work.
i got a big box because i got 2 of them, i don't know what happens if there is only one.
I really don't know - I have Windows 7. I will tell you that I was somewhat disappointed with Jigsaw World. The problem is that it doesn't save what you've done on a puzzle. If you get half the puzzle done & then have to leave, you have to start over when you go back to the game.
yes. on vista also which is what I have.
Yes I have Windows 7. It works well.

You would NOT need a 3D emitter because your TV has one built-in as does mine (KDL-55HX729).
To be honest im not completely sure i know there not compatible with most dlp projectors because these glasses use ir to work. dlp link devices use some type of flash to work. some projectors(not all) have a ir emitter. you can buy and a setting to disable dlp link, but it would be better to find a decently priced set of 3d glasses that have the dlp link function. it may cost a little more but at least you will know they definitely work correctly hope that helps
Each new pair comes with a cable. It is a standard USB micro Type B and can be purchased any where online, like Amazon.com or Monoprice.com. If you need it right now, most big box stores, like Walmart, Target, Best Buy and Radio Shack will have them also at a much higher price. Hope this helps.
It means those games with 3d compatable can be played in 3d mode, where u would need the 3d glasses to see it displayed in 3d, but it also has the regular mode which is called 2d. So u should have the option to select 3d or 2d/regular on those types of ps3 games.
These glasses will work with this projector. It has a built in IR transmitter.
When the infrared sensors do not receive a signal from the TV the glasses shut down, and the room is brighter. When they are receiving the signal the room is dimmer. Solution: sit a bit closer to the emitter on the TV.
I do not have the Epson 5020, but from what I have read, the Epson 5020 uses RF glasses whereas the PS3 glasses are IR (infra-red). So they would not be compatible. I read that the previous Epson model used IR, so maybe that is where the confusion comes in.
Yes
As far as I know, they should work perfectly. My 2010 Samsung TV also uses infrared and shutter glasses. I believe Samsung switched to bluetooth in 2011. I haven't played any 3D games with the system, but 3D movies work fine.
Yes
It's not just Amazon...Sony changed it.
My guess is it will be released in September along with Resistance 3. They didn't state an approximate date but it would make sense since: 1 copy of Resistance 3: $60 1 6' 1.4 standard HDMI cable: $28 1 pair of 3D glasses: $70 Making the TV roughly $342 If they wait too much longer after the release of Resistance 3 the value of the additional content outside of the TV starts to drop, making it become less of a deal. At the release of Resistance 3 they'd have the sweet spot for buyers and the potential to sell tons.
It's important to note that Sony is probably crippling SimulView capability through EDID, so that in addition needing games that support it (most currently do jot) and glasses that support it (most currently do not) it is probably also necessary to have an EDID spoofer which fools the PS3 into thinking the monitor attached is the Sony SimulView (tm).
Never listen to the contrast ratio provided by manufacturers unless they're talking about static contrast. Anyone can throw out a ridiculous number out there like 1000000000:1, there isn't a standardized way of measuring contrast.
You can hook up anything to it that can be done so via HDTV or component cables. However, in regards to your title asking if it has "normal tv functions", it does NOT have a built in tuner. This is why Tretton called it a monitor, rather than a TV.
This was going to be a sellin point for me, I would love to hook it up to my computer in the office and bring the PS3 in there as well, Hope they all play well together
Just FYI if you play multiplayer online the hmz does not have a mic so how r we gonna converse with other players...if they fix this I'd get it.
I contacted Amazon customer service and rep forwarded questions regarding the pre-order bonus to marketing. Will get an answer one way or another in 1-2 business days. Let's hope the Resistance 3 bonus comes back to Amazon!
I have one mounted, but it is NOT a standard VESA mount. It's not even square; it's rectangular. I had to cut my own adapter plate from another piece of rack mount hardware. I consulted with a Sony Store clerk before I did it. He suggested making your own adapter. But it can be done. I mounted mine on an arm. There's a subwoofer on the back, and if you mount it on the wall, you'll be covering and muffling it, but it can be done.
Here are a few specs if you need them: http://us.playstation.com/corporate/about/press-release/ps3-3d-display-in-fall-2011.html I really wish this tv was a little cheaper but I can't complain with what it offers. I don't enjoy playing split screen too much because of having to share the tv, but I think that this will help a lot with that. Because I don't have a 3d tv, I also feel like it would be something new and fun to me. I never enjoyed shutter glasses but these look much more comfortable than what is on the market right now. Overall, I wish I could choose a game other than resistance cause I already preordered it, or even just get the tv by itself, but besides this it is a very cool piece of technology that I can hopefully get.
open your 360 and read the label on the drive to see which Manufacturer and model # you need before you order the drive
Yes, I have two different 360 Xbox's I changed over with the above unit. one had P/N X800474-010 the other unit X800474-008.
You should have disassembled you SLIM and determined the exact drive before you ordered. Other than that don't have a clue.
There are a couple different models so you want to make sure you order the right one
It depends, when I purchased this drive it was for the sole reason that my reader and tray were shot. Instead of swapping the drivers completely I simply swapped the reader and tray from the new one to the old. This was so i didn't have to bother with firmware updates in order to make the dvd player read the games. Hope this helps!
Phat 360
Yes
if u bought games on line than the mother boeard in th disk drive has to be paired to the one in the x box or you'll never be able to log in to e box live well x-box live wont let u log in unless the mother board in the disk drive is paired to the 1 in your x box. reprograming is extensive work, or just swap out the electronics & soilder the connections...problemed solved or u could be banned from x box live 4 life on the unit dont freak if its simple... otherwise you'll just be playing dvds
Oh heck no there is some weenie circuit board on the original drive that needs to match the your xbox. Read up on this for sure. I just sold the old xbox 360 and got the new xbox 360e which is real nice.
The two models do not matter, any 16D2S-09C can also be swapped with a 16D2S and vice versa, it is the same drive. As far as online safe no one can really know for sure but Microsoft themselves but you should be fine.
Sorry Don't know I bought it for my Son
X box is a Microsoft program base the controllers are soposed to work on Microsoft games...However I could not find a driver that would allow the controller to work full time on everything.....but hey I don't know everything
Not that I'm aware of, but you probably want to check further online. I did not use a headset with this controller. Better yet see what options are available that were bought with this product.
Controller came to my house broken!
Hi,it's work well only in Batman play.....
Have you tried connecting it with the USB cord? I returned mine because once I took it off the cord, it shut off, and wouldn't go back on.
if u know someone that has one they can copy it for you other than that not really sure,the batarang was limited at the time it came out, I had trouble finding parts for it, so I purchased another one. the first one sits on a shelf , n I use the 2nd one to play games.
I ordered this controller twice and neither worked without being plugged in. They're mostly defective and I suggest you submit a return.
The one I had the cord was damaged. I had to play with the cord
No
No
not sure what you mean but it doesn't have SIXAXIS and the rumble function works nicely also I have made quite a few videos on YouTube with it its the controller I use the most on the ps3 I hope that answered your question
I just plugged it into my Ps4 and nothing happen so I would have to say it doesn't work with the Ps4 as for your second question I don't think any third party company's have made a controller for the Ps4 yet sorry
Connect it to both usb ports and then push the ps button in the middle. If that doesn't work then push the other two buttons. If that doesn't work then you have a faulty controller and you should send it back
I haven't tried it yet, but every ps3 controller works on a pc, so this one should easily work as well.
Not sure, but it broke after a week
you cant do anything about it which sucks i have a problem with the controller not working on my ps3 this controller over all is junk
Its a USB. A good one too.
Absolutely. In fact, while it's online, I would say it's pretty much a solo game. There are times when you're working with others, but it's not a communication/coordination thing. It's a great way to just sit back and play solo for an hour or two, and the addiction is good for a month or maybe two
Yes it does. It is a online only game.
Pretty often like once an hour or so. And they vary. Sometimes its an elimination or its a search and rescue. You never know.
You need gold.It's only made for online
You are more often fighting alongside other players in a competitive nature. But you only encounter PvP if you specifically choose to join a PvP event
NO A gold membership is the same as being an Xbox live member. If you play the PC version it is free period and you can just download Defiance but if you want this versions for Xbox 360 you will need a current membership. But to answer your main question Xbox live is Xbox Gold they are one and the same you pay $9.99 per month and that is it not twice and not for any separate service.
If I'm remembering right, it's because the game is being updated from a server not related to Microsoft, and that server has (at least had) very limited bandwidth; also be prepared for the actual gameplay to be as slow and stuttering as the download.
Yes you can create a local match to play with friends and family but I do not see a matchmaking option for a guest for the online portion.
This game is easy to play. It takes 'Forever' to download though. But, once it's downloaded - Let The Games Begin!!! It seems like everybody's playing it! Including me!
Probably never. They have shutdown their servers.
I haven't tried, but I believe so... it uses USB for power, and then red & white RCAs for signal... if your soundcard has RCA outs, or a converter, you should be fine...
no. it the standard 3.5mm, also, it may not work with cordless phone handset as you also requires usb as well.
Hello, The Trigger headset comes equipped with an HDMI adapter that will allow for the RCA connection to be bypassed.
If you have the adapter that you can get for Xbox One. It should work. But only if you have the adapter.
Yeah with any version because the controller is the same and the USB port as well
Yes. You can remove the Mic if you're just listening to music and the cable coming from the headset is a 3.5 mm standard for most regular audio services. So again short answer yes for sure.
Yes
Yes
Well, the head set comes with extra batteries and it also has a charge point the recharges ur batteries as soon as the light goes from red to green. Just switch the batteries and keep game'n they last hours and hours. Sometimes I don't switch the batteries for a few days . Hope that helped? Let me know Pablo
No.
No it says it specifically on the xbox adapter page on xbox.com that it does not work with the xbox one.
Dude, unplug is from the adapter, plug into your computer's headphone jack, and rock out. I use it for Twitch live streaming every day in the chat. Whenever there's a teamp speak, I'm already set up because I have the mic in the headset. Win, win. Just, don't jam too hard, they have a habit of blowing out on one side (left/right) and you're stuck listening in just your right ear. I've only had to buy a new one in the past 2 /12 years so, don't sweat it too hard. Hope that helps brother!!
They never seemed to "drop the sound" for me or lose any connectivity, but I've also used a pair of TB's x32's and didn't seem to have that problem either.
Hello! These are wireless.
No memory foam. They work well for my kids but I found that I can ware them for more than 45 minutes or so before they start hurting, where as I can wear my Bose headphones all day. I hope that helps. All and all they are very nice and great sound but it you have more of a round head they don't fit well.
We haven't had any issue. They hear us loud and clear for a foot or so away.
I'm not sure ..I would guess to say no. Seems these are for the X box 360
***Referring to Tritton "Triggers" not Tritton "Warheads"*** Not 100% sure it will work on PC, but it works with smartphones the same way typical hands free ear buds do. So I'm pretty sure they do. They are not wireless. And the biggest drawback to tho headset is that the cable that connects from the headset itself to the volume controller is only about 2 1/2 feet long, but the cables from the volume controller to the ends where they plug up are about 10 feet long. They hook up via RCA connection and a USB power supply. I do believe there is a wireless version to these that costs a little more.
Yes
Yes
Yes it is.
It has a total of six buttons, each mapped to buttons on the PS3 controller. Has alternative setting that work off of switches. Great stick, for sure.
I mostly use it on PC, but sometimes PS3 and I've never run into a game it doesn't "work" on. That being said, the L1 and L2 buttons are not very conveniently placed. If those buttons are used much for Disney Infinity, you might consider an arcade stick with an 8-button layout instead.
as of now, no. might need to mod it further.
Hi Will, I know of two methods to tighten the joystick on the V3 without upgrading the joystick or replacing parts. Hopefully one of these two methods will solve your problem (you can even do both). They both start the same way so let's begin. 1. Remove the seven screws on the back of the arcade stick (not the four holding the rubber feet on) to open up the controller. 2. Unscrew and remove the square gate (white plastic piece directly beneath the joystick) - Here is where the two methods differ. I have tried both but the easier one (which worked well for me) I will write first. Method 1: Electrical Tape This is an easier sort of quick fix that's guaranteed to reduce the wiggle room in your joystick. 3. Move the four black pieces (exposed after taking the square gate off) away from the white cylinder piece in the middle. *Remember the orientation of these four pieces for when you put it back together* 4. Wrap around the white cylinder with electrical tape. I believe any tape would do, electrical tape is just a precaution. 5. Test the tightness of the stick by screwing the four black pieces back down and playing with the stick. Add more tape as needed. 6. Reverse every step all the way back to one to put the stick back together. Method 2: Tightening the Spring This one would be just as easy as putting tape on if it wasn't for removing the c shaped clamp. You'll see once you try (or maybe I just suck, lol). One of the videos at the bottom shows how to take the clamp off. 3. On top of the white cylindrical piece there is a screw and a metal c shaped clamp. Remove the c shaped clamp. 4. This cylinder should come apart, dislodging the joystick and exposing a spring. Stretch the spring (the longer the spring, the tighter the joystick). 5. If you are comfortable taking off and putting on the metal c clamp, feel free to test out the joystick and adjust the spring to your liking. (This was very difficult for me on my V3 which is why I went with method #1 even though this method seems more professional.) 6. Put the stick back together by reversing every step back to step one. Here are some videos to help if I was confusing or left out details. Removing the square gate on a V3: youtube.com/watch?v=zNOE95P4lYY start at 0:00 and stop at 1:30, the rest isn't important for what you're doing Using Method 2 to tighten the spring: youtube.com/watch?v=4K2ONYAapOQ start at 2:26 and stop at 4:30, again the rest isn't important Contact me if you have any questions.
It would. Mine ran on a Mac and Windows 7. It works well on everything.
This stick is wired. Quite honestly... I never mess with wireless sticks :P
In the top next to the PS and start button I believe.
We'll the vx fight stick uses hori parts(stick&buttons) and the q1 uses qanba made parts.if you have extra money get a qanba q4 it's works with ps3/360/PC and uses sanwa parts for only $150.go to eightarc.com for more details.good luck
Difficult. The reason being is because in order to get artwork on properly, you would want to remove the buttons. In order to do so though, you would need to desolder the buttons because this stick does not have quick disconnects. Best option would be to look into possibly getting a laminated label that it sticky at the bottom but those usually aren't great
I'm not really sure Becuase I have not tryed it, but I too I have windows 8 And I use my regular x box remote controller and it worked, so I'm assuming It should. It is USB afterall. Well hope this was helpful. Kind regards.
It is not wireless but the stick has a nice feel and clicks in a most satisfying way. I use it for fighting games but see no reason why it would not work well for mz pacman or any other classic game.
Well, I heard that the buttons are soldered onto the stick and that it would be moderately difficult to mod when you have the correct tools, such as a soldering iron.
It's not for pc.
Hi David, yes, it works well on a Mac in X-Plane. And if you intend to purchase the saitek pro flight switch panel that too will work, but you will have to download a plugin Sandy Barbour's xpluginsdk.org
I don't know about a "detent"; they self center, and that big dial in the center is the spring tension adjustment.
No. This is made up of very sturdy plastic. The construction is solid and I believe it will last a very long time. The metallic part that you see is thin cover over the top center part of the rudder used as a cosmetic enhancement.
...not that I know, I got the cheapest from a trusted seller and no problem so far. I've bought only one therefore I can't really compare. Mine work just fine.
I fly a Cessna 172 and the Pro Cessna Pedals replicate the actual pedals in the plane. As far as functionality I doubt if there is any difference but I can't say for sure. The Pro Flight Pedals look to have more adjustments.
They will work with XPlane 10 (PC/Mac) the only real difference is the pedals in this model are fashioned and licensed by Cessna. If you're never going to fly a real Cessna (150/172/182) then there's no reason to go for these if the others are cheaper, the licensing is what brings up the price. They are essentially the same thing. I bought them to have the same 'feel' as when I went flying. but other than that there's no real reason not to go with the other Saitek brand pedals (if it's the ones I am thinking of).
No everything on the unit itself and the paperwork that I have is printed in English.
Yes; I got for it for use with X-Plane 10 on a MacBook Pro Retina running Mavericks.
Hi Tom, You can actually put your trim wheel below the TPM quadrant (it is actually more similar to how it is located in real C-172). Anyway, 27 1/2" should be enough to accommodate everything. However, make sure that the table is heavy enough. You do not want your display to drop on you when you are doing stalls ;-)
I use it for switching view modes in FSX (virtual cockpit / 2-d panel / outside)
NO PROBLEM! Though on a side note, I have had better luck using the windows update drivers for these things than the provided software. fwiw
Not sure about MBP, however I do have Win 7 with FSX installed on my Early 2013 iMac via bootcamp. Everything works great.
yes. Works very well.
I don't know, Tom K. My controls are mounted on the computer table.
The Yoke has multiple thumb rocker switches. One of those could certainly be mapped to "trim up" and "trim down", but it's push button trim and not a continuous function like a wheel. There's nothing that would logically or even remotely map to a rudder function.
I doesnt use a power cable. Just a USB included
The answer is nope it does not change the feel on the yoke based on airspeed. I found it great and it help me a lot in my training but is not the same as real flying, but pretty close.
I have played it on Win 7, and on Win 8.1, so I'm sure it will work for you. Have fun.
It should. I think it's not said to be able to work on Windows 7, but it does.
As far as I know there is no way to change the tiles to your own pictures at all
yes
I have Windows 7 Pro. So should be O.K.
I will pull the game and check it in the morning. Thank you Million Sold
Don't know.
True
I believe it's a file format for audio or spoken words. The game software has verbal comments during game progress.
Yes there is.
Try right clicking on the shortcut or executable, go to compatibility mode and run it as Windows 7 or one of the earlier versions of Windows.
Sorry, I can't help you on this. I have it loaded on a desktop and it works fine.
poker, blackjack, roulette and slot machines
Blackjack, Bridge, Canasta, Crazy Eights, Cribbage, Euchre, Gin, Go Fish, Hearts, Memory Match, Old Maid, Pinochle, Pitch, Poker, Rummy 500, Skat, Solitaire, Spades, Spite & Malice, Tuxedo, War. Hope this helps.
Yes
It does have Bridge
no
I have mine loaded on my computer and play it that way. I do not know whether you can play it any other way.
No, it doesn't. I'm sorry.
I don't know what pitch is.I was so disgusted with the Encore /Hoyle that I threw it in the trash after a few hours. I purchased Warfield's Pretty Good solitaire. Love it. Amazon has it. Hundreds of solitaire games! Just the card games. No characters to create. Just play cards! You have many choices as to how to move your cards. You can Drag them or right click to play the cards and It will make the move for you . If you right click and it were to ever place a card in a place other than where you meant - just undo. Undo and redo any move as many times as you want. There is a game called pitchfork in pretty good solitaire. never played it. Oh, and you can create your own solitaire games with the product. I am not that advanced.
Yes it does
Yes. Our system is 8.1 and it loaded and runs without any problem.
I wouldn't see why not. I threw mine away I did not like it...
Backgammon, Battling Ships, Checkers, Chinese Checkers, Chess, Dominoes, Tile Games, Master Match, Pachisi, Panic, Placer Racer, Reversi, Rummy Squares, Time Breaker, Word Games, Yacht, Zilch. Some of these have multiple variations.
It is compatable
You can download it to your computer.
I no longer have this puzzle and no you don't need a "joystick".
Yes. I use Windows 8 and have no problems at all. Enjoy.
Yes
My 2012 Hoyle I play on a 64 bit Windows 7, so I can say with certainty that this particular game will play on a 64 bit.
I'm playing it on 8.1
According to system requirements it works on Mac os x 10.4.10-10.6 G3, G4, G5. I hope this information is helpful. KC
Yes.
For this particular package you can download the disc/games to your computer.. HOWEVER, I also purchased the next package: WMS Slots Zeus II and on that one the disc has to be in the drive at all times to work.....I tried reinstalling it several times to no avil - it was just produced differently... But again, on Reel 'em in, once you've installed from the disc, you're good to go.. Hope this helped & have fun :)
Sorry, I can't answer that. I have Windows Vista and it works fine on my PC. Good luck!
It plays well. I have not had any problems.
Hi Danny I have not seen any as of yet jeannie
You need to install it but no I do not use the cd. I play it without being on the internet. It puts a i con up and you go to it and it comes up for you to play.
ipads run on iOS operating system (like iphones). The system requirement printed on the box is Windows (XP, Vista, 7, or higher
yes, but you must be connected to internet. It will not load on a computer not connected. A little hard to install but if you follow the instructions carefully it will install.
Not on this game.
This game is make for both computers
There is no complete list on this DVD. Instead you have make enough money in one slot in order to purchase another slot so that's how you will see the other games
from turtlebeach web site XBOX 360 Compatible* Works as amplified stereo headset on the XBOX 360. *Additional cables required (sold separately note it says AMPLIFIED STERO HEADSET not true surround
Yes for use on the laptop or xbox.. For the Turtle beach Charlie or Z6A head set #1 = Logitech 5.1 Game Console Adapter Convert Rca Plugs To A Single 1/8 #2 = Belkin Audio Y Cable Splitter 1-Mini Plug/2-RCA Plugs (6 Feet) This is what i am using for gaming out on my laptop.
nahh these are not wireless it all depends on what ur looking for if ur a hardcore gamer then sure i would buy them turtles beaches are top nothc headphones the only thing keeping them from being the is that they are made with cheap plastic even the expensive ones
why not just buy the z6A, same thing and cheaper.
Yes mine dosnt, I have to manuelly add everything.
all I did was install the drivers that came with it .I have installed on 2 different pc's both with windows 7 I have only had problems with getting them to work with music ..I have 2 sets of them on same pc and like i said had zero install issues
Well.... Chances are it could Just be broken? One of mine broke, at first I thought it was just a software problem but eventfully determined it was faulty hardware, I returned them and got my my money back! Shortly after I discovered the adalight mod, in in love with it, recommend 100% worth the hard work
It does work out of the box. Please vierw this link to the set-up diagram to see how: http://www.turtlebeach.com/assets/products/54/XL1_howWorks.jpg
I honestly don't know but I would imagine so
Im not sure dude I have an Xbox 360. but if it has the single connection on the controller id imagine so please don't take my word for it thats just a guess I hope I helped u out
yes i do
I have no clue. Havent tried it. my son used it for xbox.
I don't know but when mine showed up they had bare wire showing so I don't recommend buying this
Yes
Most turtle beaches work with pc and consoles
Yes ,but u need a dss converter. I use it on my xbox 360,xbox one and ps3
No. Don't need anything else.
Yes, you can use it on your PC and Skype.
Diane, no they are not. I specifically bought them for that reason because I have heard from owners of wireless headphones that the battery does not last that long and in order to keep using them after the battery dies, you have to buy another battery (which aren't cheap). Hope this helped.
If you want to simultaneously hear game sounds and people talking to you at the same time for consoles, then yes. On PC, no.
For me personally they fit around my ears. The inside cavities (the inside part with the logo on them, not the cushions themselves) are approximately 3 inches high and 2 inches wide, if that helps.
Works perfectly with xbox. You get all the cables you need
Depends on your tv. if you have an old regular tv, no. However, if you an flat screen, most likely not. If it has an audio in or out (red and white slots) then no. However, you need it if you use an HDMI for xbox because the standard A/V cable that comes with xbox 360 blocks the HDMI slot which you are trying to use. Look it up on You-Tube, which you can still use a alternative cheap way of fixing that. However, I myself bought the adapter because I felt like to, I didn't need it, but did. You can buy the cheap one or the Turtle Beaches adapter, both do the same job.
You can use the x12 on a pc...it does not have voice changing capability.
It plugs into both the Controller and the Xbox these Headphones have a lot of wires but for the price and sound quality they are hard to beat,As long as you don't mind a lot of wires.
I have 2 teenage sons who say they are very comfortable, unfortunately the mic went out on them after about 10 months so they no longer use them.
No but I have had a lot of problems with them.
Yes, you can use it on your PC and Skype.

I believe it will work for up to four, although I've only had two connected personally.
it does but I suggest you download the official microsoft xbox accessories drivers you will need to manually select the driver either way but the official download is more reliable than the ones on the disc
no
This should work with anything that connects to a regular XBOX 360. You might have to do some extra setup to configure the racing wheel 100% correctly, but as far as I know racing wheels are just slightly differently setup XInput controllers. Best of luck :)
If you're looking for an adapter for your PC that will connect an Xbox One controller to your PC, you may be able to already connect it using a USB adapter made for the controller. I don't know much about the Xbox One controller and its properties but do some research before you start spending your money.
has to be used with pc.
Sure is!
Yes but you have to follow the other ppls directions. I have Windows 8 and I had to go to properties and assign the xbox property to it for it work correctly
To be perfectly honest, I don't think this KIRFy thing will ever play nice with OSX. After trying three or four different mapping programs to get me some TF2 on my new Mac, I ended up just throwing boot camp with windows 7 on it and playing everything from there. It's not my ideal solution, but I just didn't feel like it was worth any more of my time to try and to get it working properly with all of that Cupertino wizardry.
Yes, it works great!
Yes. It works. I haven't tried to see how much of it works but I've used it on my Intel NUC before
Press the play/pause-symbols button to stop (pause) the recording playback; press the back button to return to the Recorded TV screen, and back again to return to the main media center screen.
It's Microsoft, has all the certified seals.
IR
It controls our whole tv once we programmed it to the tv. Which wasn't too difficult. I don't even use my tv remote any more, I just use this one.
Yes. If I'm not paying a game on the Xbox, I'm using this remote to navigate just for convenience. If you can get around with the cursor you can do it with the remote.
No. It only controls the Xbox or the TV. No audio controls unless it is on the TV.
From what I see on the box that would be a no. Thank you and have a great day.
Technically no, because XBOX One doesn't have Windows Media Center Extender. However, I would assume the power, A/B/X/Y, etc. buttons would work.
A mouse is fine
There is no printed list on the inside. Only on the back of the box do you see some pictures with no names in 4 of the categories. In hidden games you see 2 names. Many of the games are for children. One thing I did not like in several games I could not get to exit and had to shut down the computer.
Hi Flo, No, unfortunately this would not work for you. You must have at least a net book that can attach to a dvd drive. As it does take up memory, I would advise using only with a laptop or desktop. If you have a tablet Amazon and Google Play both have lots of great free games I have found. It makes a great substitute when traveling light. ;) Good Luck!
Yes, but for some games you have to use the compatibility feature. Super easy takes about 3 minutes or less.
Yes. My computer is very old and no internet and it works well
I don't know because I couldn't get the game to load on my computer.
I dont know but you can figure most of the games without needing instructions.
The games work just fine on my computer which has Windows 7.
Yes. It plays on my Windows 8.1 64 bit machine.
all these games play off line, no need to be on the 'net. i can only assume the games will work with Vista Home Premium. the bit edition makes no difference, as long as other games play on your computer. hope this answers your questions. i believe this will be a good group of games for you.
No, you have to install the game on your computer it requires a certain amount of space on your hard drive ..see product for details on that. That's how computer games work. If you want a pop it in and play version , look for it on Xbox
As far as I know after looking at the packaging and the discs themselves they are just the standard retail releases. Also If you buy this make sure to try and install the second game when the collection arrives because my Assassins Creed 2 disc wouldn't even install or autorun and its been an issue many others have had.
I don't have an Xbox so I don't know about using the controllers, but you can play fine with just the keyboard and mouse!
mine was 1 for both
No
If you go here http://www.game-debate.com/games/index.php?g_id=18&game=Assassins%20Creed you can find the information you need. There is also a calculator that allows you to enter your PC info into and the result is your custom answer.
Yes
Yes it works on my windows on my windows 8 laptop
I have no idea. I bought the physical copy and it is not linked to Steam, but another program called "Uplay". It wanted the key codes entered there. And in my review I mentioned that I only received one key code instead of two.
Yeah, it worked for me!
Then you should probably buy a new adapter.
That I'm not sure of. I just ordered the correct power supply from Microsoft. Amazon does have one though. I believe it called the, E-model power suppy. Hope it works for you.
It comes with everything that is in the picture
Heavens no. 3-5 days. Or, 1-2 days. Depending the shipping rate you choose.
yes it do
The box says "for use with X-SLIM" Not sure if your X-Box is considered slim or not. Mine is also black. Don
No
I dont believe so but u can get an adapter for pretty cheap.
I have the 4 GB I bought this and it didn't work out of the package so i had to send it back there is another one sold by the same person its 4star rated but its like 10 bucks more way better choice for the 4 gb
I received brick and the cord, so I think you're missing a part.
Yes, the ps3 does not have a region lock like the ps2
It has a kind of bracketed 'story' mode which lets you choose which mission you want to do next based on difficulty and what suits you will face and unlock bonus missions based on which end boss you fight or the scores on the missions, and a 2 player mode of the same thing but with well, 2 of you instead of a computer ally, and I think there is a vs mode for you and your friends, I havnt tried that one yet, but the menu is easy to navigate even if you dont read japanese and the gameplay is kind lf addicting but somewhat repetitive, but I reccomend buying it if your a fan of gundam you will love it.
It has an English menu like Atase mode online mode off line mode but it is in the right handed corner of the game to select the mode press the circle button. The game has a few English sentences and words but the controls you have to look them up I highly recommend that. Don't just wing it, I did that and I lost so many battles.
Yes, I've used it with the XP400 and it does work. It seems to be a simple bluetooth connector and not model-specific.
It's a Bluetooth transmitter. YES, it will work!
It works with my Deltas and my Tangos with no problems.
As long as the xp500 can sync to a bluetooth source yes,
No. This is meant for the Xbox 360's controller, so you can't plug it into the Playstation DS4.
It's powered by the 360 controller.
This device only connects the Headphone to the Xbox controller through bluetooth. Most of TB's headsets have a mute button. Hope it helps.
No. But I thought the X1 had Bluetooth support?
That wont even fit properly into the controller. I have both systems, and sure wish it worked that way! The connections on the bottom of the remote are very different.
Chat only. No game sound.
5700 if I remember correctly.
my husband has no issues using it with ubuntu 12.4 and 13.10 he said
About 5 inches by 3.5 inches it fits very comfortable in the hand because of its unique wave design.
I have not used the raw version but honestly it doesn't look like there is a difference at all other than the aesthetician Diablo 3 logo. The light also slowly pulses. And this Diablo 3 version has the rubberised surface not metal. As for the the latter it uses an optical not laser.
Button list : Left click, Right click, Left side buttons, Right side buttons, Middle click, and Middle button (Middle button makes sensitivity ultra fast) (Both sets of side buttons can be remapped using steel series's software)
Call Amazon if you have had the mouse less than 30 days. If not call steelseries.
It's lightly coated and doesn't feel slippery at all. It grips fairly well. Only thing I've noticed is that after a few weeks of moderate use, the moisture from my hand has started to fade the design colors a little. Mouse is a beast though.
i'm not in USA and ss' mouse dont have warranty in foreign country.
I notice that on a different mouse that has a damaged cord, but not with the Diablo mouse. The issue I am having with this mouse is my computer doesn't always register that the mouse is plugged in.
approx 6 feet. and very heavy duty braided cable. edit: according to the ad info Cable: 2m (6.5ft), braided
Yes you will have tracking, but you are responsible for custom fees. Thanks
Might need more information to go on like OS, make and model of your computer, driver version for the steelseries world of warcraft legendary mouse, firmware version (if applicable), and what exactly you can't get the mouse to do. As far as official "support", no Steelseries has not released a driver that is related to the Mists of Pandaria expansion. That being said, all the same functionality I experienced with the Legendary Edition mouse in Cataclysm I am experiencing in Pandaria. So please elaborate?
Yes
Yes, I have windows 8 and works perfect.
DPI is for your screen. I don't think a mouse has anything to do with DPI (dots per inch).
The mouse cord is like any other mouse - good length. The item is not heavy at all.
Of the BOX? Is 2 1/4 high, 5 3/4 wide, 7 7/8 long. Now as far as SHIPPING dimensions goes, whatever box the seller is going to put it in will depend on them. Cause the shipper I got this from (Amazon) put it in a BIG box with lots of packing material.
YES.
I use it for both gaming and regular use.
Yes can we ship Brazil, but you maybe responsible for custom fees. Thanks
NO it is not compatible. PS4 dropped the ball on Bluetooth. Where with ps3 you could basically use any bluetooth Mic/headset. I learned this the hard way after purchasing this. Only good with PS3
Yes it is but it not great quality. Put a few more $$$ and get a better one.
Not sure if it is compatible with cellphones, but the overall quality is not that good... but you get what you pay for
4-5 hrs of game play
Around three hours
Just the chat.
same here low volume, but it works, have you turn your volume up in settings on your playstation? just a thought
Not sure, sorry.
Yes it can connect. Can the people hear you when you speak? Not unless you're yelling into it.
my son uses his on a DS lite
Yes.
I didn't work on my son's 3DS, so we returned it.
I have not used the codes for the game yet but it shows codes for it. I believe you can enter codes as well. I am using it for Dragon Quest IX right now.
Yes, absolutely. You can enter codes manually directly on the DS/DSi system.
No. For that you will need to purchase the powersaves 3DS
yes!
Yes it does very well worked for game I needed.
It works on all ds games. If you want something for 3ds games, get power save. But if it's regular ds games, get this.
Yes, but you will have to download the update from the website so it will work.
my son uses his on a DS lite

Yes, I had Windows 8 and it worked great. Upgraded to 8.1 and still works great.
Yes one grandson was in our office on the main computer, and the other grandson was in the living room on his laptop and they were playing together. They did use Steam to do this.
you have to have "steam" to install the game. You are not suppose to need it after you do. I could not get it to work with internet or with out it. If you purchase it. It takes a great deal of time to install it. Sitting with your computer running. Find a book to read.
no the dlc for game of the year includes new factions such as the Inca and Polynesians and a few more and the explorers map pack
You have to use Steam to play this game.
It does come with a code for the game. And it installs a program where you can play against other people. So I would say yes, the code allows you to play other people online, if that is what you are asking.
Don't know for sure. Mine works like a charm. Make sure you have also loaded the associated program "Steam". If you haven't that May have something to do with it.
If you are running windows, go to the control panel and open. open system. it will tell you what version windows you are running.
I am Not sure if I understand the question but I'll try to answer. I use the hard copy to load the game and it also loaded esteem function that allows me to save to the cloud. Once the game was loaded I didn't use the disc anymore.
TnsDeals - It's PC Game
The black version is not glossy. It does seem to have a sort of glossy feeling on the sides but even that is not much. So to sum up, it is mostly not glossy.
I am not exactly sure what "low pressure" means. This one is fairly stiff with a clicky feel, it is rather easy to press. Although much harder than a cheap clicky $5 mouse. I have never laid to much attention as to how clicky those buttons are so I am not very experienced in the field.
Yes, you can. But if you want performance, i suggest you buy the steelseries qck pad
The hardware itself should work perfectly find. The software I'm not sure but to be honest I never use it
Version 2
It has one single button which cycles through the three dpi settings. So no it does not have up and down buttons.
Up only
V1
Not that I can recall.
About 12cm or 4,12 inches
Yes it worked
It's about 6ft.
Kana v1
Truthfully this software is so user unfriendly for me that I never did get the hang of it. I bought it to improve my chess game. Spent so much time trying to learn the software there was no time for chess. If you are not a geek you might want to try something else.
Yes. Game files and be saved/exported in *.pgn format as well as fritz/chessbase (*.cbh) formats.
Yes, it works just fine on Windows 8.
It is a similar difference between buying the home version of software and buying the full-blown professional version possessing greater functionality.
I don't know, I have windows 7.
Yes - I'm running it with 64 bit Windows 7 Professional
The program I bought does not include the Deep Fritz multiprocessor engine. I wish I knew where the best place to buy Deep Fritz would be (price-wise, I mean). You could try a site specifically dedicated to this brand of chess programs. If such a site doesn't exist, you could try any number of stores such as Chess House, TheChessStore, etc. I hope this has been helpful to you. Take care. --Mark
only windows, using windows running software on the mac might work.
Snippets. The company that produces Fritz has full instructional videos for download or DVD, but you need to pay for them.
Yes. Full database.
Is it a different language lay out? ?
Unfortunately I couldn't but I never found my self using that feature anyways, its very easy to just remove the touch pad from inside the keyboard, I love this keyboard but that touchpad was a pain in the butt.
Yes and Yes
Works well. Although mine is a blue key color rather than red. I like the keys to light up for the time I type at night. Hope that helps..
About 6 ft.
I have used this on on PC but only with the Simraceway online racing game. It seems to work really well. It is more or less "plug and play" but I needed to enter the "Settings" menu to set up the control functions. For Simraceway, it is very flexible. You can set the wheel, shifting and pedal control to pretty much any button (or pedal) you want. It does indeed work on PC (running Windows 7).
No. They just need to be plugged in and your game set to steering wheel controls. The instructions are also very good at exposing for to set buttons
Yes
No
No
No
Yes
No
Yes
Yes the cable works with both Rocksmith and Rocksmith 2014, as I have both on my laptops, I use both since some songs can only be played with Rocksmith, so you will not have any issues using the cable for just Rocksmith, enjoy playing..............
I tested it on Garageband, Ableton on windows 7 and it gave me Awesome results. Ubisoft made the best of two worlds. A little latency but nothing serious.
Yes
Yea it should work fine, thats what I use.
No, it's a standard 6.3mm 1/4" jack connector which works with all the guitar... It should be fine with yours too!
It works perfectly fine with garage band
Supply and demand, really... IWD
No, you can't. But you won't be needed it as the game provides you with every effects you need for the songs. Also, you can customize every aspect yourself in the game.
Yes. It works on Windows 8 and 8.1 operating systems - 32 and 64-bit (laptop or desktop).
Yes, I use it on rocksmith 2014 on ps4
you can but it is very low audio. i recommend anything other than this headset such as astro, etc.
On any 360 game
found them in at least 2 places: Amazon.com on page:
You use the sync button just like a controller
No.
That pretty much means you need to have the base game, I believe. The Sims 3 Pets is just an add-on, it isn't the game itself.
Pets adds in dogs, cats, and horses. Along with ranches, dog Parks, cat Parks. And jobs for the pets. Like working in law enforcement, spiritual hunter. Supernatural adds in vampires (if you don't have nightlife) werewolves, fairy's, witches, plant Sims, and zombies. Along with magic, and other super natural stuff. Also adds the ability to have a lunar phase. I have both and they are quite fun. In the end the decision is yours. But I believe these items are cheaper on origin so you might beable to get both. I can't say that one is better than another. Look into both of them on several sites and see what they include. I know supernatural comes with some plants vs zombies stuff and 500 sim points. And pets comes with something and like 500 Sims points. Oh and they each come with a town.
No it doesn't have the base game the only ep that come with the base game is the starter pack one that also include late night and a stuff pack
Yes
Only if it states for Mac.
The Origin software that is downloaded when you install your Sims 3 (may be different if you store bought the Sims 3) will automatically download this when you enter in the code provided with your download. If the download did not complete properly or was interrupted you may have to re-download. If you cannot install after double checking your install, contact the seller.
I couldn't get mine to fully download at all. I'd recommend ordering the actual disk or going to a store that would sell the game disk
I have Windows 7 and it works, if that answers your question. It's phrased a little funny so I'm not too sure what you mean.
If I gave you mine would it still work?

Yes. The other USB plug is for the pass through USB port on the back of the keyboard.
It does work with Windows 8 very well with no problems.
The intensity has four different settings: off, dim, medium, and bright. However, the color cannot be adjusted.
Yes. It attaches with screws, but it is shipped detached.
Yes, download the latest drivers and there is an option for it.
The extra keys are in the rest. As well as the key pull it might be the seller you bought from it is supposed to come with the rest
There is a peripheral USB port located on the top.
no
Yes, you can.
It should be although I'm not sure if the media buttons will work. If you're planning to use the USB port on the keyboard (there is one on the back close to where the cord connects), you'll need 2 USB ports fairly close to eachother on your computer.
I have Win 8.1, and it seems to work fine. I do currently have a problem with incorrect keystrokes registering from the keyboard, as discussed in my review of this keyboard. I don't think this is an incompatibility with Win 8.1, otherwise I would imagine all the keystrokes would be acting up, and not just a few.
geego octopus keycaps
Only the main keys, arrows, and numpad. Esc, f keys, home group, and print screen ones are not.
It works with Windows 8 flawlessly. There is custom software/drivers that provide firmware updates that may not be compatible with windows 8 however.
I guess the first question is do you have both plugs for the kb in. If so try plugging them into known working usb ports
Yes, it works with Mac. A few of the extra keys do not work, but the standard keyboard works as any other would.
Eyeballing it, I'd say 6 feet.
it's not sadly. but it is still a great keyboard rest assured. Mechanicals can get a bit complicated if something goes wrong with it
I'm not entirely sure, I have windows 7, try and look to see if there a forum for its compatibility
Yes that is correct. Thanks.
no. it is wire..
It is NOT a mechanical keyboard. The price is the main giveaway on that. The keys feel fine though. I use it more for typing and that works well (I use the Logitech G13 for gaming). So far so good!
Yes- I'm using it with a Lenovo G-series laptop running Windows 8.
No, its not.
I wasn't aware of a high pitch whine with the G9X. Mine works flawlessly thus far.
Yes it is the same basic mouse, this one just has the "Call of Duty' graphic on the mouse grip and comes with a mouse pad.
yes, it certainly does. you can just plug it in and use the native windows driver or download and install the Logitech software for it.
It does have English subtitles.
Yes it has English subtitles but the spoken language is Japanese
It has English subtitles and Japanese audio
Yeah
Which marine?
Its ok it depents I rather enjoyed it but I'm also a hardcore aliens fan so I like almost any alienss game but the graphics are kinda crappy the gameplay is kinda like call of duty I would give it 5 out of ten
This game is TRASH do not waste your money!
Yes
one player,but has online multi players on live
Yes They Fell Pain Although They Are Robots But The Emotions and The Felling Are Truth and Similar To Our Senses We Humans, i Hope This Answer is Well Convincing You Thank You For You'r Question :).
It's only mentioned. Unlike the first game where the Matrix changes hands into Optimus' for the first time; this game focuses on the actual Fall of their home planet. Optimus stays the Prime and despite not hearing anything about a third game there could easily be one if they feel the need to make it. If your an old fan it will please you with how they molded the story, if a new fan you will love it the same. The biggest suggestion to make for anyone is to search the levels, find the 'Easter Eggs', collectables and just general background details that give a boatload of extra depth to both game stories.
My son who I bought the game for says yes it is part of the G1 Canon
I've not been able to. Unfortunately, I don't think you can.
The multiplayer is online only. No local split screen.
I would recommend for children. There is not any cussing and the violence is no more than they would see in "Transformers The Movie", which is carried out in a cartoonish manner with swords and gadgets. Now if they play online that is a different story but even online everyone tends to be respectful because majority of the players are children.
The other games aren't separate downloads. Just open Traitor Soul, make your character etc.., and then once you start playing you will start out in the Temple of Fate and have the option to go to the town of Grove (Game 1), the outpost of Druantia (Game 2), or the Outpost of Typhon. Unfortunately the Town of Grove isn't exactly like the original Fate (you'll notice the differences in monsters, your pet, merchandise, etc..) which irked me at first, but once you get used to them they're pretty neat.
I haven't found any problems w/ playing this game on Windows 8, I have been playing for approx. one month.
Fate is more of a diablo clone. point and click with the mouse to do everything.
Jonathon, if you know right about when it stopped working, I would run a System Restore back to just before that, maybe a couple of days if there's an entry for that time. It will uninstall programs installed since then, and will also uninstall Windows updates, and I'm pretty sure it takes care of Java updates, if you have that installed (most people do). It won't affect your documents or internet favorites or anything like that. If that doesn't make the game load correctly, I would uninstall and reinstall the game. You can locate your game save folder, and copy the whole thing to your desktop or Documents or whatever. For Windows XP, it's in C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\WildTangent\fatethetraitorsoul\Persistent\SAVE, or for Vista and 7: C:\Program Data\WildTangent\fatethetraitorsoul\Persistent\SAVE. These folders will be hidden, so you'll have to set the Explorer window to show hidden and system files. I would just copy the whole SAVE folder, uninstall and reinstall the game, and then start a new game just to make sure the folders get reestablished to start with. Then copy your old SAVE folder onto the new one. I did this moving the game from one computer to another, and it worked fine.
This particular one is for PC only. It has to specify for Xbox 360. Hope this helps!
No, thankfully this game was made by people who understand how to distribute games. It comes as a CD but it will install #3 and you will have to choose to play in the #1 or #2 story lines.
Yes. You can install it on as many computers as you want. :) These people actually know how to make a game that's nice to the user.
I play sole all the time. Once installed I don't even need an internet connection or the distribution disk loaded to run the game.
Yes.
Yes it does!
If your xbox 360 E is thick version, then this hard drive could be compatible with it.
Plugs straight
It fits on the latest xboxes that have the compartment door for HD hope this helps
It fit in my Xbox 360 slim. I don't know which others it's compatible with.
No it is not compatible with the 1st model xbox 360s not does the xbox 360 elite. Because the hard drive for that console attaches to the top and doesn't have an internal hard drive slot. But the 2nd and 3rd model 360s do because they have internal hard drive slots.
No. I brought it and it was too small
No
It is not. For xl
No
Most consoles now days dont use av cables. Mine came with HDMI cable and that was it. If you have wifi its easy to set up too.
Most games, yes, but the are a good amount that are either non functional, or not fully functional.
Yes
No
I had to buy the battery pack with a cord that plugs into the controller in order for the controller to work. You could also use regular batteries in order to get the controller to work, but I just went with the battery pack with a cord. I bought the battery pack from Gamestop, but I'm sure Wal-Mart or K-Mart have them also. Hope this answers your question.
Yes
Yes
I believe it's American
No cables, you can get them from the game store for 20 bucks
I am not the seller.
Dear Michael, You can but it will be like a copy with extra, the director's cut is for those who hadn't played the game or don't even have it, becasue it only contains the game along with the dlc already installed, soundtrack and the videos. So if you like, you can download the DLC, watch the videos and listen to the soundtrack and by that, it will be like you have the director's cut. I hope this helps you.
Heavy Rain: Director's Cut was released as a "complete" version of the game which includes the only piece of downloadable content, The Taxidermist, as well as the game soundtrack, Playstation Move support, eight making-of videos, three dynamic themes, fifteen pieces of concept art, and two bonus trailers. The game is also marked as a Playstation Greatest Hits title, bearing the red box.
Not sure but I only think it has 2 languages
I bought a fulfilled by Amazon version and it was totally brand new and sealed. It did not include the booklet unfortunately but the game was excellent!
10 languages offered. However, Subtitle only for chinese is available
Yes the game comes in Spanish language but don't know if it's Spain or Latin version, the game also have French
Never got that far found it boring since game plays it self and you occasionally do something try saints row mature game but excellent fun full package has lots of extras
You should know your way around the controller for sure but the base of the game is very user friendly and plays more like a movie than a video game. Actually allot of fun for a new gamer.
The Director's cut have full PS Move support, the Taxidermist DLC, sound track and videos of the making off. Greatest hits don't have any of those.
I can tell you it is a very exciting game, a fancy frame! I highly recommend it!
There is a similar Xbox One title, but the Xbox One does not support use or play Xbox 360 game disks. It also requires a Kinect.
I'm a beginner, and found this hard to follow. It's not good about giving you a heads up about what's coming. It also changes moves too quickly in my opinion. By the time I was starting to catch on, it was already six steps into the next dance step. You pretty much have to repeat the song until you had it memorized, or make up your own moves. Haha. Though Zumba fitness had problems, I enjoyed that one much more and went back to it after trying rush out a few days.
I works with any xbox kinect successfully attached to your console
It is so much better since it focus in the whole body and the sessions range are really nice
I don't know but I wouldn't waste my money. You're better off buying a Zumba video without the annoying defective fake "game" function that just distracts you from learning the steps.
Yes. Two player mode
The biggest difference that I noticed is that the songs seem faster paced in Zumba Rush.
No, but there are a lot of songs in Spanish on this game.

Yes and you can change the color of the light in the settings.
It does work on a Mac, but you cannot program it (i.e. change the colors etc). All the buttons work when booted into the Mac in their default states (thumb buttons are the number keys, right/left/center/scroll). You can change the main mouse buttons using the Mac Mouse Preferences. The colored light remains the last color it was set to on Windows. I use it on my Mac all the time.
Call razor you may be able to get a replacement
Honestly I don;t 100% remember since that was some time ago. If I am not mistaken, you had to sign up on the Razer site and then you would get a code.
Any update?
Yes. I have an Arcade console, it worked perfectly.
Ouch :( I was in a similar position when I moved all my multiplayer saves to my flashdrive to play at friend's, but the files became corrupted after a while. I had thankfully made a backup on my pc 3 months before with Xport 360. So you're saying evrything was moved from the original drive to the new one over the cable but the data wasn't there when you started the 360 with the new drive? Or did Xbox Live apply an update and the data was erased after the update? It might still be there and recoverable, just unrecognized by the 360. First do not pit more stuff on the drive! It increases the chance of any data there previously being overwritten or becoming fragmented! Best to not even turn the 360 on with the drive in. Try using fatx explorer, as it actually has a recovery tool for deleted files. If the 360 redormatted the drive entirely though, your data is gone, as formatting deletes the data and overwrites it with a blank slate.
If it has a detachable Hard Drive then yes.
Yes it should.
It is being used for System files on the Xbox. It is the same concept of getting a HDD for a computer where it says (some number) but available is less. The system files used to run your xbox along with any updates, DLC, or games will use this disk space.
If you follow the instructions detailed in some of the reviews to "restore partition 2" it will play compatible Xbox games. It's pretty easy to do, you just need to hook the hard drive up to a Windows computer using a transfer cable and follow the instructions.
This will work with the old 360s.It attaches at the top.
I was lucky enough to get one that has no issues. I just connected it to my xbox 360 and it works like one made by microsoft. Except it will not play original xbox games. Not a problem for me. It is not uncommon that defective units slip through quality control and my guess is that you might have one. I suggest return it for exchange because Amazon has excellent customer service. I hope this was helpful. It should already be formatted and ready to go. Good luck. Thanks for asking.
External.
I have had this for about 4 and never had an issue years i think and never had an issue with single game. I would say i have played a good 30 games on that hard drive with no issue.
You can most definitely use your old saves, the only difference between this game and the original release is that the DLC is included. The rest is the same. Hope this helps! :)
No you do not just put in the game and play at any time you can install the dlc. I know because this is my 2nd copy of the game. I got halfway through the story and this was on sale so i bought it and installed, it works fine and I enjoy me Dlcs
Most definitely! The install disc can be used on multiple consoles and as many times as you need it.
It's like far cry
Its best to install it on the hard drive
I've never played on the regular version, this is the only one I've played
New vegas by far!!
Some of that edition did technically have Spanish. But I think a manual work-around is: Games Library--&gt; (rt-clk) to fallout new vegas in list--&gt; Properties --&gt; Language Tab
FONV is similar to FO3 in concept. FONV is different in that it dumps you right into the action with more creatures and gangs. As with FO3 it has several DLCs too. The graphics are slightly improved. Of course the setting is pretty cool. Please do finish FO3, good fun.
Yes, the ultimate edition has the original game plus a 2nd disc with all the dlc for you to download. You would be able to use the content from the original game and not lose it.
Yes. We have Wii sports and it consists of bowling.
This will support the Virtual Console of the old Zelda, Kid Icarus and Mario Brothers. If you are talking about using old NES cartridges with the Wii, that will not work. Hope this helps!
Well Your Wii Was Old and I Have a Blue Wii I Bought This Year it Still Works Great and i am Not Sure if Your Wii Can Play Dual Layer Discs.
I received the the wii which was fine but did not receive the Skylander game. I was dissappointed about that but when I read the fine print it did state the game was not included. I should have paid closer attention.
Absolutely (I think my daughter has played most of her games on it). This is a Wii through and through, just like the original ones produced many years ago. It just happens to be blue. The mini one, the red one, I wouldn't trust with my stock.
NO,this version does not play dvds.
No, in order for Netflix to operate, you will need to be connected to the internet.
I don't know, but I don't see why not. I think all you need is the belt and the sensor.
If it's a wii game and wii accessories you should have no problem.
I have taken mine overseas, you just need a power cable for your specific country with the correct voltage. If you check the back of the machine, it supports 100-240. Do not plug in your 110 cable in a 240 volt country and vice versa!
No, it's not censored. At least, being half way through I have not seen a censored screen. All the probing is there. I think only EU, AU, and Africa are censored.
It doesn't come with a manual. You learn everything you need to know to play the game while playing. (there might be a digital manual on the disc) It does come with a code insert for extra outfits.
There aren't any spoken languages besides english, but it has subtitles.
This is a PS3 game, so far the PS4 is not backwards compatible for previous console games.
Red
Yes it us.
I have not checked, but normally they are included. According to my information: Features Menus and Interface in - English, Francais, Espanol, Deutsch, Portugues and Italiano Features Subtitles in - English, Francais, Espanol, Deutsch, Portugues and Italiano Features Voice overs in - English Like I'm French, I confirm the support of the French language in menus and subtitles
I can't find any option to change the language.
It is rated M (ie for adults) for its content. If you allow your kids to watch the TV show, you'll find the equivalent level of content (language, ethnic jokes, etc.). The violence level is on par with what you see in the show as well. It is definitely not meant for kids, but it is really up to what you're comfortable with.
No and yes..No because it's same game . yes because you know when something is new when used it can be buyers beware.
The wheel is very solid. When you feel it you know it will last for a really long time. I use mine all the time and have had no issues at all with anything breaking or even showing signs of wear. It is a well built piece.
It uses an accelerometer, but I've seen setups where people attached it to the column of other steering wheels. The accelerometer is alright, in my opinion. It's not a high end wheel since no feedback, but it's nicer to use than a gamepad, or worse, mouse and keyboard. As for games, I tried it out with F1 2013, F1 2014, TDU2, Race 07, GTR Evolution, and DiRT 3, and they all worked fine after setting the controls to what I wanted.
no it won't. I'm sorry
It works with accelerometers, so you don't need to attach it to anything at all, unless you want to.
not all games this control is more used for simulator race games as iraceing and simraceway.
No.
Yes it will I use it for that game regularly.
Not easily. You can fabricate a mod to the G27 (youtube for specific directions). There is a mounting screw in the back of the SRW-S1 if you want to build your own mount for it.
I actually have a Mac, but it works as a standard device (it's kind of crappy actually on it), I don't own F1 2013 on MAC (i do on Windows). But I would recommend you to launch BootCam and run this wheel on Windows natively, if you can.
Yes, I have used with iRacing, Assetto Corsa, Need for Speed Shift 2, and Game Stockcar 2013. It works well but without FFB (force feedback). By comparison, in iRacing, I tend to be about 1-2 seconds slower per lap than I am with my Fanatec ClubSport Wheel and Pedals. However, I am certain that I could close that gap to less than 1 second with more practice.
If you charge it, it will stay charged up to 1 year not that it will only work for a year.
It will charge the Vita 2000, however you will need the USB cable from the original Vita 1000 kit to charge the battery. You should be able to buy the original Vita USB cable separately here on Amazon.
What was previously stated, only can be charged using the vita charger. But it does hold a very large charge and can be used to charge any USB device.
Yes you can. I bought this myself.
It didn't come with a cable
The battery pack itself is 2 5/8" x 2 5/8" x 7/8", I just measured it now.
absolutely! Just check The needed voltage and the charger's maximum. But it will work with almost everything
the ac charger that comes with the original ps vita will charge the portable charger.
I have charged my galaxy tab 3, Note 2 , Ipad 4 and ps4 controller with this
No
Yes. It is a split screen (top bottom).
GT5 XL adds a few special downloadable cars/tracks etc. GT5 is the full game, but the XL version includes content that came out after the initial release of GT5. If you bought GT5 and wanted the extra cars, you'd have to pay to download them. GT6 has a different interface, but many reviews said that GT5 was the purer game. Read some reviews on GT6 and GT5 to see what you think.
Says BCUS and it does have the Spanish language option.
I do not play online but offline yes 2 people can race against each other but you have to be in arcade mode. one thing I do not like is in my game the regular version when you tune your car's power and race against your buddies your car automatically goes back to the stock power of when you got it. but do not worry just in arcade mode but in this version when you upgrade your cars and race against your friends I believe my brother said the powers the same. he gots this extended edition
No
Yes it can.
No
Yes
Yes I believe it can. Old game still a great one!!
Yes

No
Yes it can.
No
Yes
Yes I believe it can. Old game still a great one!!
Yes
Yes that's what I did. Whenever you install the disc, the game will add to your steam account.
Not sure about the price difference, I myself was confused. However, I bought the PC version and waited a few days for it to ship to me. The CD key from the physical PC version will unlock the game on Steam for digital download. You should then have permanent access to it on Steam forever. Basically, if you can wait a few days definitely order the PC version and save some bones.
I don't think there is any game-play difference. Some people like to own the box art but generally just buying it on Steam is faster.
No, it loads something called "Steam" but the game installs on your PC and runs without being online.
Nope.
Im guessing yes, because it will be on your computer and not from a pc disk, i dont think it will require Steam. Worth a shot?
Yes. controls are the mouse, the space bar, and keys s, d, f, e, and g.
No
I ran it on XP and Windows 7
I run it on Windows 8.1 pro with no issues!
Yes. Ogre is playable when you start the game.
Yes, it comes with it.
I bought it used...if bought used I think you need to pay to get the new code..so yes you do need a code.
Yes, it is
Besides character customization and fight lab i don't think there's something more offered in the game. Over 50 characters to play with in story and arcade mode i guess
Windows will only recognize 5 buttons. The others you'd have to program in the mouse software to duplicate keyboard keys, like F1 to F12. This is true for all the mmo mice with lots of buttons. In addition, you can program macros to each button. For example, you could program one of the mmo7 buttons to simultaneously click on the target and activate a keypress like F12 (then bind "grenade throw" to F12 in the game), and voila, you have a mouse-over-target single-click grenade throw. Again, you can do the same thing with most high-end gaming/mmo mice.
No it doesn't. I just put everything on a USB drive, drivers, profile editor and profiles. A little more of an inconvenience but for me having a mouse fully adjusted and customized to my hand makes up for it.
There isn't any measurements as far as I can tell, but it does make sense because this mouse is fully customization. It can be very small once everything is retracted, or can be longer when fully extended. It can fit pretty much the average person's hand. People that would have a hard time would be someone who's 6'0 + and have huge hands.
all mouse buttons are configurable to any keystroke.
The mouse macro options in the software should allow you to program the buttons to activate keyboard keys, repeat recorded mouse actions, and mouse buttons. To open software, you could record presses involving the windows key, but it cannot natively open software.
due to the way your hand wraps around the mouse, even at rest it never touches it. FYI, that screw is actually the modification tool for the mouse. All of the removable pieces have a hex screw keyed to that same tool, so you can easily change the plates. The palm rest has a small lever on the right side just underneath the shell that when pressed in, allows you to slide that entire plate forward or back so you can find a comfortable setting for your hand. Setting this plate correctly for your hand will also keep you from hitting the tool when its in the mouse.
To put it in the context you suggested, "Wheel of Fortune". It does not retain any real inertia, and basically only moves when you have your finger on it.
yess, it has a plate that you can put on the right side that you can rest all your fingers on, and the pam rest goes out almost liek 2 and a half inches max, but there is also a 2ndary palm rest that is higher up that will fit even larger hands
only the dpi indicator, the mode changing button and the front of the main mouse buttons light up,but there is a gap infron of the buttons, so when the mouse is resting, it looks like a cross of light is projected infront of the mouse on whatever the mouse is resting on
Mouse holds up just fine. I love all the features and the way onlookers ogle over the mouse. I like the weight of the mouse and it's flexibility. I would suggest however if you have large hands to keep looking. This particular mouse almost fits my hand and I find myself holding it in odd positions that make my hand cramp up after long use. Overall I would give it four and a half out of five stars. Hope this helps.
Mine was in English.
It comes with a manual in PDF form that is 1,000 pages long...lol As for QRH, it's mostly click on buttons/instruments with mouse in the virtual cockpit
Yes.
Yes you most certainly can. You just use the serial number in the box set to download the update. Make sure you buy the box set new not used
This is an add on for Flight Simulator X. It is not stand alone.
Hi Cameron, the 800/900 is the base package. The 600/700 is the add-on for the base package and is purchased separately. However, if you have FS2004 all 4 series are included!
No, it only works with FSX and must upgrade to service pack 2 (this is downloaded online)
The minimum operating system requirements I will state right off the hard copy package I have: "Microsoft Flight Simulator X (SP2) (which is FSX Special Performance 2), Intel Dual Core or similar, Video Card Direct X 9 with 512 MB, with minimum operating system XP/Vista/7, 3 GB free hard disc space, and 2 GB RAM. SHort Answer for FS 2004: No.
I run it on win 7. No lags and other problems.
It comes with a pretty decent number of liveries...mostly all of the major airlines from what I recall. If there's one you don't see, you may be able to find it elsewhere online. If you can afford it, I'd also suggest the PMDG 777!!
Yep. Playing on Windows 8! Brian
No
Hello Caleb I am sorry but I bought this game for the son of a friend and all he needed was that game in english.
No
Yes it work perfectly
hi and yes you can with the (logitech G27) joystick
Yes Euro truck simulator 2 is comparable with a G27 steering wheel.
Yes. Everything works well. In the game you can set the transmission style to H-shifter and use the gear shift
Yes it will.. That's what it was made for.
The kinect is a very sensitive device an struggles with compatibility im pretty sure there not compatible with each other
Not sure.
There is a female connection, but it's for the male portion of the kinect to plug into. (The kinect looks like a usb male connection but it has a bevel corner)
I don't know for sure, but it would probably work. I would think it would be harder to overlay on the screen though, since you use the buttons on the right to line up the film before you place it.
Original... The slim version didn't even exist by the time I bought this product.
This kit is made for the original PS Vita. Ear buds sound great, pocket pouch fits perfect and snug.
no
Yep that's what I bought it for. Works good for a thin sided carrying case
Yes the Vita fits perfect in the soft cover case. The cards fit in the hard case that comes with this kit.
hi, i am a seller but you need to contact amazon to ask them about if you can buy 8 and if they can ship it to verezuela, i have only 1 thanks
I only have a black one. I'm not sure if it comes in any other colors.
It is very light.
yes it should...the ps vita 2000 vs the 1000 has very little differences...the front and back of the console are pretty much the same thing except the 2000 is thinner and slimmer and it has an lcd screen instead of the oled. just like how apple always comes out with new models for the ipad but the exterior pretty much looks the same as the previous model
yes it does
I do not think so. You could still see fingerprints especially when you sweating a lot. However, it do protect the screen.
Got about 2mm extra on each side of lines up correctly.
Like a glove
Yes, but I'd recommend an XL model with its 90% larger screens and better build quality. (EDIT: The XL is also backwards compatible...realized that might not be clear from my post!)
You can but there are some aspect like blowing into the microphone slot thing from the first DS that doesn't seem to work anymore, or for me to get around it, I'll have to dig around in some forums. But I dug out my old Sims 2 game and it worked until I got to that glitch.
No
The 3DS is region locked.
Yes this is a US version of the 3DS
no idea
Most US based companies that produce electronics work out of China but the product seems to work fine
Most likely the one with the higher price has the newest update, but if you connect it to WiFi it will automatically update for free.
No
No , you have to buy the games.
yes I use Windows 8
Your question is too general for a simple "Yes/No" answer. I assume you are referring to the buttons and switches in the cockpit simulations? Firstly, it depends upon which aircraft simulation you are using - some of them, like the Cessna 172 are well-supported, and others have less complete support. Most of the commercially available plane simulations for X-Plane have very well-equipped simulations Then, what do you mean "do what they are supposed to do". Switches for flaps, and turning on an off lights etc normally are pretty realistic. Some of the more complex GPS navigational equipment is not 100% identical in function to the equipment in the real aircraft, but most normal users are unlikely to be affected by that. Most radio navigational equipment works as expected. Generally X-Plane cockpit simulations are pretty good.
Shelly, I Have A Brand New Acer Computer With A 64 Bit System And All The Necessary Equipment To Run xplane 10, My Problem Is Not The Computer. It Is Setting Up The Game Operation. For Instance, I Can't Get The Null Zones Properly Set For Positive Control Of The Airplanes, In Addition, The Throttle Will Not Decrease To 600 Rpm During Landing Approach, It Decreased To 1000 rpm. Very Hard To Control Landings.my Last Flt Sim. Game Was 95, Lots Of Changes Plus This Game Is More REal. I Am Going To Contact X-Plane Support For Both Problems. It's Getting Better. Thank You
Spanish is included on the disc, you have to choose it when you are installing the game.
You need to contact the vendor directly. This is for questions about how to use the product or its features.
It only states that you will need 75gb for the entire scenery.
There are tons of add-ons available. It works within the community of x-plane.org. There you can find freeware and payware add-ons. For example, you can download or purchase aircraft, utilities, etc... Here are a few sites to check out, they are all related to X-Plane 9 or 10 http://www.x-plane.org/ http://store.x-plane.org/ http://shadetreemicro.com/ http://www.c74.net/xplane/_xpo_coop.html http://www.petersaircraft.com/
Not sure . :(
Yes, but highly recommend you go to Windows 7. Skip 8!
Yes
I haven't had any problems like that up to this date. I was actually suprised by the quality of this hard drive because it looks like an exact clone to the Microsoft one. I know this doesn't really answer your question and that's because I haven't in countered your problem. I am not going to swear by this HDD as the reading might be your Xbox or might be the HDD if your looking to buy it do it. It's insanely great quality for the price.
I put an Xbox 1 game in and got an error message :-(
The hard drive has nothing to do with being able to play an original Xbox game on the 360. Take a look at the wiki page for compatible games https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Xbox_games_compatible_with_Xbox_360
There is a cover on the right back side that you pull off. Pull out the old drive and plug in the new.
The one I bought had a 30 day warrantee from the seller. Did you check with the seller you bought from to see if they had a warrantee? not all sellers do this.
Yes, this hard drive will be able to hold any game install up to 250 GB. I've installed battle field 3 and it works fine.
Yes it is compatible with the Slim edition of the 360.
By "originally associated" do you mean made or certified by Microsoft? It is not made by Microsoft, and I'm not sure, but I think it is not Microsoft certified. However, the disk works excellent. I just unpacked and plugged, and it worked. I have downloaded a lot of games and I still have plenty of space. I have not had any issue with it so far. I've been using the disk for over 7 months now. I hope this helps :)
My son has had this for about 8 months. No problems. I was worried about the durability because he actually removes it almost daily to go back and forth from moms to dads house to keep all his game data current while playing xbox at either house. He has taken it to friends house and plugged it in there to access his data, he did have to log in as himself. So worth the price. So glad we got it. No problems with DLC add ons or games.
You just stick it in the Xbox 360 slim and move your files from internal storage to the hard drive. When you first play a game it will ask you which save device to save on and you need to say the hard drive.
It uses steam as the DRM so the only difference is who you're buying it from. It'll act the same as if you bought the game from steam once you redeem the code you get. If steam has a Mac option then it should work.
I run it on my W8.1 laptop. Should work with any decent Windows computer - I believe that any program that ran on W7 is backward compatible with newer windows OSs.
We have't tried 8.1 but it does work with 8.0.
Indeed it does. All of CKII and its respective DLC are Steam managed DRM.
No

Both.
Mike the X32 uses two AAA batteries. Not sure how long it lasts, but I'd get some rechargeable ones and just swap them out.
YOu need a new talkback cable http://www.turtlebeach.com/product-detail/cables-parts/ear-force-xtc/348 or on Amazon http://www.amazon.com/Turtle-Beach-Force-Xbox-360-Talkback/dp/B00B08REVE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1418737551&sr=8-1&keywords=xbox+360+talkback+cable
Your headset receives whatever sounds are coming over your TV. You can hear your games just as much as you can on your TV. In fact, if you need, you will hear your standard TV channels, DVDs, etc., over your headset
If you purchase a Xbox One headset adapter you can use the X32 with an Xbox One and you won't need to use your Kinect for chat. For chat you would run a cord from the headset to the adapter, which lugs into the Xbox One wireless game controller. http://www.turtlebeach.com/products/accessories/xbox-one-adapters.
Yea you hear everything..which side from behind...youll love the way it sounds when you become the predator or Michael Meyers
No the WiFi receiver is programed to one headset at a time.
Mic sounds great and no one online has complained about my mic. can hear everyone else great too.
You do not need to purchase anything for it to work on your Xbox 360. These type of headphones do not work with the Xbox one
It comes with a digital optical cable, a USB cable for power, and a 3.5mm cable. You can see a parts diagram here http://www.turtlebeach.com/assets/products/33/DSS2_in_the_box.jpg
Yes it does it work really good with ps3 I love it
Hello Bat, Could you please clarify what you mean by external sound? I would be glad to answer you question as soon as you do that favor.
Head over to the turtle beach website and all the spec diff will be explained.
Your headset would need to be compatible with surround sound. And its simulated surround not true. I'm not familiar with the stealth but if it came as a stereo then this will not help you.
You will get the sorround effect but it will be much less effective because you will listen to both speakers in both ears. This mix may fool your perception of the sound position intended from the game. For a stereo speaker set up I would not recommend it.
it really depends on your headset but if you just want to get game audio to your headset, you need to plug in the optical digital cable that comes with this device into the back of your xbox one and the other end to this device. then plug in the usb cord to one of the usb ports on your xbox one. then you just plug in your headphones to the front of the Dss2. which headset do you have? Edit: forgot to mention that you need to go into the xbox one settings and find the audio section and make the optical digital audio on
Yes. It will work with any device that has digital optical output.
You can connect the audio output on this unit to the input of the unit for the wireless headphones and it does work. I used x32's in this fashion and it works perfectly.
I doubt it... This is designed for a headset, not a soundbar.
Yes, it comes with the headphones, transmitter, & the cables. It should have everything you need! If you are getting them for games like Call of Duty you will love them! It's like hearing online for the first time!
Louise, you would also have to purchase an Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter sold by Microsoft. And then you would use the Xbox 360 talkback cable that comes with the X42 and run that cable from the headset to the adapter, which connects to the controller, for chat. So yes you can use it, but you are tethereed to the controller and you need to purchase an adapter. The only 100 percent wireless headset on the market for the Xbox One is the Stealth 500X.
wireless as in dont need a 12ft cord going across your room? then yes its wireless... but a 2ft cord from headset to controller? no
This is a juicy question. All headset surround sound is 'virtual' -- digital signal processing is used to give you a surround sound experience. I won't get into the math. That said, it is extremely effective, more so than having a typical home theater set-up with multiple speakers. Because your left ear only hears the left channel, and the right ear only hears the right channel, a headset can deliver a really immersive and accurate surround sound signal. There are people who will argue all day long that you need to have multiple speakers in a headset for 'true' surround sound, but actually sticking a bunch of speakers in a small space like that is more likely to create audio chaos than quality surround sound. Trust me on this, I work at a headset company. I wear them when I play and the quality of the surround is amazing. You can also read reviews of our headsets ... the writers all say the same.
2 AAA batteries.
No
Turtle beach made an adapter to fit the Xbox One's controller. The headset will work with PC with sound, but no voice support.
You can route the audio through your TV "if" your TV has an optical output. You would want to check and make sure.
Any wireless headset in your price range for the game machine you own will work just fine. The Turtle Beach Ear Force X42 are affordable and have worked very well for us. They also work for both the xbox 360 and PS4 systems. FWIW.
Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter
Exactly. Some things, like hard drives of the same make, model and series that just have different sizes... those I can see lumping together. But these Razer mice are NOT THE SAME PRODUCT at all. A review of one is not valid for a review of another one. Amazon failed big time combining these.
If you install the Razer software you can set them to anything.
price is depends upon the availability on the market.
Well since I got the razer naga hex league of legends edition I would say yes it is. It has the perfect amount of buttons for how many item slots there are but with season 4 there is now 7 buttons 6 items and 1 trinket so this means you wont be ablr to have the whole bag resdy to go you might have to set some other macro up to use the 6th item slot because thetrinkret will use number 4 or 6 I csnt remember... long story short ya its good for lol ps I sent this on a phone after losing a ranked game at 1:30 AM so idc about sll the typos that this probably has!
The one we bought stopped working after only a few months. Amazon has only a 30 day return policy so we contacted the manufacturer and they are supposed to replace.
No
It's a plastic nub that pops in. Has different sizes.
It is not wireless. Gamers prefer wired accessories because the respond speed is much faster than wireless mouses, plus with the Razer Naga Hex the wire is different than wires compared to the iPhone in which are easier to break when pulled.
Yes it can move to the right only
Yes. Razor's Synapse software works great on Macs.
Please note the following from the Turtlebeach Support website: "The... XP400, PX5, XP500, Tango, X-Ray, Delta, and Phantom headsets were designed for use with PS3 and Xbox 360 game consoles. It is only possible to use these headsets on a PC or Mac if you have the correct configuration and hardware. We recommend using one of our many PC compatible models instead, such as the PX3 or Z300." I do not have the Bluetooth setup to use on my PC, so half of the function of the headphones is lost to me unless I spend extra money and time figuring it out. IF YOU ARE BUYING THIS FOR PC, GET SOMETHING ELSE FROM TURTLEBEACH.
It supposed to be once you buy the adapter for xbox one. Check turtlebeach.com just in case. I know they have instructions and stuff on there
Technically speaking the console has less to do with the quality of the sound, if not related at all. However the game its self will affect the quality of the surround sound features. If you play newer games that support dolby digital youll be fine. Hope this statement helps! - Jake
Yes you can, it's great so you don't scream every time you speak. Also you can adjust the volume in which you can hear your self.
Yes. The transmitter does have a 3.5mm port to allow it to connect to any portable device or T.V.
I'm not sure how much power it draws, but I do know that drivers may be an issue as these will not work with Linux without a fair bit of work. So the TV may not transmit poperly. if my TV has a USB input I may try it out and let you know.
No it cannot. The bluetooth is use for chatting or speaking with the Mic wirelessly. If you want the smarthphone to sync with music then the XP510 is capable everything
You can't. As soon as it detects audio from the analog in, it goes to that one instead.
The headset and transmitting piece it comes with has many options. It comes with an optical cord which is the main audio output of most modern gaming systems (hence why it's made for Xbox as both the 360 and One use this output). The transmitter also has an option auxiliary input so you can use the headset for computers or even phones. The headset does not come with this cord but these types of cords aren't hard to find. As for the headset, it has Bluetooth and a 3mm output that can only be used for controllers or chat adapters. There is no main input on the headset as the transmitter handles this.
Yup. I do. The only trick with these headphones is you have to buy the cable and special adapter for the X-Box One for chat to work with the X-Box One.

Yes, it is frustrating... but in a good way. The key to the Soul's games is to block with a shield; so watch your enemy and raise your shield as he moves to strike. This will open them up to an attack by you. Once this is learned it really gets fun!! but remember... all enemies are DIFFERENT! It's about timing! Hope that helps! Good Luck!
no its a single player game, but there is a lot of features that require an internet connection. caps lock is cruise control for cool
No, It has only a online mode where you can play but not in private, some player can put a signal on the floor and you can invoke the spirit of him for your help.
Yes, Spanish subs.
you can, you can get health regain rings, the problem with the game I found not to my liking is that if you die, you start with less health compared to other games that you start with full health, the game is really difficult for me even at normal mode
Be wary of recklessness
Impossible to say what causes lost connection as the message on screen does not tell you - it just says "lost connection" so can be any type of fault (you or them)
No I don't think.but the first one was great I would give it a shot
Yes, Yes, Yes. I played the game for 3 hours, saved and turned the console off. When I turned the game back on all my "money" or souls were gone and I was back to the beginning. So unless you have time to kill, F this game.
I felt like it was faster paced and smoother. They did take away the kick and added some stupid shield break which is almost useless. If you where obsessed with DS1 then you should definitely play DS2. It's for sure an upgrade.
It depends on how good your computer is. If you have a good graphics card and processer, then yes it will run on windows 7
No. A game will not cause viruses.
It actually works amazing on windows 8.1
well half the island is locked unless you use a flating car cheat to get to the other side of the island than it has a freemode. GTA Vice City is the same as almost anyother grand theft auto game except it has a Miami Vice or Scar Face feel to it. All Rockstars GTA games are sandboxes(meaning you can move around the map without doing missions).

No, u can still play online. Luckely you will still have 5 characters included no need any codes n u can play with your 4 friends in tag fight which is two agaisnt two as a team. This game is worth it n one of the best of all MK games.
all characters shown including freddy and kratos are included in the game, ready to play. just go to the bottom left or right corner of the boxes you choose your player from and you get the option to choose them.
Well, the ome I got, come on the disc.
Yes. It comes with every skin unlocked already. :)
No it doesn't come with any PSN avatars. You have to buy those from the Playstation Store separately.
Yes, it does.
Disc.
Yes you should, unless the Disc Type is not compatible in Japan or on Japanese (as u say) PS3 devices. Mine is BLUS30902GH
It is a 2-dimensional platform fighting game with opponents facing each other.
It is a Blu Ray game. It has excellent quality I used to have it on 360 and it looks tons better with the Blu Ray format.
Officially ATT, but there is a work around to save tons of money. Most people do not know it, but TracFone owns ATT, they are also behind the Straight Talk cut rate service provider at Wal-Mart. What you do, is buy the sim from Wal-mart (couple of bucks) then get the data only plan. Use the associated website to top it off once a month, or only when traveling. You get the same network, but at dirt cheap pricing. (PS, also works great for most ATT phones, it must have a sim. My phone plan went from over $150 to $50)
The vita, a 4 gb Sim card, USB cable, ac adapter, ac power cord, printed materials.
Yes you can use it with regular wifi, I use it every day without any 3g chip in it.
I'm not sure why exactly but only AT&T provides the Vita's 3G capabilities. I just use mine on wifi when available.
Depends on if you have the Wi-Fi on or off, if you have it on it's going to drain the battery. Say 3 hours or so? Without it 4 hours, but I believe you can shut off the system without powering it off completely to conserve power.
mp3 mp4 wma. I'm sure it plays others but I haven't tried any other ones yet.
I don't believe it is locked. My Vita when I bought it from here came with a sim card for at&t so I'm guessing that you could just put another in because Sony says it's not locked to any specific carrier.
If you have 3G on your psvita, then yes. .
No
The Vita with 3G had the ability to go online anywhere you want but you have to purchase a plan from AT&T.
This will NOT work for the playstation 3 as it only has a small jack that is customary on laptops, phones ect. You will either need to get a wireless headset or look into getting the Sony pulse. If you want to get a cheap mic, use the official Sony branded blutooth headset that pairs automatically with your PS3. Hope this helps :)
I'm not sure how well this exact model will work for that since the mic is in the cord about 5-6" down. I'd definitely recommend one of their headsets with the mic that positions in front of the mouth. I have a Turtle Beach PX22 at home that I use on Skype and it works very well. As far as the background noise goes that's going to be more with the software you use. In my experience Skype definitely picked up on the background noise from all parties in the calls.
Completely fixed
The M5 cable does not detach so I do not think you can replace it.
It's more for tablet or ipod, it has a 3.5mm jack, it will work with an xbox 360 if you get an adapter
I use them for gaming and watching movies on Xbox, tablet and computer. Very decent sound! Only had to send them in for warranty replacement due to all of a sudden they started messing but turtle beach sent me an upgraded pair M7 I think.
No
The headphones come with an adapter that splits into 2 jacks. One for recieving audio& another for the microphone
No, this isnt a gaming set though, has no chat mic and doesnt fit with controllers
Sorry I don't think it does but if you go to turtle beach.com the website will inform you better than I can.
This is for the original vita system. You have to place the system in the grips at an angle. Where the top buttons are on the vita, they go in first at a downward angle, then the rest of the system snaps right in.
Here the 2k model www.amazon.com/Vita-2000-Trigger-Grip-Sony-PSP/dp/B00JYE8L9K/
Probably not because this case doesnt not leave any space
the trigger grips are really worth it. Like all products, there will be wear and tear but it depends on how much and how vigorously you use them. Honestly I used them so much, that I can't play without them. Get them bro.
Of course and you can easily remove or insert your PS vita from the case AT THE SAME TIME as your charging and have earphones plugged in. This case gives you access to all ports except the Sim card port on the 3g model.
I don't use my Vita a ton but I found the grip very nice for racing games. There is play in the triggers so it's not great for a FPS but I loved it for NFS.
I use a kindle fire soft case from Belkin and it fits perfect with the grip, lots of protection too. Got it at target. I took the grip with me to figure out what would fit.
No it doesnt. I also would recommend abother product like the Nyko grips
No, you can still use the rear touch pad
http://www.amazon.com/Vita-2000-Trigger-Grip-Sony-PSP/dp/B00JYE8L9K/ref=pd_sim_vg_6?ie=UTF8&refRID=13J63RJWF0CP4B2RVKTY
It's always blue.
I have used this mouse on both Windows 7 and Windows 8 (without the need to install the drivers that are included with the disc) and can report there have been no issues or "quirks" with this mouse on either OS. This is the best mouse I have ever owned (it took me years to upgrade from my old Intellimouse Explorer -- which is now discontinued).
Yes it does and quite well.
Not really, it moves the cursor and left/right/scroll buttons click but no further customization. Logitech has some decent ones that provide mac drivers and you get to use/map the extra buttons. I have a second one of these at home now since I switched to a mac at work and swapped to a logitech. Shrug, great mouse but only worth it for windows.
Nope, just the one ball controller.
I bought two of these and received them in the mail yesterday. Mine both came with charging cables that you can plug directly into the ps3, or any usb charging device. I recommend doing what I did, and just buy a charge station if you have multiple controllers. So much easier to manage. Hope this helps.
yes the eye is what the remote goes by.double check the game it should tell u what u need .
I'm guessing but I assume it means buying in bulk. Large quantities of an item.
Yes the Move Motion Controller does work on the PS4 and PS3. Tested with Just Dance on the PS4
no, it does not. The controller will work with the new PS4 Eye, but the Playstation Eye included in this pack is only designed for the PS3.
All parts separately and they are all original
it's battery operated
Hi, the bundle that we purchased included: the move controller, the eye camera and the playstation move demo disc. You will have to purchase games separately. I'm including a link with some useful information about the PS3 move setup: https://support.us.playstation.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2092/~/playstation%C2%AEmove-setup We are satisfied with this purchase.
No, it does not but Playstation does sell a mounting clip that is sold through Amazon. Here is some information regarding the mounting clip that I found... The officially Sony licensed PS3 Eye Camera Mounting Clip conveniently mounts the PlayStation Eye camera on flat panel televisions. The clip holds the EYE camera in perfect position for Move gameplay and features a wide range of adjustable settings for various flat-panel HDTV shapes. The Mounting Clip is easy to use straight out of the box with no need to use any adhesive.PlayStation Move and PlayStation Eye Camera each sold separately. The current price is $28.99
It is charged by the same mini USB that charges the Dualshock 3. Mine was used so it did not include a charging cord. I'd assume the new ones do. Also, no it does not come with a gun. But you can find them online and in stores for CHEAP.
I've never used the Navigation Controller. Never had to. All the games and functions are accessible using the Move or the regular 6-way controllers.
A lot of the games you won't be able to play without it.
No just one.
Sorry, I gave it as a gift, I dont know
yes the cable work with out the battery, plus it keeps your controller on with the charging cable pluged in the controller. but it wont carge your controller on it own with out charging battery that is attached to the controller, it would need a charging battery that can be charged to keep the controller on and active.
My son tried this. It does not work. There may be some usb drivers available that would make it work but we have never looked.
I could never get it to work on my PC except for charging. I ended up buying an xbox 360 wireless usb receiver for it instead.
No
I'm not sure cuz my cable riped cuz they crossed and pulled it off so it I put it on my Xbox control and didn't turn on so I'm not sure if it's the cable or the pc that doesn't for it so check it for yourself and see if it works
Yes it will just plug this cable into your controller and then plug it in your PC to update the cord and its drivers so it can be able to charge your controller on the PC and Xbox console you'll know it'll work once after it installs your the cord drivers to your PC the red light will come on on the cord. To play with the wireless controller on your PC while being plugged up just go to your device manager and scroll all the way at the bottom and select your controller properties and then select its wireless playback drivers for your PC to Xbox controller.
no you need a http://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Pc-Gaming-Receiver-Xbox-xbox360/dp/B0076HD2W8/ref=sr_1_3?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1405580456&sr=1-3&keywords=xbox+360+wireless+adapter if its a wireless controller and the battery charger you asked about or a wired controller
Starting from the far left, the first one is a rewind button, the second play/pause, the third is fast forward, the fourth is mute, the fifth decreases volume, and the sixth increases it. I dont personally know what the rewind pause/play and fast forward buttons are for.
No, It is wired.
the standard length, dont expect anything special from this keyboard, it is a bottom of the line gaming keyboard that works surprisingly well
Trust me I have owned the Razer Black Widow and this keyboard feels good, but is not mechanical in any way.
It did not come with black keys. This is a pretty average membrane keyboard and if you don't want orange keys, you shouldn't buy the keyboard.
It will work, the Windows and Alt key will act as the Command and Options key. Although, they will be reversed, this can be fixed with a program called Double Command.
Yes
Probably close to 4 foot long.
yes works with windows 8
I'm not sure, but for this price I'm assuming simply a membrane type. It does have a nice tactile feel.
Yes, I bought it on Amazon and they sent me the game but I had to use Steam to play. Steam is ok except it can be a pain in the butt to log on with their password system. The game is very good. I think if you buy the game and not the download you should not have to fool with 3rd party sites to play the game.
If your machine is less then three years old and you have a Windows install to boot, you can.
Yes, It is the current operating program on my Desk top computer , the game says both 7 and Vista.
Yes
NO IDEA!
yes plus they auto update each time you start the game
From the website: http://us-ci-games.gamesplanet.com/shop/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/ OS : Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7, with the latest Service Pack CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo at 2Ghz, or AMD Athlon 64 x2 2Ghz, or better RAM: 2GB Video Card: NVidia 8800GT with 512MB RAM or better HDD: 9GB DirectX: 9.0c and a DirectX Compatible Sound Card
Yes. If it does not auto-detect, go to the device manager and look for it. It will likely be listed as "Unknown Hardware" Right-click, update driver, browse to the bottom of the list and "XBOX 360 Peripherals and accessories" or something to that effect will be listed. Select this and the list of hardware will appear. Choose the XBOX 360 Wireless receiver and go through the install process. The controller/receiver will be installed. Just confirmed it by installing about five minutes ago in Win8.1.
I have connected at least 2 controllers. I believe a single unit will connect up to 4.
Yes use it everyday
Yes, that is what I'm running at home and it works perfectly.
Yes. The cd is useless anyway. Look at this vid. http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kxa5CJsDzwQ
There is a third party driver you can get that makes it work. http://tattiebogle.net/index.php/ProjectRoot/Xbox360Controller/OsxDriver
Reports from others online suggest that the Microsoft Branded USB Receiver DOES work with the Amazon Fire TV. Has anyone who's bought THIS one had the chance to try it out with the Fire TV?
When I bought the gaming receiver, the CD didn't really help with installation so I looked online for installation software. You can install the software from the Windows website: http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/xbox-360-wireless-controller-for-windows And if you have problems even after installing the software, check out this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJSzC7mrduU&src_vid=InwN0fyHy0w&feature=iv&annotation_id=annotation_3692610237 When you first install the receiver, your computer probably won't recognize it as a receiver. The video will teach both how to install it and how to make it easier for the computer to recognize.
If you're using Microsoft you should be able to browse your computer for the drivers (Windows 7: Devices and Printers - right click USB Receiver for properties - click hardware tab - properties - driver tab - update driver - browse computer. There may be multiple options provided by Microsoft "Xbox 360 Controller for Windows," if the first one doesn't work try the next).
http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/xbox-360-controller-for-windows here to update Drivers and then this how you sync your pc to your controller https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaqFQkSrikA
The answer is yes. I also have the original Vita and it works great.
No. Fat version only (1000 series)
I think it has to do with how you charge it. I thought mine wasn't holding a charge after a few months, but what I found is that if you charge the Power Grip and Vita separately, then it holds its full charge. I don't recall if the manual says to do that, but that's what works for me. I get a full week out of mine on one charge, no problem (one hour train commute to and from work and some time before bed here and there).
I bought this because it is the most comfortable grip out there. I have the portable charger as well, but the benefit the power grip has over the external battery is that there are no wires if you are charging the Vita with it. If that doesn't bother you then it is just a really nice grip that happens to charge the vita as well.
Yes it should definitely work.
No I don't believe so
no it does not come with a charger
Yes the port on the bottom of the grip allows you to be plugged in while it is on the vita (in the event you forgot to charge the grip and Vita and are both dead). Personally I never ran into this issue as the grip gives you that second charge for your vita :)
Yes it will fit. The Vita is placed into the Nyko grip at an angle (Top first and then bottom) and once it's resting in the grip there will be only a slight latch on the top and bottom to partially secure it. The main way the Vita is secured is by the locking mechanism on the bottom side at the charging port. The Hori should not ever be affected by what little this grip actually is touching on the Vita's face.
I got it new from cheek up a seller in japan they have never let me down before so i think you will be happy
No.
Yes it would
I'm not sure as I don't have HP touch screen. Sorry.
Carnival, Cash Climb, Chocolate, Dance Electric, Dinosaurs, En Fuego, Fireworks, Fishn' Fortune, Going Once, HO!HO! Dough, Mirage, Order in the Court. BTW, I am running Windows 7 and this game only plays in a small window. It might be better in other operating systems but it sucks in Windows 7.
On my laptop must be played in "windowed" form only. Good games, lot of fun.
You are in luck! When you open the game, you actually have two options for languet. You can either choose dubbed english version, or original Japaneese voices. If you choose the english dubbed version, most of the game will have subtitles, but there will be cut-scenes with no subtitles at all. How-ever, if you choose the original japaneese dub, Every-thing will have subtitles including animated cut-scenes! So when you are on the main-menu of the game, go to "Settings." choose "Languetes." and then choose original Japaneese voices, the entire game will have english subtitles ^^
Yes, it does.
yes it does
It has both I believe.
You can select the language in which the text will display and spanish is an option. The game audio can be chosen as well english or Japanese.
No
Yes it does :). In the setup you can choose the languages From English French and Spanish
Yes it can. Japanese voice English dubbed is a option.
After installation it totals at 3,847 MB or 3.8 GB. I don't believe there is any updates for it though.
I received it in a box

yes, it says it works on mac as fare as anything else you can't read their writing nor can you understand and of the printing in the paperwork or on the box? buy it dose say it works on Windows Vista, 98/me/200/and XP and mac I am using it on my windows 7 professional
It has 2 on the left side, 1 left mouse button, 1 right mouse button, and the scroll wheel can be clicked in. There is also a dpi changer behind the scroll wheel, Idk if you can change that to whatever you want though.
Yes it does
Absolutely. Works perfectly.
I'm just using stock mouse controls and using a pc.
Yes it does.
Yes it works with windows 8
the light is very bright and if you are looking for a mouse that can handle ton's of play or work time this is the one to get
It has four different languages, English, French, Spanish and Portuguese. You can change the text, subtitles and speech, and all of this can be found in the options. If you have any other question I am more then happy to help, I love this game and the story line.
Because of the misuse of improper footwear in a apocalyptic society gone awry. The amount of gangrene that the two players should have died from due to not taking the time to show proper footwear usage and choices is just appalling. The ESRB saw this and thought about how many kids could be influenced by this game and wear wrong shoes and die an early age so they slapped an M on it. Oh and the violence, blood and cursing as well attributed to the M.
There are subtitles. Being not native English speaker I'm still using them myself... You will loose some atmosphere definitely because of not being able to hear surroundings which are done in absolutely amazing way :(.. But I still think you will enjoy it and the game provides "high awareness" mode when the hero "hear" through walls (you both hear the sounds on long distances *and* see the silhouettes through obstacles) - so should be good to go.
Survival Edition is a collector's item. (I'm pretty sure) it comes with a statuette and the Pandemic Edition also comes with "The Art of The Last of Us". Hope I helped!
Yes. This game is rated 17+ for everything from violence and language to gore and nudity. This is an extremely dark game that is aimed towards a mature audience.
It has multiplayer modes but the single player storyline game is solo.
You play as the guy (Joel) for the majority of the game but play as girl (Ellie) for a small part. You can't switch charecters though.
No, but they are scary to beat when they outnumber you 4 to 1. That's what makes it fun!!
You tell me man. Makes no sense.
It will release this year with more better graphics & included all DLC's & multiplayers maps
Yes, It's compatible. I have in running on my desktop and my surface pro. Both 8.1
With the limited edition, you get a few more add-ons. Other than that, there is not a difference. Also, we have not had any problems with the game other than it takes awhile to install because of the size. It is a lot more realistic than it use to be.
I am not selling anything, the game has drm and is tied to an account once activated. I simply wrote the review to help future customers with their purchases. The limited was a pre order special that came with a couple digital extras and a beta. As far as SimCity standard, it is the same as limited, I believe deluxe is the one with all the bells and whistles with digital content.
Yes I believe so and its linked to one email and password.
yes it does work with Windows 7
Yes
Yeah before doing so you should install a anti-virus system probably Webroot is the best. The only reason you should install a anti-virus is so you won't end up having a virus like I did.
Yes because Sim city connects and is run by EA though u can go offline EA requires u to have and enter a key through origin
Correct. The other advantages of single player mode are that the space center work is not bugged and that the prices of the goods are steady and do not swing around. The one disadvantage is that you don't get achievements.
I don't know on that one...might check its compatibility on the website.
Yes it works on mine
Yes
Even if it did, I wouldn't get it. Mine lasted about a month and quit working. I use my ps3 about 2 times a week if even. So that should tell you something about the device.
I'm just saying from my experience that it fried my turtle beaches and a racing wheel so I would use it
This will work with as many as the Bluetooth can handle. I can plug in all 5 of my Rockband instruments and still use the controllers You may have to manually program the controller numbers on some but yes they would all work
read my review this thing is a piece of junk
it is account bound so all characters
Yes, definitely can, and absolutely worth it too! (You even still get Founder's status added to your account, heh. I bought it for the toon unlocks, and that plus the mount alone was worth it, let alone the other cool stuff in the box)
No you will not have to start over again, this will just give you all the perks of being a founder with out paying out the nose. here is the financial bits from my previous review of this item. Once you play one character and type, you're going to want to eventually try them all not to mention open your bank slots (as you acquire a lot of stuff fairly quickly). This is what prompted me to buy a copy the game even though is now free to play. By doing the math I found that the EMP (cash shop dollars for the game) to dollar ratio is about 100:1 (100 points for every dollar) a single character slot is 495 EMP or 3960 EMP to unlock all 8, BUT only for one server! That's a little over $39. Then when you add in the cost of expanding your bank slots that's an additional 495 EMP for 1 slot or 1320 EMP for all 3, costing an additional $5-$13. So in the end you would end up paying between $54.45 - $52.80 just for upgrades on ONE server. So that in mind I decided to buy a physical copy, which will give me all 8 character slots & all 4 bank slots in all the servers not to mention 3 pages instead of 1 in the Brokerage (Player's Market), to save myself money in the long run. I also decided to spend an additional $15 and upgrade to the collectors edition simply to get all the nifty extras! The review by Catpsyche really says it all for why I did. But even then I still saved money! Also just some advice, but if you are going to buy something from the EMP shop save yourself money in the long run and always buy permanent!
Mine did not come with a soundtrack
Na
You can install Tera on as many PCs as you like. However, the code of goodies is tied to your online account with which you registered on Tera (eg. Mark@someemail.com). Hope this helps.
The mounts are included in the activation code. After activation, you can find them in the Item Claim tab on the in-game menu; under account-bound items. All your characters can use them.
Yes, this is the one for the US server because it's published by En Masse. The EU publisher is Gameforge.
yes, it opens all of the available character slots, which I believe are 8 per server. I would suggest reading through the reviews below most of your questions could be answered, as there are a lot of very reliable reviews available. here is mine :http://www.amazon.com/review/R9N8XAQ5U81MC/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm you'll also save a lot of money in the long run by buying a copy. but what is included in the CE when you enter the code (enter it both forwards then again backwards): The pack comes with: - Founder Title - 8 character slots (including the 2 given to you) - 4 Bank Slots - Tawny Lion - 2 Semi-Enigmatic Scrolls - 2 Emeralds - Lv 15 Necklace (Account Bound) - Lv 40 Necklace (Account Bound) - Warhorse Mount (Account Bound) - Frost Lion Mount (Account Bound)
Yes
Friends, I bought this disk. It took me longer to figure out WHERE it when, then to install it. this was my second xbox 360 experience in like 5 years. my other uses have been 4 or 5 years ago. It seems like this system the slim, adds an extra step to the save and load process. to ask you WHERE you want to get the data, your 4 mg internal memory, your NEWly installed hard drive, or the cloud. I think that step interfers with the OLD xbox functionality, so they do not work. They mean the old xbox, NOT the xbox 360. so your 360 games should all work fine, I have tried like 12+ games, and they all worked. But I never tried a xbox game. I am happy with this disk, except for the extra step the slim added. Thank you. Dr. Darrell of michigan.
It's definitely big enough to store the entire game, if that's what you're asking.
Yes you can play destiny
I can't say, but I CAN say that this drive didn't work and upon asking to return it the company didn't even want it back. Buy a Microsoft drive. They cost more, but they'll work.
From what I understand, all "Slim" labeled hard drives work just as well on the E systems, since they didn't change anything about hard drives in between the two.
1year
hasn't happened to my son.......do you leave the xbox on for long periods? When our computer monitor had heat issues, we bought a small fan that runs whenever the monitor is on and that fixed the overheating problem......
Some games are reverse compatible with a hard drive. Not all original Xbox games are. If the hdd works then yes you should be able to but I would buy it at a game stop location to be on the safe side that way if it does not you can still return it fairly easily.
Yea this controller is definitely a third party controller. To be honest I bought this because it was cheap but for some reason I kept getting shocked by the controller. Eventually it was unbearable and persistent to the point where I sent it back and just bought a microsoft controller. No complaints since then.
I did not use the controller I just returned it, it was not the controller pictured or the controller I ordered! I would not buy from this seller!
It works perfectly on windows 8 :). And how it performs? It works for what it is, if agame supports an xbox 360 controller it will work. There might even be some mods or workaround a for games that don't support 360. As for the controller itself, hardware, it's great! Everything feels like it should on a 360 controller.
Yeah it is, that's the reason I got it, I use it with steam all the time. Might be a bit stiff untill you us just the sesitivy settings, works great after.
i tryed and it doesnt seem to i would recommend trying to get refund if thats what got it for
No
yes
could be a compatibility issue - most PC games with controller compatibility are set up to take on-brand xbox controllers, which have a particular kind of input. a lot of off-brand usb controllers have a different kind of input. since the game is set up to only recognize one kind of input, it wont recognize the off-brand controller as a controller at all. x360ce is a controller emulator program you can use to solve this problem. it switches the input so that the game recognizes the controller as a controller. i used it and it worked - you can find the program and tutorials on how to use it with google. it could also be because the controller isnt very good and just doesnt work.
Mine did not work at all! It was plugged into an xbox 360..
The length of time the batteries holds a charge sucks. If you basically play alone they should be fine. If yuo rutinly play with others, you probobly wont be satisfied
It full charges it
yes, 2 of them.
Hi, it works with any battery I have the original batteries and the 2 I received with the charger and they all fit in.
try reconnecting your controller to your xbox 360 here is a video if you need help http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpV-b1de2lM
It is not nyko but I do not know who makes it
Yes
The one battery pack that worked for a short time worked fine.
The batteries that I received fit my controller very well. I would think that if you had old batteries that fit your controller, they would fit the the xbox rechargeable unit.
Same here, I bought two of these chargers, one was fine..the other one had a broken brass strip on it and the battery will not charge on that side. I was wondering the same, how do I get a replacement as this one is obviously defective. I don't want to have to go through the whole process of having to repackage it, sending it out again, and waiting for the replacement. I was very disappointed.

Yes, you can play the Wii version on the Wii U. The Wii U is backwards compatible with all Wii titles.
While it's preferable if you do play the first one as this story refers to the first EM's story and many of the characters make return appearances it is not a must that you play EM before EM2. EM2 will encapsulate the previous story in its cut scenes and it's not that important to be familiar with any character. I didn't find that being familiar with characters from EM enhanced my enjoyment (or lack thereof) of EM2. But I would suggest that you skip EM2 altogether and play through EM, a flawed but satisfying game. EM2 improves on a oft difficult camera (but not by that much) and it's true strength is probably the co-op play it offers but it's not nearly as satisfying a game as the original IMO.
According to this it may work "The controller functions as a Nunchuk when playing Epic Mickey: The Power of Two." [http://www.amazon.com/Epic-Mickey-Mickeys-Paintbrush-Wii-Nintendo/dp/B008FHHT1S]
No, you can use the Wii remote as the paintbrush
No, but parts there are a few parts that are easier with two, but still possible with one.
To answer your question, you do not need the classic controller at all. All you need is the regular Wii controller and nunchuck to play this game. If you want, you can purchase the paint brush nunchuck to make it feel like you are painting, but it is not necessary.
yes i think you can find Spanish in the settings.
All ages, my 9 year old son and my 15-year-old daughter play and we also play, especially when it comes to a solution on a level
This game has a track that require reading, children use their logic at times to find the answer without reading, opportunities are lost and you return to previous game spaces, I recommend starting with Epic one

Yes, it will work with an X41.
It should work as far as I know.
Yes
Yes, this type of cable can be used for Xbox 360 chat with the Phantom headset.
it should but I am not 100% sure
Yes, the Xbox 360 Talkback Cable will work with the PX5 headset.
i don't think so judging by the pictures on the triton website the cable looks like it is permanently fixed into the headset itself, if your having issues i'd say your best bet is to take them back to the store and exchange them. or check out the website http://www.trittonaudio.com/prod/parts.asp
Its 2.5mm. The same size as the xbox controller jack for both ends
If your asking if it works for xbox 1 yes but you still need the adapter also. If your talking about the X1 from turtle beach then you need to upgrade that is old and the cable doesnt disconect. Really old. They dont even sell those anymore. Did you mean x11 or something else?
I'm not sure of the exact measurement but it fits into my Xbox controller just like the one i replaced
includes both; a 256 ssd and a 750 hdd
Windows 7 requires more than 8GB to be stored. In that configuration the OS would be put on the 1TB hard drive. Are you absolutely certain you are buying an 8GB solid state and not a 128GB solid state? 8GB does not hold a lot of data in 2014. If you are indeed purchasing a 128GB solid state then the OS would be loaded on the SSD for performance reasons. That would give you approximately 100GB of usable space for critical applications/games as best practice is keeping your SSD at a minimum of 20% free.
Yeah, for $14.99...I already got the notice from Microsoft that it was ready to download...decided...why mess up a good computer!
It works on USB. ..I don't even hook mine to the playstation
We tried it and it works that way as well.
Yes you can.
the port is a really tight fit. it probably wouldn't work with a skin or anything else that would impede the connection in the slightest.
Yes, it does. The functionality is iffy though. Mine still works but only one of the ports and it's on and off.
No you have to have the rechargeable controllers already. This is just like the cord but two spots for the controllers to sit in. I wouldn't get it though. Mine was a POS. I just threw it away
No, It does not. My boyfriend already had a cord to charge his controllers from the play station. He uses the same cord for the charging stand. If you have one of those it should be fine.
Yes! Awesome maps and campaign dlc! You get to play as Nightwing and Robin! The dlc campaign is pretty cool! Batman has been captured and play as Robin to save him! Arkham City was favorite of the three. Awesome story! Game of the year edition is a must have! Make sure you preorder the next Batman, Arkham Knight, it's going to be epic!
This one Is really good more stuff. But I haven't played original. But this has dlc's
You just download it to the box.
I don't know why the top rated answer said yes. It's a Batman game - there is a small level of violence but it's very tame, showing no blood whatsoever. There is no blood or gore, and shooting is stopped by Batman's armor, and if you were asking if you play as someone who shoots people, Batman only has non-lethal weapons. It's rated T so quite frankly, any kid who is familiar with Batman is probably old enough to play Arkham games.
No My son is 6 and loves it
I believe it's just for the downloadable content
No. Its a one player game if playing offline.
Have you try the system first then the game
There is a lot of violence in this game, but no blood. It's mostly hand-to-hand combat. I believe it's okay for kids 14 and older.
Yeah, you can free roam. There are several sub story lines you can do as well.
You dont need an internet connection for this game. It comes with everything already on the disk, including all of the downloadable content.
Unfortunately it does not. This version is English only audio and subtitles.
As long as the DLCs are available in your local store you can get them, easiest way to tell is loging in with your ps3 and entering the playstation store from there, check if the DLCs for the game are available there (price is always in US dollars no matter your location), if they're available you shouldn't have any problem, i had a US account which i set when i got my ps3, when i wanted to buy Harley's revenge DLC i got a psn card and surprise! it only was good in my country so i had to create a local account and buy it there, then i played on my US account which had all my trophies : ) an even easier solution: get the Game of the Year Edition that has all currently available DLCs in one disc. Since the announcement of Arkham Knight and with Origins already on the market it's not really likely there will be any more DLCs for this game.
Yes this game does have a diffulty option before you start.
No it won't. Ps3 games don't run in ps4 consoles.
Probably the game is used and thats why you dont have it. But if the game is new.... it should have come inside the box. You gotta have a piece of paper with a code on it. If not... contact the seller.
Easy, all the dlc content is on the disc. All u need is Internet access and a psn id and your good to go &#9786;
No only for download content :-)
Yes
Yes
Maybe, but I would rather sell my old keyboard then buy cherry brown keyboard
The backlight is red.
It is i would say. I got the red as well but you only hear a thump, while this has a mechanical metal like click. I wish I could compare it to my IBM m though side by side. Other than going unicomp, mx blue seem like the only alternative
I use this keyboard with Windows 8, and it works fine, software and all.
Sorry to disappoint, the LEDs aren't Blue - however, one of their other products, the CM Storm QuickFire TK, has a blue LED/keyswitch combo, as shown in the description. I hope I helped you. I haven't used that keyboard, but by the quality of the Trigger, I think the Quickfire TK shouldn't disappoint. Apologies if I sound like a salesman! :P
Good for youth very realistic I have an 11 year old who now knows how a real airplane flys and has been inspired to learn how to fly. Highly recomend
Yes
Yes it does.
From the reviews I've read - yes. However I've had no experience in that arena since I am iMac based. Sorry I can't be of more help.
It does come on a cd, and only on a cd
I bought the one that was recommended on the Xplane site at the time. It has some minor issues. Check some gaming sites and ask there.
i have an earlier macbook pro and play X-plane 10 on it. I don't see any reason why not.
It would work better with a joystick. Works on Yosemite too
X Plane 10 may work with your MacBook May, 2006, but it will not be capable to utilize all the programs within X Plane 10. I have been an X Plane user since the old 7.5 days. You will find that X Plane 9 will work well (It did on my MacBook November 2006). However, X Plane 10 was largely a disaster. I recently bought a new iMac with 8 MB of ram and a very fast video card and X Plane works great. Fast, smooth and great graphics with Super Retina Display Hope this is helpful. Happy flying
I'm pretty sure it is
Hard copy and code for play online
If you bought it brand new then yes...idk about pre owned......but my did come with an online pass
These are used games so the pass has been used, mine has been used too I was disappointed but the price for the game is okay
Just online
English
No
El juego viene en espaol The game come in spoken spanish
The game audio is in English. There is an option to change the game text to Spanish, but I don't think it affects the audio. I would imagine if you turned on the Spanish text and enabled subtitles, you would be ok.
It's amazing you need to ask since it's clearly listed with the collector's edition listing: Exclusive 6" Kratos statue Premium steelbook case Official game soundtrack (digital version) PS3 dynamic theme PSN avatar pack Multiplayer XP Boost Unlock Pass for future DLC content
I was able to run it on Win7 Pro 64bit. Didn't require any compatibility changes or the Administrator option. Though I don't know the specs of your system, when I was playing it I had a 3.4 ghz AMD quad core, Nvidia GTX 560 Ti, and 8 gbs of 1600mhz DDR3 ram. Best answer for you: it is diffinently possible. Cheers, Matthew
You have to have internet to download and install the game and updates. The game does not come with disk or packaging, but can only be redeemed through a Steam Application code.
Yes. That is what I have and it runs just fine. A good video card is a plus.
Of Course it can
Yes
The code is to use the game on a steam account. I believe steam is free to downlaod. Got this for my son.
It certainly can. Intel UMA is really just a fancy term for saying that your graphics system uses the system RAM rather than having its own dedicated memory for graphic rendering. That said, a stand-alone graphics card with its own dedicated (faster) onboard memory will give you better results. It depends on the level of detail and performance you are hoping to achieve but purchasing a reasonably low cost graphics card +/- $100 could drastically improve your gaming experience with this and all games like it.
Yes. This game is an online code so you need steam account and steam to play it.

The shell won't but the buttons and some trimming will. The wired and wireless shells are very different. Edit: actually the faceplate of the shell may fit but I am not certain as I don't own a wired but the back plat definitely won't
Yes, it comes with everything but the electronics.
Yes they fit. Is the exact same controller except for the Home button which is different color and doesnt have the X on it.
As far as I know it only works with the X box 360 controllers but I would at least try it in your case.
I never used this software, but yes it can. I make youtube videos (Gammby5874) and I have a review of this mouse which will help you in case you don't understand this: You can make different profiles/maps for different programs. You can make one for Autocad and bind the mouse to different keystrokes. Say there is a shortcut for something that uses "P" frequently, but that is always out of the way, you can make it so that one of the mouse buttons is that letter. OR you can make it a more advanced binding. Like I said I don't use that, but this mose is WAY more than just an MMO gaming mouse. It has tons of other functionalities.
Yes for both, but the cord may not be long enough to hook up to the tower on your PC, depending on where you place your tower.
Any key even commands(crtl+s). But yeah any key!
I don't think so, sadly. I mean, you can map custom keys to the 1-12 buttons, but you can't make macros with the mouse. If you wanted, you could, say, have the "=" key on your keyboard press 1, 2, and 3 on the keyboard (You'd have to configure the macro in-game, if GW2 doesn't have macros, then you'll need a keyboard with programmable keys or a 3rd party program or something), then in Razer Synapse, you could make button 1-12 act as the "-" key, I believe.
All razor products have different warranties. Wired mice have a two year warranty as long as you have proof that you purchased it. Here is the link that gives all the information needed on razor warranties: http://www.razerzone.com/warranty On the website it says to go to www.razersupport.com to get support for the warranty if you need it. I hope this helps
I didn't installed the naga specific drivers, but the plug'n'play one works fine, and simulates a number pressing on the side buttons.
I will have to check with my son. He is the one that use that mouse. Or you can e-mail him cedricsalvador23@yahoo.com
Well the mouse itself doesn't make any noise, of course it does while moving it. But compared to my other mouses before, I'd say it's quiet, yes.
From what I can see they moved the extra 2 buttons from left of the left mouse to below the mousewheel. Only has green LEDs and you are forced to use the new Synapse drivers/app. I'm thinking of picking one of these up with discounts for $40 and then reselling to get an original or Molten for stand alone drivers.
Logitech G600 is a similar model, but I didn't used it, so I don't nothing to say about it.
Before an update that happened last month. The game had to be connect to Internet in order to play ( with a server, which you couldn't always connect to). So you needed internet and hope a server had enough room for you. Now is completely fine. And I'm not sure if when you purchase the cd for the game if it still requires an account with origin.com. If you do digital download like i did, you need to create an origin account and insert a code in order to download. So long story short, you can now play offline. Anytime, anywhere.
Yes
Yes, you can play offline now. Still plenty of bugs that will likely never be fixed but the game is playable and fun.
I would wait to see the reviews of it after it's released then compare to Simcity.
Yes. I am currently running on a Windows 8.1
They made off-line play available after the initial release. Every version should be able to play off-line now.
You will get a key.
You need one to sign in to origin. There is an offline mode though. I am not sure that he will have fun with it. I haven't played it in some time due to difficulty with new interface. Simcity 4 if you want fun.
If you downloaded it from amazon, you will need to download the origin "app" onto your computer. Once downloaded create an account with origin and register your product key with it and it will open right up
The game has been changed dramatically. Depending on what you liked in the game may lead to disappointment. With that being said, I may not have liked the game,but that was mainly because of my own expectations.you may find that the game is actually quite good. I simply want a beautified and modernized simcity 4...but others may want something different. What I will say is this, don't read the reviews, watch the videos of the game play and decide for yourself. It is true that companies can ruin games or franchises that we love, but everyone is different. I wish you luck and I really hope that you can find a.product that you.rnjoy as much as simcity for myself and command and conquer for you.

The whole series is one giant story, but the connections aren't that relevant. Each game has their own story and set of characters. There are references/cameos that you wouldn't get unless you've played the previous games, but this won't hinder your experience at all.
This is a game card
chie's va was changed and in my opinion still not great but a huge improvement,other than that there are just additions, more events, chance to improve social links at night, couple of new social links, new personas and a new dungeon, i do have to point that the difficulty at normal felt easier than in the ps2 version, and hard was, well, too hard, so if you enjoy moderate challenge keep that in mind.
Yes
Unfortunately, no.
The spoken dialogue is in English. The characters still have Japanese names such as "Yosuke Hanamura", but all the dialogue is in ENglish.
It's the English version of the game. So, yes.
As far as I know, no. There are online features such as seeing what others are doing at your area of the game and news but there are no multiplayer features.
Heavy game play with minimal but excellent crafted cut scenes
The game does have a great way of introducing you to the game mechanics. After a short time I felt like I had a good handle of the game.
Yes this one will fit all except the 3dsxl with the brackets that come along with it.
No
No. It's too narrow for the XL and will not go on it.
No, it doesn't fit the original DS. It does fit a DS lite though....hope that helps you out.
The tripple armor has extra plastic cases to protect your DS more and the blue nerf case is just the case itself without the extra armor like the triple
I don't know and I would hate to tell it could.
It looks like it will because from looking at mine, the case snaps together and the DS just lays in it.
Not sure what you mean by "regular". I bought my grandson an Nintendo 3ds for Christmas and this cover fit just fine.
We have DSi, it fits. Not sure the difference in size between DS and DSi, it does come with attachments to make it fit different DS's.
No

No
Yes it does. You have to connect to the Steam server before you can play.
Yes. The code is connected to steam so you should be able to.
I don't have Mac Devices but I think you could play this game on Mac as it shows Mac requirement on the description.
Just the first season.... you can find the 2nd season on here... believe me, its worth it... incredible!
I only did one computer, sorry I couldn't be more help
Once you get your game code you need to create a steam account. Go to https://store.steampowered.com to create your account then go to activate a product on steam and input the code and you should be all set!
AFAIK it is compatible with WIN8 and yes it has all 5 episodes of season 1. There is an other 400days episode which is not included in this package but that's not part of season 1 so it is reasonable. (400days is a standalone dlc afaik)
Are you asking what Steam is or are you wondering if I have it on Steam?

This game has Online Multiplayer 2-18. Do not see anything about Offline Multiplayer. Hope this helps you. Thank you for shopping our site, and have a wonderful day.
Hey there! Nope:) nice thing about black ops is there's no separate purchase to play online.
It can be played up to 4 Players on the same ps3 & xbox.
The only time the opponents are zombies is when you play the zombies game. It's separate from multiplayer where you play bots or people online
Only in the Xbox 360 dude
Only includes the Nuketown map. Same zombies game.
Game is very violent and graphically shows people getting shot. Very little sexual content but this is plenty of cursing
Yes
Yes, the Xbobe and play Xbox 360 ganes.
No, If you're talking about Buried Zombies, i'm pretty sure that's a DLC
Yes it will work with the Xbox wired controller. I highly recommend Titanfall. That is a great game.
Yes, although not many play multiplayer on PC
IN PC to can play with a PS3 Controller there is a program on google can fix and make u PS3 Controller useful on PC to play
Yes
no just steam pretty sure uplay is just for ubisoft games
There is two ways one u have to buy it from steam and download it or u can buy a dvd of that game and use some one elses pc to copy every file from that dvd and get ghose on a different flash drive and transfer it to u r pc.
I just use shift
No, Its a PC game for Windows Vista SP2 or Windows 7
I'm not sure how many discs are inside - its DVDrom. It does include a Steam code and an Internet connection is required to activate and play the game.
This is an H game
English sub Japanese dubbed
Yes it does.
yes, this is English subbed game that will work on window 7
yes it is...just insert disc and install as per any game
Sorry I bought this game as a gift for my brother. I asked him about it but he was not very good at explaining what it's about. He did say he liked it very much and that it works on Windows 8.
Yes it is.
No
no it does not
I just play fifa with it. Dont think it vibrates.
I assume that tried charging it for extended periods of time with no success? I can only assume that you have a faulty product, since I haven't run into that issue yet and it can play for several before needing to charge it.
The controller can turn on by itself..you only plug in the reciever
you still have to plug in the USB-drive-shape connector, then just push the "analog" button in the middle of the gamepad, it will turn on.
You need to purchase the charging packs separately.
It came with rechargeable batteries.
That it is charging my turns blue when they are done.
You need the charge pack. Not batteries.
The base itself plugs into the wall. In the controllers You can use any rechargeable battery with the normal battery pack holder that comes standard with the controller, or you can use the aftermarket tyco rechargeable battery packs which is what i use. Btw i have had this charger for over a year now and i love it. No technical problems at all. Lights red while charging then cool blue when done. Individual light for ea. controller. Very cool at nite. Hope this helped. Chance M.
It works with any xbox 360 rechargeable batteries. I got two of the 2 packs sold by amazon. The charger and the batteries work beautifully! We were spending a fortune on AA batteries.
None. It plugs into a wall. But do not charge your controllers if you are using AA battery, battery packs.
No

No
Yes, it works perfectly on a Mac. I tried it with OpenEmu which allows you to map the buttons. I only have the three button controller to test, though.
In regards to steam, it is functional if the game supports generic controllers. Many steam games when they say controller support, they only mean XBOX 360 controller support. So it really depends on the game. For instance I played rogue legacy with a sega saturn adapter and SS controller, and it worked great. The game Fez however had a number of problems regsitering other controllers than an xbox 360 one. As far as not registering, I couldn't say. I am running x64 windows 7 which in terms of driver support is usually identical, and I had no problems just plugging it in and having it detected as USB Genesis controller or something like that under devices and printers.
Yes it will. It will also work with Atari controllers
Yes
i have used mortal kombat on a genesis emulator, which is similar to street fighter. response time is fast and never laggy or unresponsive. however i used the official genesis controller, i don't know about a gamepad
I use it with Linux on a PC, but need to use a special Linux driver available at https://github.com/robmcmullen/hid-atari-retrobit otherwise only the computer only detects two directions from the joystick (down & right).
I tried mine with genuine Genesis controller and it worked fine
It makes long play sessions more comfortable, and it outlines the back touchpad for less frequent accidental hits. I purchased specifically for comfort while using for remote play (PS4). For less than $3 it is well worth it IMO.
Yes, I have the 1000 series and it fits like a glove.
I purchased this for my daughter so I'm not sure which one is a 2000 series however I do know she has the original not the slim and it fits perfect
I don't believe so, but I could be wrong.
It will no longer be a subscription based game as of March 17, 2015. It will be buy-to-play with a cash shop for cosmetic and convenience items, as well as expansions, with an optional subscription.
It's almost all PvE - the PvP is optional.
Nope it's an MMO so there is no offline mode.
I think it's just that retailers get more leeway on what to charge for boxes, whereas the digital download price is set by the manufacturer. You'll see the same thing all the time with books. The hard copy will come out for like $20 with a $15 digital download and then a few months later you can get the hard copy for $12 and the digital download is still $15. Amazon could cut the price of the book but not the digital version.
This is an MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online). You will be in the world with other real people. Sometimes, it can be a good thing or a bad thing. Most of the mechanics are the same as Skyrim. In ESO, you can do PvP (Player vs. Player), where you fight against real people and not just NPCs (or AI). You cannot do PvP in Skyrim. And, for ESO, you have to pay a subscription fee of $15/month on top of the MSRP $60 for the game to purchase. ESO is an MMO meaning it can potentially go forever, whereas Skyrim had an end!
yes
It's a number of discs for installation. But I'm not sure, at least for pc, if they're selling them with the new free to play. Haven't seen it at Wal-Mart in a month. But if they do it gives an activation code so you can play the game
Hi Nate, Yes ESO is most definitely worth trying. The community of players is very nice and friendly, so if you ever need help with something there will pretty much always be someone there to help you out. I think that once you play it for a few weeks you'll pretty much be ready to make the long term subscribe decision on your own. You need to set up subscription in order to play initially, but you get the first 30 days free regardless and you can cancel your sub before you get charged. The game, for me at least, was immensely fun and engaging for the first 2 months. Once you play through the main story line and go through each factions area, the engagement feeling drops off a bit. But at that point the game becomes less story based and almost strictly pvp based. The crafting and trade systems are wonderful and fun. My advice to any new players is to look for a trading guild the second you hit level 10. it will make your life much easier. The random encounters are fun when they happen, but i didn't see them happening too often, hopefully they will make them more frequent. tl;dr definitely try it, lots of initial fun, late game fun is an 'acquired taste'. Subscription worthy is only up to you.
This is the boxed version.
No it doesn't run through steam
It recharges like any other PS3 Controller
nope not even close and not recommended for any sort of shooter
No , also it is not working sice the first two weeks . Mother board fail
I would get a dongle and connect your ps3 or xbox 360 controller instead
Yeah it works great, if you have the lights on the battery just dies faster. Other than that I love it.
Analog sticks that are too tall. I never use it. Looks really cool, but the turbo isn't really turbo. Rather an auto-fire. Does not seem to increase speed. But I have not tried on all games.
No is just a controller is been almost a year and still works great
Yes, the turbo button toggles it.
Haven't found any,played almost 30 games with it so far.
Yes but it isn't great and there is no indication when it is on. I wouldn't buy it for the rapid fire option.
You will receive the actual mouse, the Driver Update means for people who have bought it there is an addition driver update from the one on the disk, on there website. You will receive the mouse, a cd, and a manual. You can then go to there website to download the updated drivers.
By tilt, you mean two additional click types by moving the mouse wheel to the left or right? No, The mousewheel doesn't have that functionality. Just center click, and the scroll.
I have had the mouse for over a year. i throw it around, keep it in my back pack under textbooks knocking around quit a bit. this mouse is sturdy as can be, as light of as heavy as you want because you can change the weight, and is great for gaming or just web browsing. it was built to last and will do just that. not to mention you can change the led colors!
I bought one for a mac, and it seemed to work fine when I was just using regular applications (the DPI settings are changeable as they are built into the mouse) and I got all of the non-primary buttons to work using USBOverdrive (you can assign any button to do anything). Now if you are actually gonna use it for games on your mac, don't get it. Whenever I started a game (any game with the exception of Minecraft) with the mouse plugged in, my mac froze unless I was in bootcamp (windows 7). I had to send it back, and the Perixx customer support said they will be releasing drivers for OSX soon and to rebuy it when that happens.
No, not to my knowledge. I purchased this mouse on behalf of a friend. I also researched youtube.com for reviews. My current mouse is "Logitech Wireless Performance Mouse MX". it has free-scrolling.
Net weight 5.00 oz. with weight it is 6.03 oz
Yes, it should work fine. You can also download the software from the manufacturers website.
Yes, just behind the scroll wheel is a spring slider for you to turn up or down the DPI. I personally leave the DPI alone at about half of its max. You can also configure the buttons to have a sniper zoom function like for world of tanks I have the left thumb button set up for me to quickly toggle into and out of sniper mode. The buttons can also be changed to have a simple toggle set to change between 2 DPI settings if the DPI button is insufficient.
The software is really nice and allows a lot of flexibility. You can assign CTRL and ALT however the FN is not map-able, at least not with my tests.
My Alienware has a cd drive but the mouse comes with one of those little cds...I went to google and searched for Perixx MX-2000IIB software and found it and downloaded it and it works perfect.
It works but I went from PC Hoyle to Mac and do not like it and they have removed a lot of games.
Black Jack, Bridge, Canasta, Crazy Eights, Cribbage, Euchre, Gin, Go Fish, Hearts, Memory Match, Miami Solitaire, Old Maid, Pinocle, Pitch, Poker, Rummy 500, Skat, Solitare, Space Race, Spade, Spite and Malice, Space Race, Tarot, Tuxedo, Video Blackjack, Video Poker, Video Texas Hold'em and War
Lots, including Spades, Bridge, Hearts, Spite, GoFish, and about 20 types of Solotaire, plus many others
Yes it does. I have problems getting it to load. When I click on the regular icon it just wants to install the program over and over. I have to go into Finder and Applications to find the right icon to get the games started. (Maybe that is my ignorance?) Once I have it loaded, the games play with no problem.
I have an iMac and a Macbook and had to buy a game for each computer. In both cases I did not have a disc. I downloaded the game from Amazon. I imagine the game is too old to be able to find it on disc....and even then, I don't know if a single disc cold provide the game for multiplr computers. It is a good game, Chuck
I don't have Maverick...works well with OSX

No it does not it's exclusively for xbox 360
USB CABLE
It's not a model plane... it's a plane unlock in the game. Don't waste your money on this game... it's really not that good. The stick is not too bad yet not the best I've used. If you find really cheap then might be worth it.
The buttons will work as a controller, but you may have to reconfigure other games button assignments if they do not match Damage Inc.
yes I have all those games and it works with them all and more and buy the way good choice of games man!!gamer omac1962.
No, it has a wire. It's long about 8-15 feet though.
Yes it can.
Yes
I THINK I REMEMBER that there is a stick you can order for the PC for 59.99 or .95 something like that so I don't know if this one will work or not. I know it works on my 360 and not on ps3 or 4s.
They're set to 1-0, -, and =. the g-shift key makes them act as ctrl+those same buttons. The mouse's on board memory also allows these buttons to be changed via the software on one system, but the mouse itself will remember the changes so that you may plug and play on another system with your changed button layout.
For the most part it is not textured. It has a sort of matte paint feel, kind of like gamepads (xbox 360, ps3). On the right side of the mouse it is textured with a rubber material to help you keep your grip.
They are prgramable with the ability to do more then one button at a time so you could program Ctrl+c to copy as a button. Only problem I had was making the shift key function as a programble button such as Ctrl but you can program the shift functions and it works with shift key then.
All of the buttons are amazingly responsive. The only issue I have with the mouse is that there's no place to rest your thumb other than a button, so when you "white-knuckle" the mouse during combat, you may unintentionally hit a thumb button. The thumb buttons are angled so you can easily identify without looking down which button your thumb is resting on. The Naga Razor doesn't have this feature. All the buttons on the Naga are flush, so you have to look to see where your thumb is.
You can, but it's probably going to be a bit less effective than a grip that doesn't rely heavily on the thumb for movement. I have no idea how I played MMOs before this mouse. It even has massive utility for the FPS games I play. I would change my grip style to use it & never look back. :)
Well the one on the top is to mode switch and the one that is raised up is an extra button. the mouse is awesome trust me.
As far as I have been able to find out with light research, Logitech is probably trying to get more money for the same product just different color and call it a special. I doubt the cost is actually increased or any real reason beyond that. I personally wouldn't want a white mouse though, simply because black hides dirt and grime better. But a white mouse would probably prompt more frequent cleanings.
Yes
yes
Yes it works fine in Mac Os, but you need to download the drivers from logitech page: http://www.logitech.com/support/g600-mmo-gaming-mouse
Yes. I use it along with a G13 for AutoCAD at work. Having enter, esc, del, bksp, undo, redo, & other commands always available is a great addition. Honestly, I game at home, but I make better use of the G buttons with productivity software than I ever have in the games (not that I don't use them for those too). For repetitive, command intensive software, programmable keys are the way to go.
Measuring the bottom it's 4x3. It doesn't seem much larger than the average mouse but it's higher. The side buttons are very small. I have medium size female hands and it's about perfect for me. Also it is very sensitive and for the top regular right/left click buttons you can press really far back on them and still have them work so it should be fine.
If you have a G600 producted prior to Oct 2012 you will not be able to update the firmware on the mouse. You will be stuck with firmware 77.00.12. If you call Customer support, and have some time, they should be able to offer you a resolution. I battled with the spazzing and skipping of the mouse sicne I got i. I thought maybe it was my mouse pad, so I got a new mouse pad after cleanign the lens of the mouse. Still it continued. After i built a new rig, the sam e problem continuied to occur. I was able to finally find out that it was due to me being an early adopter for the mouse and that I would need to get a new produced mouse so I can perform updates.
Every single button can be reprogrammed aside from the dpi and mode switch buttons.
I thought it would at first but it never has
It helps. Being able to switch weapons in a bind and using the g shift button to temporarily lower the sensitivity when sniping and instantly go back to normal sensitivity is nice. This is the best mouse I've ever used. Feels great works great and will last for a long time.
No, they are well enough apart that they are easily pushed separately but it does take time to get used to it.
Yes it is. Just tested it now :D
claw grip is problematic because it becomes too easy to press a thumb key. they really need a raised fix ridge or ridges running between rows of keys so you can grip something with your thumb without also pressing a key Personally using this and the razer naga has caused a RSI with my thumb specifically because of having to lock it in a weird position to just to keep from pressing a thumb key
I'm not sure; I bought this mouse for a Windows PC. It works great for Windows PC though.
That depends on your gaming system. You might have to ask Nintendo. I thought all gaming systems were the same not like DVD players.
I don't know. I do know that Just dance 4 has a copyright year if 2012 printed on the disc. It could still be what your wisher wants. I'm sorry I can't be more help
Just Dance 2015 was for our grandkids at Christmas. I did get a chance to do some of the video with the kids then. 2015 has a lot more of the newer songs and has a lot of new dance moves. With the three granddaughters it is important they keep up with all the latest moves. I am having a lot of fun learning with them. I am in a jazzercise class so these videos are a great help. Hope that helps you. Pinky
I don't know. You might want to contact Nintendo and ask if the U.S. programs are compatible with Europe.
The short answer is yes. We already had two controllers for both my boys. But if you really want to, uh, Just Dance... you can just stand behind the kids with remotes and dance along with them! My wife and I you got just as much benefit... And it's just as fun. True, you just don't get to keep track of your score or how perfect you matched the moves.
You can have up to 4 girls dancing at one time. Yes you need a remote for each of them if you want to record their score and see who wins. If they just want to dance for fun then they can all dance by just following the person on screen. Either ways are fun. Hope I answered your question! Happy dancing!
It require the Wii remote controller does not need a mat. Just a good set of space to move.
I'm not sure if DDR & Just Dance are compatible. So I can't say for sure.
A nintendo wii, it is a video game so you need a console
Yes. It also depends on how you go about the missions
You can play Stealth or go in guns a blazing throughout most of the game, but there are a few stages that must be performed in the stealth mode, just a few. (I love the guns a blazing)
No.
Yes it does have Spanish language and is not that bad actually
No
Hello, good morning. As I have understood the game is not compatible with the PS Move, if so it would indicate in the box the game; like playing Killzone 3 I hope it's helpful. good day
Not really no, deus ex is a first person role playing game while splinter cell blacklist is an action adventure stealth game. But there are first person shooter type elements in the game with a certain character that you play with in certain missions.
S

From what I've seen it doesn't have Spanish subtitles. Perhaps in a future update Spanish subtitles will be provided in the game. Your best bet is to enable Spanish from the PS3 crossbar menu.
I have never used it from a full charge down to zero battery, but I have used it for probably about 4 hours without it dying or even a reduction in volume.
http://youtu.be/PEd5iQlwimc, this shows how to set it up.
I think there's something wrong with that one you received. I think you should send it back.
Just charging cant plug it in check your settings on you ps3
It did not connect with my PS3
I really don't think so since the headset and speakers are usually accesories that will pair with something else eg to a pc a console a car a phone etc, don't think these accesories will pair to one another then again i could be wrong safest bet would be using them both through a laptop.
Same here!! I never figured it out. Other folks were able to get it up and running but I was never able to. So sorry I can't be of any help.
It's Bluetooth. So, yeah.
It'll work for any bluetooth device it is an universal headset it even works with my car haha
yes
Hi there, I haven't yet installed the the game on my PC as I first need to activate a 'Steam Account' which is a pre requisite apparently. The advice given on the back of the case re video card (presumably one in the same a grahphics card) is: Directx compatible or later with 512MB RAM AMD: ADA RADEON2600XT, 3650 5550, 6450 or higher per series NVIDIA GFORCE8600GT,9500GTGT150, GT1250
Yes they do, and perfectly I must say! Just plug in the usb dongle into ps4 usb port and turn headphones on and your done, no setting it all up, microphone also picks up really good so people have no problem hearing you talking. There is also an app for ps4 called headset companion app and in that you can choose different sound modes and update the headset as needed. Even if these are more get these over the new PlayStation headphones the new ones are horrible, no bass! And with these elites you can actually plug anything with a headphone jack into the dongle and it will send the audio wirelessly to the headphones, I use them with my cell phone, tv, Xbox one and ps4 wirelessly. And you can also use them like a regular set of headphones with the cable if you need them but forgot to charge them.
It does come with a 3.5mm jack, which you can connect to the PS4 controller and still hear the audio and chat. The only downside to that is that the features won't work, like the awsome bass.
Pulse Elite&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Gold.
headphones work fabulous on ps4
Most everything works on the PS4. The volume controls are a bit wonky but you'll get used to them in time. The software side doesn't work to lower chat volume and there is no "your voice through speakers" feature like Turtle Beach has. If you play a lot of multiplayer like I do, you'll find a sweet spot and leave it there. As for being comfy? They are quiet comfortable. Of course if you wear glasses you'll eventually get the geek headache from it squeezing them into your domepiece. Otherwise if you wear them without a hat or glasses on, they are comfortable. I've owned headsets from every brand on the market. Turtle Beach is alright but they break easily. Astro is by far too expensive and the company attitude/customer service is vomit worthy. Tritton is just... sad. Logitech and Corsair are awesome but console compatibility is an issue. This headset is actually well built and my favorite I've owned. It has some quirks but it makes up for it in ease of setup. Other headsets require a ton of unsightly cabling.
They arent true 7.1... It states virtual 7.1 stereo sound.
If it's honesty you want then there's only one choice The Pulse Elite i have two sets now my Daughter and myself best headset I owned todate, so good my Daughter had me get a set for her. Too many options to list what can be done with them but you will be very pleased. One set is over a year old the other close to a year now..Have not had ANY PROBLEMS AT ALL... And we both game alot WOW, Neverwinter,Diablo3 also Sniper and star craft all work great no flaws at all. So there it is now it's up to you? and those are only a few games I've tried with them good luck..
Yes you can. It has 3 settings Off, Low, High. I will say though on High it's still "low" and you can slightly hear your own voice. Not the best but the sound quality of the headphones makes up for the sidetone quality for me.
To be honest, I haven't used the gold headset and i havent been able to test the unobstructed range seeing as how I live in a small house. I do know for a fact that the gold has a better range and battery life seeing as how it's newer. BUUUT in MY opinion, the pulse elites are better because you can make anything with an aux out port wireless. They feel amazing. I had them charging and did a 24 hour game session and i had absolutely no discomfort (as far as the headset goes that is. They will reach through your average wall. I was listening to music from my ps3 in my bathroom that is about 15-20 feet away with to walls. Now I can't say for sure if you will get that kind of reach through the walls at your house or not but that isn't a really big deal. All around I would pick these over the gold anytime. Now don't get me wrong, they're both AMAZING headsets!!
Yes, you can. It has sidetone. You have to hold the mute button down for two seconds to switch between low and high sidetone. The sidetone on high sounds very low though.
No. The headset fits snugly on the head. They're not too tight though.
I don't have the packaging anymore but from looking at the images, it's showing English at very top of each feature and then showing other languages in smaller type underneath. So I think it should be alright. Although to add to this, my microphone part was no longer recognized by Windows even though the headphones still work great.
With the open foam ear cups, you have very good ambient awareness. Sound quality is very good, although sensitivity is a little low if you try to use these for mobile device.
No.
The Sennheiser PC 310 Gaming Headset has a 3.5mm stereo (a.k.a. 1/8" or "mini") plug and a same size microphone jack/plug...so if that is what size your ps4 requires then this will work. These size plugs are very commom form factor used in many electronics, smartphones, mp3 players, tablet/laptops, clock radios etc
The box says 2 years, but I don't know exactly what sort of problems this warranty covers.
Mic works really well.
Stereo
This works very well, in Skype. The mic is good, and the noise-cancelling doesn't seem to cause any discernible lag, according to those I've asked, since I got this. I don't seem to hear any of those pregnant pauses that seem to plague my cell phone.
They are on ear, not bad for sound isolation though.
It is a USB headset with 3.5mm connectors for audio and mic.
I own both headsets and they both use the same technology for the Microphone. I use it to record audio and if I had to choose between the two I would pick the 360 by very close margin. hope this helps. But honestly, you cant go wrong with either headset.
They are considered open ear headphones -- cloth ear cuffs.
Sturdy and comfortable, you can wear them for hours and they never get uncomfortable. But certainly sturdy and durable.
I think they feel like you would expect them to. it's not hollow plastic, so it feels denser, but it is very plasticky. People around you cannot hear what you are listening to. They are "open" in the sense that they aren't noise cancelling as much as one with leather or faux leather are, but they don't allow the speakers to be heard much even if the headset is around your neck.
They do not require an amplifier. And they also include a USB sound device which powers them such that you will actually need to turn down the analog volume control on the headset to listen at a comfortable level. When the integrated volume control is at full, you should probably set your regular sound card to 20% or so. Or set your sound device to full and turn down the headset.
Hardware wise they are the same. Looks and Audio presets are slightly different.
Yes, you can use Bluetooth or a cocorthst come with
Kim, Joshua has the best advice and have your son or you follow his instructions. If all fails contact Amazon and let them know the problem and you can get an replacement right away!
The Transmitter uses a DC 5v input for power. The USB is used to recharge the battery in the headset, and it is the only way to recharge it that I am aware of. Can you explain your concerns regarding the USB recharging cable?
I don't know what type of adapter you would need. The Xbox One has digital audio out (optical) that will plug directly into the base station of this headphone setup.
I don't see why not. It has analog (yellow RCA) plug and digital (optical) plug. I have the TV optical passing thru to the stereo so anything plugged into my TV (DVR, XBOX, DVD) plays thru the headphones without the stereo on.
Yes you will need a Bluetooth adapter for your PC.
yes it should work! i use mine with xbox one but without the adapter.
No
Yes, unfortunately the E does not have an optical port, so we made a special adapter to use our digital surround sound headsets with the Xbox 360 E. You can only purchase it at our website ... http://www.turtlebeach.com/product-detail/audio-converter-parts/ear-force-hd-audio-converter/421

I don't remember seeing anything about a warranty in the box, but I have used mine almost everyday since I bought it and not once have I had any issues with it. Turtle Beach makes really good products, I have three of there headsets and not one has had any issues. I would just register it through the website and if you have any problems contact them about it, I have heard really good things about there customer support.
Not 100% sure but they are dual band so its possible it would work.
The wireless transmitter will pass through digital optical -- it has both an in and out port for optical -- so you should be able to daisy-chain, plugging the transmitter into the PS3, and the DAC into the transmitter.
Yes, but you need the Xbox One chat adapter.
No. This is a gaming headset.. It's engineered only for games. The sound quality and its chat quality in playstation and Xbox is unbeatable but don't expect it to give you the same results via any other media source
No, I would not recommend these particular TB's...
no sorry
Yes, works in mine just fine
Yes
Don't know I had bad experience with them

Not really, you just follow the dancers on the TV and try to do the same movements as they do; then it gives you a score.
i purchased this for my 6 year old and 9 year old grand daughters and they love it
I don't know
Yes it will. All Wii games work with Wii U. We have this and 23 other wii games and use them all on Wii U
Just the remotes, no dance pad needed.

Depends on which game you are playing. No sexual nudity to my knowledge, there is a cut scene (RED6) of a character hatching from an egg and there is a full frontal of a woman. It is quite graffic...so if you are on the fence you might want hold off. Overall I loved the game, but I can understand/respect wanting to make sure.
No they don't expire. If I was able to send you a picture I would of the directions. Buy mine for $60. I think it's cheaper and all the codes are there. I don't have xbox live.
This edition has both physical discs and download codes. Resident Evil 6, Resident Evil 6 Language Pack and Resident Evil Degeneration are physical discs. Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil Code Veronica X and Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition are download codes.
In fact, No, so go ahead with it...
No they were not remastered. You just receive a download code for the game on PSN
The Download codes come with the game. Which you download from either Xbox Live or PSN. If you already own Resident Evil 1 through 5 from either of the networks, avoid this game. As the game comes with codes to download the games from either of the online services
Yes....
The one i got was only 6 didnt have any other game with it
Most of the time if the game was from another country it will state it. Wen i bought mine i just made sure it was from a state in the USA. I wanted the BIO-Hazzard Resident evil but it was only produced in Japan. Most sellers put what region...I looked at the game you are interested in and it looks like it would play in US only. Sorry i wasn't much help.
It's just 1 disc. Games 1 through 5 are downloadable content only, from the online Playstation store.
I've never played the Game Cube versions but I've played the original PlayStation versions and that's exactly what it looks like.
As far as I know ps4 is not backwards compatible at all. Thats why is you bought call of duty or battle feild 4 you could by it for ps4 for 10 dollars. Either way by it new your getting like 6 games it's worth it if you have a ps3
You need to give them your console , or tell them to add on an external hdd then transfer it to your console , and it has to be downloaded from your PSN account so you can play it
Yes it will.
Yes it will work. That's what kind my Husband has and it works perfectly :-)
Yes. It is 3D. But this is a classic side-scroller, so the 3D doesn't make much of an impact. Still plenty of fun though. One of my kid's favorites.
I use the 3ds only for which this game was designed. My guess is it will not.
The Most Newest Game with Mario for 3DS is Yoshi's New Island-based on the Super Nintendo Game Yoshi's Island.
No
I believe 3ds games have a bump in the cartridge that makes them incompatible with dsi or other previous generation handhelds, so no.
I checked my game and it doesn't indicate being able to choose languages. I would suggest you contact Nintendo as their "Help" info is very good and they do respond rather quickly to customer questions.
Yes
The game I bought didn't work in my console (2DS). I bought that one in Spain, I think it shouldn't be an American Console
Yes it will.
Yes it will work. That's what kind my Husband has and it works perfectly :-)
Yes. It is 3D. But this is a classic side-scroller, so the 3D doesn't make much of an impact. Still plenty of fun though. One of my kid's favorites.
I use the 3ds only for which this game was designed. My guess is it will not.
The Most Newest Game with Mario for 3DS is Yoshi's New Island-based on the Super Nintendo Game Yoshi's Island.
No
I believe 3ds games have a bump in the cartridge that makes them incompatible with dsi or other previous generation handhelds, so no.
I checked my game and it doesn't indicate being able to choose languages. I would suggest you contact Nintendo as their "Help" info is very good and they do respond rather quickly to customer questions.
Yes

You can use old skylanders on new portals but not always vis ver sa.
They are regular size. Not as big as Tree Rex
No, you would need the nun chuck with the wiimote.
No, it will not work with the ds but will work with the wii U. You have to buy the 3ds starter kit to get the right portal the good news they are completly different games and you get pop fiz with 3ds and of course you can use all the figures on both games.
The actual figure will work on any platform, but the game needs to be specific to you machine. So you would need to buy the starter pack for an Xbox 360.
Yes
Yes
This should work on the wii system with no problem. My grandson has the Skylanders & the Skylanders Giant.
No....the Skylanders swap force figures do not work on the portal of the Skylander Giants game.
Yes you can use any of the Skylanders on the portal.

According to the information from Ubisoft on Amazon, it does. If you're purchasing it used, I'd ask. I can understand thinking it wouldn't at that price, but the info says it does.
No.
Yes
No. PS4 cannot play PS3 discs. However, a limited number of PS3 titles are available on PS4 via the PlayStation Now service.
Out of the box, this game is solely focused on guitar. You must purchase a digital add on for bass guitar. At the time I purchased the add on it was USD $9.99. That said, the bass feature works great and is a ton of fun. Just be aware that this feature costs extra.
The game reads like tablature, not musical notes and therefore is unfortunately guitar and bass specific.
It must state it on box. Mine did.
Yeah, it has both guitar and bass options.
Yes, with two cords, two people can play.
If this question has come to me because it's the same one I purchased, rest easy, it will include the cable. Get ready to rock!
Hey man, I was Worried bout the same thing, happy to say that it does. You can't use the windows drivers or whatevs, but it shows up in the dolphin controller set up, and you just have to manually set it up, which is easy
No
It does work with Windows 8 and 8.1.
Yes, I have mine hooked up to a wavebird now :) I can't speak to other wireless models however. But I would imagine they would work the same.
I play project m on it all of the time. You have to play with the configurations on it to emulate a true gc controller. It may not be 1 to 1 accuracy but I think it works well enough for practice if its your only option. Playing on a gamecube or wii would be better if you have it.
if it has controller support it should. use joy2key if not.
No
No it doesn't
It's plug and play, I didn't have to do anything other than just plug it into a USB port. Dolphin emulator recognized it right away
It's read as a generic input, so any emulator allowing button mapping (which should be all of them) should be compatible.. I used it specifically with dolphin, but should work elsewhere. I don't support emulation, and the only games I emulate are isos I rip off my own discs to play over the Internet Internet with friends.

As far as I know, the xbox 360 needs to be wired
No, this device is only for use with controllers, however it will enable you to use a ps2, ps3, or xbox 360 controller on a PC if you want to. If you check on http://mayflash.com/Products/XBOXXBOX360/MF001.html you can see a diagram about what this adapter will enable you to do, as well as further details. If you are looking for a device to use a mouse and KB with an Xbox 360, you won't find one cheap. I have never seen one for under $40. Mayflash also makes one, called the Max Shooter for Xbox 360, and it's the cheapest I've seen.
yes, well done, thank you so much !!!
This is not meant for use with the PS4.
I don't think it would work. I just tried to get the process started (you need an original wired xbox controller to start) and it didn't work. so more than likely you won't be able to do this, however....google controller max! this might be able to help you or look up chronus max on amazon.
U prob is conflict between nvidia chipset and you madcazt stick, but this adapter is fine to solve you problem, or any pci usb2-3 card..
Once you use the controller the sysgem recognizes the ps3 as that controller and u cant cinnect it again
no I believe the original xbox controller had a round plug similar to gamecube. there may be an additional adapter to convert to usb but the product in question only has a usb port and a ps2 controller port
I'm pretty sure this adapter only supports one controller at a time.
Nop there is no way u can use with wiiu pro on a ps3
It is the best one
According to Google the expiration date is never really set in stone. MW3 has regular updates so I would just enter it and you will most likely be good to go. I am sure the Playstation Network would make it right they are great at customer service.
Yo lo compre y me vino en inlges, nunca he conseguido ese juego en espaol he botado mi dinero tratando de encontrar uno en espaol
Negative, everything is in English and not even give you another choice. What's more if you want to sell it is in perfect condition like new. I remain attentive to your comments.
Andrew, it is exactly the same disc as the normal mw3 except it just has the code to enter to get the dlc. If you have the game already, I suggest you don't buy this because you'll be paying and getting the game again but it's your choice.
Holla
Google it :/
From what I remember its only green.
So far as I know, you're talking about two different things. "8200dpi" is the mouse's resolution, and the 4G Dual Sensor System (a laser and an optical sensor, not two lasers) is the sensor package used to achieve that resolution. http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-mice/razer-taipan
Yes they can! All four buttons on both sidesign can be individually reprogrammed to an extent. But in my case, many of the button are not fully reliable. I find myself not clicking as forcefully as I should, thus resulting in the key not registering the action. So no half assed cliclicking!
only one optic lazer
i don't use a claw grip and i feel fine with it. I have the Bf4 version of this, so the top is sort of slippery, but the regular taipan has rubber over the center so it clings well to your hand.
yes it does. But if you use Razer Synapse you can control the amount of acceleration from 0 to 10.
Hey mate, I'm Razer's super fan. I got every type of Razer mouse. Taipan is a good mouse, nice responds and comfortable weight. Just a little bigger than Orochi. But for performance, Taipan is better. I strongly recommend this mouse. If you want a smaller one, Orochi will be a good choice.
yes it can, anywhere between 100-8200 DPI in increments of 100
It's a very flat mouse. Low profile and long.
No
Sorry. It's is matching same tiles.
Yes, no problems.
I found out that I have Windows 7 and it work for me. So it should work for Windows 8.1
All of the games listed are the complete version with no additional cost. You just choose from the list which ones you want to put on to your computer. They have their first versions of the game (not as good) up to the latest (very good). I have had more fun with that one purchase. It's a GREAT deal!
Good day, I have not personally used but I understand that if it works, I recommend the brand to see what map is on PS3
Yes, I've been playing with the G27 and had no problems.
Yes, this is the English US version...

If you buy the game new, the voucher is still good until 2016. However, if you buy it used, the voucher may not be included or already used so it can't be used again.
Yeah but it's free so don't worry about it
No, none of the God of war titles in this collection are multiplayer only God of war ascension.
English
Hi Alfonso, God of War I & II are Disc One, God of War III is Disc Two. God of War Collection (Chain of Olympus and Ghost of Sparta) are downloadable items.
They're good for ps3 as well.
Maybe try again and check your spelling... All of mine worked
Unless you have a PSN account from USA or Canada then the code will not work.
No you'll have to you psn for chains of Olympus and ghost of apart but be carful those two games are like dlc full games but some cases they have already been used so basically you might only get 3 games GOD 1,2,3
No
I ordered the game on Aug. 28th 2014 even though I read a lot of comments mentioning that the dlc voucher is no longer valid (still thought two games for 20 bucks is a good deal even without all the extra stuff). So it was a nice surprise that I was still able to download all the dlc - the "super voucher" that came with it stated "valid 06/15/2014 - 06/17/2017", so maybe now they're shipping out updated vouchers or something.
Yes but the download codes will not work in other countries.
Plastic
Yes it is
My copy came with everything. And the codes got me another copy of second game and trial of first... dont know if that is how its supposed to be
Hi Don, I'm afraid the DLC vouchers have already been used.
Yes they are.
Plastic case
No but it would be pretty cool
2 discs (one game on each) and a third game as download content. 3rd game alone is worth the price of the collection in my opinion.
Only partially. As shown in the picture, the programmable macro keys are backlit. It's also got a backlit volume wheel.
http://www.aziocorp.com/en/content/11-warranty
Yes, It comes with software to change the macros.
Yes
Good firm plastic
Key caps are nice. Not silky like a K 70 but not super rough. My wasd keys are only slightly faded after 1.5 years or so
I'm not positive but I have mine running from under my desk and through the back of desk and I can sit it in my lap and recline in my big mens chair is say about six feet but I don't have a tape measure
Correct. If you want something to happen u have to assign it at the azio app
I do not see any compatibility options for MAC OS online. As a USB 2.0 connection, they are compatible to a certain extent, but are NOT 100% compatible with each other considering the "WIN" function that has programmable keys available with Windows software.
2" between those key

it works on Windows 8.0 but haven't tried with 8.1. I assume it should work with 8.1 as well.
Correct answer is no. The game requires the program Origin in order to run. If you don't have access to the internet, Origin and this FIFA cannot run. You can disconnect the internet after the program is started though.

Nope it's worked fine
It should work with every xbox 360. I have the newer version. (the slim black with built in wifi) I'm not entirely sure which model is the "pro". The adapter to plug in to the console is the standard component port.
The one I bought hasn't done that to me yet. It seems like a pretty quality product.
Hello. It is Japanese only
No, the console version doesn't contain any H scenes and a censored "gore" scene.
Yes you can. There is no problem to use this game on an American ps3.

Yeah, buddy. Picked up Titanfall and had gotten it the week before for that purpose. Looking forward to being able to play Battlfield 4.
Yes it works perfectly and has not shown any signs of malfunction..
You should not need cables at all. First, you will need to identify the type of xbox you have. If you have a "fat" (curved sides, no vent on side), you purchased the wrong hard drive. If your Xbox is "slim", (angled or straight sides, vent on the side) then you will need to remove the small vent on the side of the Xbox and slide the drive in.
I haven't had that issue, i installed 6 games between new and old games to the HDD and it's working fine. so far so good
Sure does. It will ask him when he first starts the game(any game) where he wants to save the data to.
I'm using it for BF4 with no problems. Not sure about Watch Dogs, but it works with all my titles, even GTA V (which requires a hard drive for content installation). Pretty sure you'd have no problems, but if you did you can always use a USB stick alongside it or by itself.
The way im thinking is doing it by clonning software on a pc.
By "regular xbox 360" do you mean the original XBox? This drive is only for the newer 360 S (Slim). This page explains the different storage options depending on the type of XBox you have: http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/storage
yes it will work fine
You need the 500gb slim version or you can take apart the regular 500gb one (if you have the right screwdriver). The 320gb and 500gb both work well, it just depends on how much space you need.
Yes. Just watch for disclaimers stating otherwise. All that aside, you buy new, it comes with one. Happy spending!
You can turn off the WiFi connectivity if that's what you mean. There's a button on the side.
Yeah, but for a year or two so I strongly suggest to get an warranty (Canpoy or Sqauretrade, if offered) so you'll know you're covered in case it gets damaged or spill on.
Believe me, it will make most of your dreams come true. It's that great.
Yes you can. Although you cannot play GBA games, and so with DS games that sometimes have the feature to connect to a GBA game and get goodies, like Harvest Moon DS or Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, you won't be able to do so. Otherwise, you can play the games just fine.
The U.S
Yes
none. its the system only.
Sure my grandson is only 7 years old and we buy used games all the time. You can play any type of D's game on this machine.
Hello there. The one we have for sale originally came with 4.5 however we may own different releases. Check this site to match your serial number and you may be able to find out which yours came with. http://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/3DS_hacking_faq#Can_you_check_the_System_version_before_buying_a_new_3DS.3F
Mine came with a firmware of 6.2 and I received it on January 10, 2015
Netflix is also available on the 3DS.
Hi there Torey W! Unfortuneately, the 3DS series is completely regionlocked (3DS/i/XL/[2DS]). There are, I believe, three regions - Europe-Australia / Canada-America / Asia. If you buy a 3DS in America, it can only play games from America. If you are interested in buying a Japanese version of the 3DSXL, you'll need to look into buying a 3DSLL, which is the name of the system in Japan. It'll be expensive, but there are so, SO many more colors and combinations that you can buy. That said, it is still possible to interact with people who have different region-locks. Even though my 3DS is American, I can still interact with Japanese and European 3DS' in all ways. I hope this helps!!
In my experience as far as power goes they're the same. I've played both from fully charged to no power at all. Neither one is better or worse than the other when comparing power!
English
I'm not sure I understand you correctly, so, I'll just say that I received my 3DS XL in April of this year(2014).
I would recommend the Sony MDR-222KD Children's Headphones
Yes
Yes. It is the exact same product from Nintendo as the ones seen in store. Just be sure you are getting the color you want, which will be labeled in the description. The color scheme (ex. red/black) means the lid or top of the DS is red and the bottom portion is black. The lower portion on all 3DS XL's are black unless it is a special edition which it would specify. Hope this answer helps. I love my 3DS XL. Worth the purchase.
En el menu primo escoja Configuracion de la consola/ entonce Otras opciones/ #4, el primero opcion es Idioma/ escoja la tercera linea- Espanol. From the main menu select System Settings/ Other Settings/ #4- Language/ the third line is Spanish.
Yes it should. I don't believe there's been a change in screen size, and this article says so too. http://www.kotaku.com.au/2014/12/nintendo-new-3ds-xl-australian-review/
According to Nintendo the Screen Sizes are exactly the same so you should be fine! http://www.nintendo.com/3ds/features/compare#/compare-3ds
No it doesn't affect the 3D.its hardly noticeable that the protector is even on the system at all. Best protector pack you can buy.
Nope, it doesn't do anything for glare. It has no effect on the screen.
Yes
No , Two filters one for the top screen and one for the bottom .
There are instructions inside that tell you how to apply it without putting your fingers on the backs of the adhesive. Each tab is numbered in an order to apply it. I am sure there are videos on youtube you can consult. Hope this helps.
Enough for 1 3DS XL.
Yes it will, I have it on my 3ds xl and it fits perfectly
He means is the screen protector sandwiched between two disposable layers typically labeled A and B like on mobile phone screen protectors. They're simply for application and you peel them off in steps (sometimes labled as 1 and 2 instead). I don't know the answer, but wanted to help him.
It's real product package and We will ship out. you need to activate the code through internet and steam account. There might be update for the game.
It's steam game. I am playing the game and enjoy it also. price is depend on platform and seller.
It should do. I've had my steam account since I lived in the UK and I've since installed over 100 U.S games without issue, so you shouldn't have any problems.
What? Just hit escape and save the game? Then hit exit? I haven't played in a while, so I can't quite remember, but this seems most logical to me.
Nope. It's a game with 2 CDs to run on PC under steam and not a game code. I hope it helps and good luck with this awesome game!!!

No
Not required, but it would make it better. We use the regular remote control and it works fine.
No, it does not. It is single player only. But my kid and I go back and forth until one of us gets 3 stars.

No this not a multiplayer game
I believe it's just single player
No it is not.
I'm not sure where to find if it is or is not. I looked over case, instructions and disc. If you can help me with that, I would be glad to help you.

It is possible. The solution is like mild soapy water and if the autographs are not in some sort of permanent pen like a sharpie.
Yes it works
I've used Skinomi on other things before and it never damaged anything. I'm ready to remove it from my 3DS. I was happy with the top and bottom
I think so
There is a version on Amazon made for n3DSXL by skinomi.
Ntsc version only and not listed as region free compatible.
No multiplayer whatsoever. This means no online, no local, no splitscreen..
No, it was cut during development. The game is single-player only although it does have multiplayer type modes besides the campaign but you play against the computer.
No
they are good but .seem to go wrong easly got them replaced after breaking free of charge but now gone wrong again.
It comes with everything you need. Just follow the instructions booklet inside. It's real simple.
No just Xbox 360
It works perfectly with PC, I have no idea why they don't specify
In my opinion. No. I've had to get the actual headset replaced four times, and bought multiple parts. This is a huge hassle and customer service was very bad.
Yes is has a low buzz when sound is absent. Not noticeable during game play though. Personally doesn't bother me.
Yes it does. You have to install the piece that you talk into. When I did that, everyone in the game complained I was drowning out everything with a buzzing to THEM, I only heard a slight buzz. Don't buy it. Go for Turtlebeach, learn from my hardship.
Yes it is not a wireless headset.
Yes , but you need to purchase controller adapter for chat.
The mic is decent however unreliable, the headset is not great quality. I've had two randomly stop working. On materials being poor quality. Invest in Astro's.

Yes
I've used it a bit to try it out. My copy of Halo: CE (the first one) responds to it (although there's less buttons than on the XBox Controller) so I suppose it's possible it would work for other games.
No. The slot is there, but only for aesthetic purposes.
Very authentic. Though I will say the first time you play it it can feel a bit stiff. But pay with it a little bit and it will start to loosen up
If you're asking if it works with the retro system itself, it does not. Works for computer emulators. However, if you're asking if it works on a Nintendo emulator, it does. I use this controller for gameboy, NES, super nintendo and N64. You just map out the buttons in the controller input setting and map the buttons to whatever feels comfortable for you
it is a bit different. It's more like the Gamecube stick
It's not really worth it for the authentic feel. I would recommend a N64 usbadapter instead and no, it's not compatible with Wii-U or any console for that! Hope I could help out! :)
Well the plastic mold that you hold has the hole neccesary to allow that. But if you try to look through it you see there is no port, no way for actual electronic pieces to connect. I hope im making myself clear. Also when i connected mine, windows read it like "generic vibrator joystick" or something like that. But i havent seen mine do that. Not that it maters to me. Hope I was helpful.
Mine didn't come with software, per se, but I could usually re-map in game or in Windows. Had to download a free app to remap on my mac.
I've tried heating it with he headset but it just doesn't work. I'm currently ordering parts to to construct a very large microwave.
On a 360 you plug them into the controller for chat, and the console for game audio and power.
Yes you may need an adapter to convert your your headphone/line out jack to the RCA connections for the headphones.
So that's 2 yes and 1 no. What is it???
Vikki, I am not sure how many gaming chairs will have a USB port to support amplified headsets. Unless you can tell me which gaming chair it is, I would get a headset like the PX22, Shadow, or Z60 that has a detachable inline amp. These would work as a passive headset using a 3.5mm jack or an amplified headset with USB -- you would have options. Another option that does not use an inline amp at all is the X12 -- 3.5mm plug for game audio and a 3.5mm plug for chat audio. If you have a link to the actual chair I can investigate it for you.
Only if you purchase a headset audio adapter and route the game audio through your TV. You are better off with something like the XO ONE headset which includes the chat adapter and is compatible out of the box. Much cleaner set-up, newer headset, and you don;t have to purchase anything else.
My son has Xbox 360 3G. So I am not sure if it works with the 4th generation. I imagine it would though.
Probably not. These get audio from the RCA audio jacks and game audio from the 1/8 inch jack that connect to the xbox controller. If your using a tv with just a cable connection you could hook up a VCR and utilize that component to view channels and get the audio out. Or possibly connect directly to the output from the cable box as most of them have multiple outputs on them. Hope this helps.
Amanda this is strictly a wired headset, and while you can use it with a PC, it won't work with a mobile device. Let me know if you are looking for a wired or wireless device. And let me know if you want it to work with both an Xbox 360 AND a mobile device, or just a mobile device. I can give you both wired and Bluetooth options for both scenarios.
If by everything you mean everything you need to hook it up to your tv and xbox to make it work then yes, yes it does
I've tried heating it with he headset but it just doesn't work. I'm currently ordering parts to to construct a very large microwave.
On a 360 you plug them into the controller for chat, and the console for game audio and power.
Yes you may need an adapter to convert your your headphone/line out jack to the RCA connections for the headphones.
So that's 2 yes and 1 no. What is it???
Vikki, I am not sure how many gaming chairs will have a USB port to support amplified headsets.

Yes, it works with PC. The chat volume wheel controls the sound from the computer. All you have to do is plug in the headset, the drivers automatically install. Just make sure that the headset is set to be your default device in the sound settings.
Yes I just checked my daughters hookup and all she has plugged in is the USB. She says the other wires are for systems that don't have USB ports.
It can hook up to both. the USB is for the mic and hearing other people's mics, and the audio/video is so you can hear the game through the headset.
Yes it will, it will work with all consoles and computers cause it uses a USB port for power.
Not sure length but more than 10. I sit back and still have cord and it's plugged in back of tv and front of the PS3
usb port in front or on back of ps3
Yes, thes bass feels great. You can also adjust the bass settings on your PC to your liking.you can't adjust the base from the headphones, so you will to do it through your PC. I hope this helps
Yes they are. My sister uses glasses and uses the headphones. She tells me that they are comfortable.
if you still have the original ps3 tv plug in wich is red white and yellow your supposed to connect those together. These cables are only to control the volume of the headset. So you should be good without them.
You can hear the game when playing on-line and when playing alone off-line
It has in it Cleopatra 2, Coyote Moon, Triple Stars, Siberian Storm, Aztec Temple, Bombay, Three Kings, Lotus Flower, Glitter Kitty, Wild Wolf It includes other less popular machines. Hope this helps.
I would be glad to answered, when I tried to download to my computer and zoom picture is not able to adjust...I had the help from online and they told me to tell the Amazon that it willl not work on Windows 7.
Cleopatra2- Coyote moon- Double diamond- Double diamond 3x 4x 5x- Kitty glitter- Lotus flower- Secrets of stonehenge- Siberian storm- Three kings- Treasures of troy- Triple double 7s- Triple stars- Wild wolf- Aztec temple- Bombay
I couldn't play it on any of three systems I tried...save your money - this game is a bust.
I never had a problem
I was so frustrated with this game. I have several slot games and never had one that wouldn't load properly. I bought my game in October, but when I looked at more recent reviews, people still seem to have problems with launch. I would like to have this slot game too...if it would work! I would not recommend buying this game. It's not that it wasn't like the ones in the casino, or worked too slowly or didn't pay off too much or too little, it didn't work at all! Buyer beware! Look at the number of reviews that have the exact same complaints about the game and then decide it you think you might get one that actually works. I do have a laptop and some people have said that is why it didn't install, but I have 3 WMS and Reel Deal slots that work perfectly fine on my laptop. Good luck!
this is a piece of crap , don't buy
The games on the disk are Big Bad Spins, Goddess of the Sea, Red, Spiderweb, Wild Stallions, Gnaughty Gnomes, Luckiest Catch, Sparkle, Tumtum, Wild Virus, Four Seasons, Girl's Night Out, Stone Age Spins, Treasures of the Pharaohs, Water World, Dueces Wild, Jacks or Better, Double Premium Poker, Triple Premium Poker and Jokers Wild. Hope this helps.
are u talking about chicken coop or are u talking about something else?
Simply contact www.PhantomEFX.com and they will send you a link to a patch that will fix this problem.
It has been a while since I played this game so I really don't remember. I believe I just clicked in and out of the portals until I discovered how many crystals I had. Either way, the game keeps up with the amount of crystals and once you open all the games, I think that is when you save the forest.
It says on the package a minimum of Windows XP, Vista and 7 (32 or 64 bit). I have Windows 7. Sorry I cannot help you more.
I didn't need the disc. However, on some of these games, it requires a disc.
It has been a while since I played it but there are a variety (straight, stacked wilds, and card). The special feature is a game where you play to build a meter and once the meter is full more games appear. Hope that helps.
Off hand, No. I can't list the games, however, there are quite a few games and it is extremely enjoyable. You have to play to unlock future games. When you gain enough points or charms, it allows you to open a new game. You will like it.
I cannot answer, as I never could get game to load. Sorry.
it sounds tiny because it is 150 ohms so it needs an amp to push it but the pc 360 are 50 ohm and dont need an amp ... jus look for a headset with 50 or less ohms and u wont need an amp
This is what I bought with the Sennheiser PC 350 headset, they work perfectly together. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036VO4XO/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Obvious question: Is it in the upright position (microphone piece)? you must extend it outward to unmute it. Windows 7: Not so obvious: Goto system tray: Right click "Sound" (Speaker Icon) Click 'Sounds' in the context menu that pops up. In the Sound Dialog Box, look for 'Recording'. Speak into your microphone, and observe whether or not green bars are displayed to the right of the active/default device (notated by a green check mark). If a device that is not notated by a green check mark lights up, right click that device and make it the default microphone. Problem Solved. If the device that is notated by a green check mark lights up, right click that device and select Properties. Proceed to 'Levels' tab at the top of the new Microphone properties dialog box. Locate 'Microphone' and adjust the slider beneath it to the maximum volume level. Add some 'Microphone Boost' as well. Go half way on the slider for experimental reasons. Click OK Right click the microphone again, except this time click 'Configure speech recognition' instead of properties. Run through wizard and test your microphone.
They cord is quite long. I measured and it is approximately 9.5 feet long.
Both headsets are somewhat similar. The Special Edition has its volume control built-in on the right ear cup, which in my opinion, is much better. Also, the PC 350 SE comes with a carrying case, while if I'm not mistaken, the old 350 does not. Overall, the PC 350 SE is a totally improved PC 350, so the obvious choice would be to buy the SE, rather than buying the older model.
No it doesn't... You can get a usb adapter though.
no plastic but it is sturdy
I wear them for hours at a time while wearing my glasses and they are very comfortable.
go with the pc350se IF you don't want to hear anything but whats coming through the headphones. I think overall I like the PC350se's better because of construction. I actually prefer to hear things in the room and the pc360's are nice for that, plus I think I prefer their sound slightly better but I had to sell one so I sold the PC360's. I use the "Listen to this device" soundblaster option so I can at least hear myself talk through the microphone on the pc350se's
The PC350 is CLOSED back meaning they offer pretty good noise cancellation but the sound is isolated within the earcup. The PC360 is OPEN back meaning they leak sound but have a MUCH better soundstage (the perception you gain of where the sound is coming from) than a closed back headset. I have both (PC 350 and PC 360) and the PC 360 wins, hands down. I cannot describe to you the difference between open back and closed back. You just have to experience it for yourself. At first, I thought I wanted a closed back headset (PC 350). Now, having experienced the soundstage presented by an open back headset (PC 360), I am convinced that an open back design is the best.
Yes sir it is ^___^
Yes sir it is ^___^
If you mean a plastic case then yes. I have one on mine and it still has room.
Yes, perfectly
If it adds lots of width then no. The 3DS XL is comfortably filling the case
It can hold up to 6 games (7 if you include a game in your 3ds like I do). As for the thicker stylus, it really depends on the measurements of the stylus because the slot that I see can hold a thickee stylus as long as it is no longer than 3-4 inches or so.
Holds 6, description is inaccurate.
Holds easily 12 games but charger will not fit at all.
It's a soft interior hard shell case for the XL. Storage space for 3 games perfectly, might fit with a small case on the 3DSXL. I've had mine over a year now and it's held up perfectly.
You shouldn't have an issue. Might be a little snug.
Yes! I use it all of the time when I take it to school and it's great. I feel safe that it wont move around while in case or get face damage because the outer layer provides enough protection. Hope this helps!
Yes it is
It does have offline Multi-player (split-screen) up to 4 players. We've done 2 player split-screen mostly.
I know the game works on PS3 but I don't know about the controllers I am sure they would work....the game is for the PS3 only but if ps4 controller can be program to the PS3 I don't see why it wouldn't work
It's regular version
Of course I get invites from online friends all the time and conversely invite my friends for races. I've had great fun.
What region? Most are locked when you start the game.
I didn't see an expiration date on any included material. If the game is new, you shouldn't have any issues.
No. You can play the game with a controller. You do not need a racing wheel. As far as which racing wheel you should buy, I don't really know because I don't have one. But I would assume that any racing wheel would work as long as the game supports use of that peripheral. It's a fun game so either way, I think you'll enjoy it. Have fun!
when going through the option in the game the control only has 2 options and the both option are using the analog stick to steer, the d-pad is to look back ... so it looks like you can't switch it to d-pad.
Not this game but GTA.
Don't know as my grandsons birthday is next week so he hasn't played it yet.

Yes yes yes..... In fact windows 8 is the best platform to run battlefield on you will get extra frames opposed to Windows 7.
in http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/ click campaign!
No
Yes, because you use battlelog for launching sp campaign
if you want it on dvd it will be deviled but if you buy it via digital edition then amazon will email you youre ea origin code so that you can activate youre copy of the game. i hope my answer helps you out Benny
As of right now, there is no prebundled BF4 that has premium access. The premium still needs to be purchesd separately from the game. Im sure as more time passes, EA will release a premium edition game
Download the game from disc and go. Disc doesn't have to be in computer to use.
Yes. My daughter plays it on windows 8. :)
Yes! There is even a chance to have baby triplets.
I looked online for an answer to this question and it seems you can change the language to Dutch if you are willing to edit your system registry files. There is a You Tube video showing how to do this (http://youtu.be/4BxpBYoA7Sk) and webpage with the same information (http://sims3.crinrict.com/en/2013/04/change-the-language.html). Please be advised that changing registry information can make Windows, your game, and/or your computer to stop working properly; You must feel comfortable and knowledgeable before taking this action of editing. If the links I have included are not posted by Amazon just Google/search "how to change language on sims 3" or " sims 3 in other languages" Please note that the region of the disc will limit the installation choices for language from the game start up screen. Region 1 appears to only offer the game in English, Spanish, and French. Region 2 appears to have a few more options for languages. Because of these region limitations, registry editing is the only way to change the language if it is not offered on the start up screen. Also know that if you edit your registry for the game to Dutch (nl-NL) you will need to do the same for all expansion pack registries. Finally, remember the Sims speak their own language so if you are attempting to make the Sims characters speak Dutch it is impossible. The Sims characters all speak Simlish - Sims language that cannot be changed. Good luck to you with this and be very careful if changing your registry. Note: I have never personally changed my game's language. This information is based on what I found by research online (I was curious myself if it could be done successfully.)
yes
You'll need to buy the original Sims 3 separately.
Correct. You must have the Sims 3 base game to play any of the expansions
yes it did on mine ,If your having trouble getting it on yours try installing using administrator some times the computer is older then the game or the game is older then the computer. Hope this helps good luck .
It's on the back of the pamphlet that comes inside the case
I don't know
Yes
yes you can
It is my understanding that they offer only a single or three-user license. They are very helpful, go on-line and get their contact telephone number for sales they can give you the details
Only if you want to upgrade to unlimited employees. The Enhanced will only allow you to pay up to three employees. If you process more than three you will be charged by Quickbooks per employee.
Yes. Here is the official Intuit position on this: "With a single-user license, you can install QuickBooks on 1 computer and on 1 additional portable computer (e.g., a laptop that you own and use in your business) as long as both devices are used by the same person. ONLY that specified person can access and use QuickBooks on both computers." My note: the second computer does NOT need to be a laptop or portable, but the rest of the conditions apply. Let me know if you need more info.
Extra $100 for 4+ employees. I just called. It's a bit of a hassle if you already have a payroll subscription, like I do. First you have to cxl your current subscription, then install the payroll disc and then call and they charge you the full whack ($429) for enhanced payroll, then credit back the value they assign to the enhanced payroll of 3 or fewer employees ($329). SO, if you get the enhanced payroll for less than $329 off the shelf (i.e. Costco or Amazon), then you decide if it's worth the hassle. From everything I've read, the 2013 QB Pro is not something to be super excited about, and may even boggle your brain due to poorer visual interface, new report menu format, etc. I'm thinking about getting the Value pack and if I can do the payroll only, and without simultaneously upgrading the QB Pro, then that's what I'll do for now.
I hope you do back up. I would think your company has disappeared so you'll have to do a restore:( Good Luck. Ask again if you need more info. Michael
I believe you will have to backup QB to zip drive at the office and bring the zip drive home to update QB there.
Yes it includes a 1 yr subscription. I find this amazing because Quckbooks was going to charge me in Oct. $349.00 for my one year but I saved that by buying the QB's Pro 2013 upgrade and the one year P/R. I guss I will buy a payroll package from Amazon each year now.
I don't think you will able to do that, you might call quickbooks.
The answer is on your payroll key. It says unlimited or 0-3 employees
Yes, Intuit will still provide support even though you don't purchase the product directly from them. We have had no problem with calling them up and asking for assistance. You get the actual QuickBooks Pro 2013 - 3 User product.
The short answer is yes you can. You have to have a server set up (which you must have done) and be able to get through your firewall. Perhaps you have security set up already and will need to use tunneling software from a remote location.
This is a disc.
The Mac platform requires the Mac version of QBooks. It has the capability of converting the data back and forth between the Mac and PC versions if required. There are also a few functionality and feature differences between the Mac and PC versions, but they are pretty close.
I think that is one for Quicken staff. I would think it is one or the other. Disk or download. Not sure, but disk is sometimes a little higher price than download. I choose disk because I move around to different machines and I think it would be less hassle than placing or removing the licenses on those machines.
No, it is not possible for the 4 users to work at the same time. You definitely would need a multi user version.
Yes! There are 8 kinds of element giant skylander, you can use any one to explore a place or to break something where you find a giant icon. And you may some bonus or some stuff. Anyway you don't need to use giants still can finish the game (not completed), otherwise waste $$ on giants.
No. If you go to the Skylanders Activision game page for Giants, towards the bottom it lists the systems it is available for. PS2 is not there. Here is the link to that page. http://www.skylanders.com/video-games/skylanders-giants Look towards the bottom, there is a bit picture of the character Hot Head and it lists the systems there and also at the bottom of each particular game page. This means they only made and sold starter packs, which you have to have so you can have the portal for the figure to sit on and the game disc, for those systems.
Sorry I don't know as we have Xbox, and my son usually only plays with them on the ipad version. The info at the very top of the page for the item (under the name) states: Platform: PlayStation, Xbox
I bought it for WII 2 but I have been told it will work with either. It did work on the WII.
Not, this character don't work wii u, you need special one

You can pay 13 bucks a month for a limit of 1 character PER server(not data center. The data center is basically the mega server that hosts all the little servers/worlds). Save yourself a couple of bucks...as you don't really need multiple characters anyways...as you you can play ALL jobs with one character AND you can change your race once in the game.
Yes it does you get one free month to play then every month after is $15.00
I bought and used it through the ff website since I had an account from the free trial. So the answer is steam free.
Yes, as long as your pc is bluetooth compatible.
As far as I know there is no problem with the disk you should be able to use it.
No choice between the two;;
Yes you will have to buy a second copy for a second account. You will need another serial number is the reason. There is a 14 day free trial that just came out she can use to try the game for free as well.
This game is online play only. It is very similar to WoW's game play but with the Final Fantasy feel to it. It is much different from Final Fantasy XI. All in all this game is fun if you have a few friends to play with. I didn't care for the game much until I played it for a few weeks.
Absolutely not! I havent had a more friendly environment than this game. Sure there are gold spammers here and there, but thats pretty much EVERY game. But as far as bots go? Who? Where?
Sorry, it is online only, no counsel only single player story.
Yes. I bought it for my son and he uses it on the Wii.
Yes. The figures are universal. They work with any system.
The package was not sealed but everything was included, code, etc.
Yes but not by design. Different consoles and tv's provide varying resolutions of the game graphics. The character will be the same on any console. However how clear the detail is and the colors will differ. Even on two consoles of the same kind. (Because tv is different)
It's a universal figure
I only have a PS3 so I cannot say how it will work on a DS
I'm sorry, i'm not even sure what they are. My grandson requested it for an Easter present.

No, and strongly advise you not waste your money
No you don't, you insert a flash drive to your Xbox move what items you want to the flash drive. After you done that install the new hard drive and then you can move what you have on the flash drive to the hard drive.
If its the one from haussbell, no. You have to buy the $60 from the Microsoft seller for it to work with original Xbox games. Anything but the specific Microsoft brand will not play original Xbox games.
Yes,it will. I installed bf3 with no problems. But doesn't BF4 require a whole lot more than that?
Its not OEM so model numbers won't help but I assure you it will work with your 360 s as it did with my 360 s to test for my nephews 360 e
I'm not sure, he don't have that game, but we have been having issues with our XBOX live. He can't play online and hasn't been able to in a week. The hard drive does work. I had to figure it out. But it works.
I am sure you can, just use the Xbox like a computer when it ask you where to save it you will have the option to either use either storage area's. Hope this was helpful.
I have no experience with that issue. The only thing I know is that this hard drive is specifically for the 360 SLIM, so if you are using it on a standard 360 that could be the problem; although I'm not a tech or a gamer. I bought it for my grandsons 360 Kinect Slim. Sorry I couldn't be more help to you.
Yes
I have a windows 8 it works jus fine you can check this site to see if The Sims 3 runs on your computer. http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/ when you reach the site just type The Sims 3 and it will tell you if it can work. Because it really depends on the graphics and other hardware. Good luck
All of The Sims 3 games, ie seasons, are expansion games of the original game. They add new features to the original game play. If you want to wait, Sims 4 is planned for release at the end of the year.
It requires the Sims 3 base game. This is an expansion to the base game.
I don't think it matters as long as you have the base game.
Yes I bough some from orgin and amazon and they work fine !
Yes, you download the extra game content and they send an email with the game code you need. It's pretty easy.
I would uninstall and reinstall and check for an update

Yes. They even have presets on Synapse 2.0 for this.
It is always green but you can change the brightness.
This one for sale is NOT the stealth addition, however this being the 2013 still has the matte finish. The one from 2012 is glossy with blue lights, the 2013 is matte with green lights. Source: viewed in person at store
Yes, you can use this with windows 8.
Yes, the Ultimate uses Cherry MX Blue key switches. The Stealth - which is quieter - uses Cherry MX Brown.
Yes. The space bar, backspace, enter, any key that isn't the size of a letter key will sound different because they use a leveling bar. Still a MX blue underneath, but the leveling bar make a different sound
Looks like the ultimate doesn't have lit keys
this is my son's purchase but I asked and yes, you can dim it to all-the-way-turn-off the back light
I bought it a while ago and from this one I got the mx blues. I do not know if it has changed but the ones I am using from when I got this from a few months ago is mx blues. "Razer Black widow Ultimate 2013 Elite Mechanical Gaming Keyboard" is what is says under product description. I am going to say they are MX blues but not 100% sure. 2013 are mx blues anyways. Hope this has helped you.
Yes it does ive had a problem with it but amazon fixed it right away everything is perfectly fine now.
We actually purchased 2 for Christmas gifts for our grandsons. One was almost eight years old. The other was three and a half. Both do fine with it. We make sure we purchase age appropriate games.
Taiwan and use it comes with both in an unopened box.
Yes it does works great
Nop...
If you are asking about the number of games there is a lot if you want to use the old DSI games they can be played on the 3d DSI but 3d games can not be played on the DSI. Our family has both. We have 3 my grandson and I have the old DSI but my husband has the 3rd. I like the DSI not so much the 3d only because the screen is small. I have bought used games on Amazon and Have not had a problem
In the words of Chief Keef, "Nah"
Yes, i play ds games in R4 card
It doesn't take batteries, it has a charger which plugs in to an outlet.
Of course it does! Nintendo is the Nutella of handheld gaming!
Excellent sound quality for the money, two year warranty. Buy with confidence.
Yes
I just stretched it across my room to measure it for you and i ran out of room lol. It's over 15 ft. Very long.
I believe it should work with the astro amp with its USB Input but I used it without an amp and it worked excellently with good hefty sound right out of the box on its own.
The short answers is NO. Sennheiser makes no mention of Wii U compatibility in manuals or on there website, however, in a pastemagazine online review, they state, """"And they work well for the Wii U, too, even though there's no mention of Nintendo's weird little system on the U320's packaging."""" We do not have a Wii U to try and verify this so take this information at your own risk.
No. It doesn't have the audio jack cable thing
I think it may use both, Im still thinking if ill order one but I remember reading about this on the Sennheiser website. Id say give it a look. These are Xone compatible so thats why Im taking interest.
Yes
Not sure. I can, however, tell you that the chat volume switching did not work for me on my PS4. The volume of the headset was also kind of low. I ended up returning mine and got an Afterglow headset that GameStop currently has on clearance. Check for these in your area. They are clearance priced down to $149.99. http://www.imgur.com/IH1P0m1.jpeg

I don't think so.
I am not sure, I play the game on my Win 7.
It seems like you got the PC download version. There is a PC and a Mac download. Sadly, I don't think there are refunds on digital media.
I dont know if the download through amazon includes it but when i downloaded it through steam it wasnt included
Yes it will
No, this download is from PC only.

I successfully played/completed the game on Windows 7, no problems.
Yes
No, my strategy guide does not have blurry pictures.
Also, run the installer with administrative privileges. No problems
Yes, I have windows 8.1 and it runs fine, good luck.
The game can be played offline, but the game does have a multiplayer feature.
It runs fine from what I can tell
Hi, Brian. I suggest downloading the Gold Edition that has the U Boat version included. I forgot what the version is called but I am very pleased with this game and you really can't beat the price. One thing this game requires a lot!!!! of patience to play it in real mode. I hope this helps.
Most digital games don't come with the manual. Use the link below for a PDF version of it. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&ei=CLyEU9-mJpCjqAaX-YFo&url=http://mypdfmanuals.com/user-manual,GAMES%2BPC,SILENT%2BHUNTER%2B4,602056.pdf&cd=1&ved=0CCQQFjAA&usg=AFQjCNFV8O1WEi34883ajt3DDPsn9207vw
The core application is for the U.S. subs in the pacific against the Japanese. SH4 Gold includes all of the U-Boat missions that occurred in the Pacific. So it is like two games in one.
Yes I have windows 8 and it runs excellent.
I have not played this product on steam. I downloaded it from amazon directly to my computer. The product comes with a key that you have to use while installing the game.

If I understand your question correctly, yes it's is two peices one that goes over the top an one over the bottom.
Yes, everything is easy to get to. All of the buttons, 3D slider, Sound, stylus, camera, speakers, is open. The picture and shipped product match. I have big man hands, and this fits.
No, it wouldn't. The dreamGEAR IS A CASE WITHIN ITSELF. It gives a great controller feel to it and provides security from accidental drops, NOT any intentional spikes to the floor. Overall. From one gamer to another, this completed my XL gaming experience!
Sadly no, it more of stretches around the handheld than a snug look and the button perforation isn't set for the new 3ds xl. You can mod it but the whole thing slips off pretty easy being that it doesn't fit correctly.
yes, i had the same cramping problem and this totally helped my hands stay more relaxed. your fingers will curl around the bottom cushion and not the small plastic console. it comes as two pieces, screen cover and finger pad cover. any more questions, let me know.
NO. This WILL NOT fit the New 3DS XL that released in Feb 2015. The NEW model has extra buttons, has the stylus and cartridge slot in different spots and is slightly bigger. I contacted the manufacturer and they responded saying there will be a new one for the NEW 3DS XL sometime around April 2015. No exact date though.
Yes there will be a new one for the NEW 3DS XL that released in Feb 2015. I contacted the manufacturer and they responded saying sometime around April 2015. No exact date though.
Yes, it will close. There are two separate covers for the top and buttom of the 3ds xl. The game will open and close easily.
The Dreamgear fits skin-tight so, no, it won't fit over a protective plastic case without stretching too much and possibly tearing.
Unfortunately it cannot fit the DSi XL....sorry. Yes I do have the DSi XL and tried it but it didn't work :p
Just the Wii U. It uses a standard 1/8" stereo plug with mic that plugs into the headphone jack on the Wii U GamePad. There is nowhere on the original Wii to plug it in.
Yeah u can hear in the game and video or use it with ur phone
That option is part of the wii u. do there is nothing to fix.
Well the problem is very simple, this headset is made ONLY for the Wii U and 3DS. It won't work on a tablet. As for your 3DS XL....it works on my NORMAL 3DS...I don't like the XL so I'm not sure if it would work on the XL or not, I think both the Normal and XL 3DS use the same head jack, so basically this would work on your 3DS XL, but it wont work on the tablet. It was specifically made for the Wii U and 3DS ONLY.
wii u to wii u calling program. black ops 2 ghosts super smash bros (only for multiplayer with friends) also probably works in a computer with mic test,
No. It's permanently attached.
Yes you can
Yes

Well my son has the Wii u and uses it when he plays Black ops game to talk with the other players in game mode.

I am guessing yes. Well constructed though, cause you still get the tactile feedback and it has a low profile.
it is 8.5 inches by 20 inches, it fits on a small keyboard tray, not a lot of room left, but enough to tightly fit a mouse
I measured mine... it's five feet long.
Yes. It may take a few steps but it can work. you might need to take the .exe file once it's downloaded and put that in compatibility mode for it to work. I have windows 8.1 and the only thing giving me issues is the fact i'm running it on a lower-end laptop.
Works fine, i'm running windows 7 64 bit, already beat both episodes.
Yes.I tested freeroam out and it works.
I think strictly U.S.
There is a Games for Windows Live update that Microsoft has available on their website. After installing the game Windows 8.1 gave me a dialog box that said there was a known comparability issue and provided the link to the download within the dialog.
Yes that is what I play it on.
Yeap and its smooth
It it's compatible with Windows 7 but there is no guarantee it will run well. The problem isn't your version of Windows but how poorly it was changed to work on any computer.
I had to do something with windows to get it to work. Can't remember what exactly. As for Europe i m guessing it shouldn't make a difference.
It also doesn't work for me.

Hi, I don't know what version it is, I think it may be the cyborg version and yes the keys do light up and yes you can choose the colour
Yes but you will void the warranty.
Yes Bruce. This was a big concern of mine as well. I am stationed overseas and was worried I would have to use a transformer. It supports 100-240V.
Im sorry I no longer own the keyboard. I sold it because it we terrible!
I don't know about rollover, but this is a membrane keyboard: "Replete with a specially engineered membrane which mimics the tactile feel generated by the mechanical keys often preferred by gamers - - without the resultant excessive noise." I'd assume (if this statement is correct) that it mimics cherry mx brown switches, except for a lower activation point.
It is a great looking keyboard, for sure, and might even have worked...that is, if I could have ever have gotten it to work with Windows 8.1 I was forced to return it because there were problems with the Windows 8.1 drivers...they may be fixed now, but I doubt it based on everything I could discover on the web about the keyboard. It was a few months ago, so you might give it a try but just wanted to let you know the problems I had with it.
There are three buttons on the LCD touch screen. These buttons are basically different modes where you can have totally different key bindings and backlight coloring/brightness. I do not think (but I haven't tried, so I'm not totally sure) that you can change the color of the lighting without accessing the touch screen (i.e. automatically). That being said: I've been using a standard $20 keyboard for gaming for 5 years, and I love this gaming keyboard. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask.
ANSI
All I can say man is good luck, I tried for almost two months to get in touch with mad catz about this very item, never managed, so now my keyboard sits in a box and I tell everyone not to buy their products.
I am sorry. This was a gift for a friend of a friend overseas
Yes it does, I use mine with my nexus 7 all the time. Pops right up with bluetooth pairing.
Well as far as I have investigated, there's a problem. Im trying to smooth out a connection issue with my galaxy SIII, and two of these controllers. I can get them to connect, assign them a control 1 and control 2, but they act as the same controller. I kinda lost interest in messing with it. Far as a ipad, im not sure what your outcome will be. However I think its possible, though difficult to get them to cooperate.
This controller only works on the android and windows devices. There are apple controllers available, however I cant vouch for any of them. Search youtube for "ipad Bluetooth game controllers reviews" should point you in the right direction.
Yes, as far as the mini box has Bluetooth. On both with games that support a gamecontroller
Works with my Galaxy S5 just fine.
Hi Lez, I don't have access to a Hisense TV, but this controller works very well with a tablet and an android tv box y have, so I suppose that if you tv is an android one with BLUETOOTH capabilities, it will do the work. Good luck.
Could not get it to work with the fire stick
With the Fire TV box, it worked with directional arrows but it wouldn't let you select anything. It stopped syncing almost immediately. It looks great but I don't think it was made for this interface. Save your money.
Hold one of the action buttons (A/B/X/Y) for whichever function you want, and then press and hold the power button until the lights on the front flash. Then use your android bluetooth settings to scan for available devices and pair it there. A is keyboard mode (emulators) and X is gamepad mode (supposedly for 3D games, but never works). You have to unpair the device every time you finish with it before you re-search.
No it dont work with ios what a fules claim that it does
Am not sure how people saying it works on Windows 7 or "I don't know" offers an answer to this question.
baccarat, poker (various), blackjack, pai gow poker, video poker and blackjack, video Texas hold-em
yes it works great & was easy to install
No, it does not have the Elvis the King slot. Not including the 2 bonus slot games which are older, the slots that are in the game are: Alien Invasion Blossom Bucks Blue Plate Bug Out Cold Cash Couch Potato Cover The Spread Emerald Oasis, 3, 5 & Progressive Flying High Funny Money Jewelry Box Margarita, 3, 5 & Progressive Monsters Ninjas of the Caribbean Pinata Payout Progressive Fruit Road Pizza Ruby River, 3, 5 & Progressive Sapphire Sea Shoes Shooting Stars Six Shooter Sugar Daddy Sweet Success Three Wishes Wild Wheel
Yes, it does!
Yes.
Sure are
yes, it does! I had an older version & when I installed the new one my old face was included. Saved a lot of time for me!!
Yes it can be played on a laptop or desktop and after its installed CD is not needed to play
I use it with windows 7 so I can't answer your question.
Hi, actually a bug difference in size. Don't know if have other mayor difference in function. I do recommend to buy a battle bag, because the mine was difficult to close and don't fit well and yes, I have a PS4 and it fit
when the game system is on the bottom (in its position) there is a beautiful screen built into it ... that's why it cost so much .... and the sound is awesome ... I still love it, had it for almost a year now.
Its a 6 inch HDMI cord and not a composite cable a.k.a red,white, yellow thing (winks)
I am not sure,..I think so,..but he is deployed..will ask him when avail..
It does have one HDMI connector. The monitor has it's own speakers and hat are powered by the monitor's power supply. It's supposed to work with the PS and the Xbox one but not having either of those I can't verify that.
Yes it works you just need the conversion kit off the gaems website to make it able to carry it securely.
The One fits in the case just like the 360.
Yes
No
No
Using them in Xbox or Playstation you shouldn't, using PC I can't tell. IMHO, A50 works really good and deliver good sound, but do'nt expect a real 7.1 sound experience.
Yes it comes with all the cables you need to connect the base audio.
Yup..both windows 8 and 8.1
I have to wear glasses all the time too. I have no issues with these headsets with my glasses.
Yes. 360, PS3, PC, PS4, and Xbox One with Xbone headset adapter.
Yes it is surround sound. And I'd say the battery will last me a good 10-12 hrs of straight usage time.
Audio yes but there is a catch for the mic to work. Unlike the PS4 and PC which work out of the box, you'll need to plug in the included audio cable from the headset to your Xbox One controller for chat to work. It's an xbox limitation and not an Astro limitation.
Yes, it comes with both the stand and the mix amp, they're both in the box when you buy it
Absolutely. It took me months to have the issue resolved with my headset, and you can never actually speak to a person directly, only through e-mails that they do not respond to in any decent time frame.

Absolutely. It took me months to have the issue resolved with my headset, and you can never actually speak to a person directly, only through e-mails that they do not respond to in any decent time frame.
No
Unfortunatly not. It's the only drawback besides the wireless controllers. Get some wired genesis controllers.
No it does not but you should be able to buy the cartrhdges sepeeatly and play them on it
Yes, this ATGames produced Genesis console will play Japanese Mega Drive games without the need for it to region modded (which is a plus in my book).
I'm not sure ,but there maybe a you tube video where someone test that issue I would suspect that any non licensed sega may possibly not work but, I own this it's more than worth it I use it everyday it's a must have with the games built in alone I don't even use the cartridge slot it's a great product I'm very happy with it
I dont believe you can. Only thing with my game, i'm having trouble with, is that the wires have a short somewhere and is very touchy. Kinda sucks cause i just bought this recently. Maybe thats why they sold it. Hmmm
As in you want to use this with direct current? You could use adapters for your application, remember to have some sort of breaker in line so you dont destroy anything
No. It does not.
Yes
It's completely different retron 3 as no games built in this one does
Unfortunately no, in fact there are no castlevania games on it at all :(
No. It does not support multi-task. You can try Android-based game console, such as JXD s5800.
No there was no facebook back in 1990 when the Genesis came out
yes
Yes
coolroms.com, go on youtube and check out the videos on how to download them. ex. how to load genesis roms on atgames handheld.
if the game has a password system then it works fine, however i dont think you can do save states and other emulator stuff like that.
Yes. It is like a mini lcd screen. Very good picture quality. Something is off about the sound or the speaker.
Yes, we can ship to Italy. Priory mail will be $40. 00 with delivery with in 6-10 days or First Class mail @ $28.40 with delivery between 2-4 weeks depends on destination. Thank you,
No. It only has the preloaded games. It has no place for game cartridges. There are about half Sega games and half random games that were never on Sega and basically fillers, like card games.
no
The buyer, I purchased my controller from, sent a silicone protector with my controller.
Yes. I use it for tennis, baseball, golf, & bowling.
Yes it did. It also came with a silicone case as well.
Yes, it comes with a silicone cover.
It does not, what you see is what is there, the is one other button that is on the back and that is the trigger
Our wii is about 5 years old and it works great with it.
No
No
it takes just 2 AA batteries (included). The battery pack is optional.
for certain games, yes, u need a nunchuk. but this remote does not come with a nunchuk if that's what u mean

Yes, Windows 8.1.
A few of the games might work if you are lucky. For the most part, no.
It comes with a cheaply produced notecard sized picture of a mammoth tank with some crappy plastic border.
Yes
NO it is pc based check with EA they may have made a mac version but I do not think so
Most play fine on 8.1. I've had trouble with the older games like the original Command and Conquer. Hope this helps.
I play Tiberian Dawn, Red Alert 1, and Tiberian Sun on it. You may need some patches, google them and it will work.
It should it isn't restricted to the USA. Just a note though: It won't work on Windows 8, but will with Windows 7 & Vista. Probably will with Windows XP as well, but Microsoft has discontinued the support of that now obsolete OS system. :(
No
Yes
It doesn't need Batteries.. is not wireless uses a USB cable
Never used it and the button was firm enough that I never accidentally activated it.
Try RMA through MadCatz, but they are very strict on their warranty/support. Don't be surprised if you get turned away (I did).
There is a software disk that comes with this mouse. In that software is where you can bind the thumb wheel to a key. The software only works with Apple and Microsoft op systems.
I don't think so. The software that comes with it is for Apple and Windows PC. If you are going to use just the normal mouse buttons and not the software to customize the functions then I would think that you would be OK too.
I have no idea, i got the gloss black one which is about $95. You should totally go for it, its a great mouse and you will love it. BTW when i got my RAT5 a few years ago it was almost $70...
Yep.
it comes with 3 different palm pads, 3 pinky rests/pads, 6 weights, and the allen-key to change it all out.
Exactly 72" from exiting the mouse to where it enters the USB connector. Also, I can't in good conscience leave out the fact that these have terrible reliability though. Look up Mad Cats mouse hyper click issues and scroll issues. Their customer support is good though. If you do buy this mouse, keep every available proof of purchase you can for the entirety of its warranty. You'll need it in three months after purchasing...
You need to uninstall the USB Driver then restart your computer this will not hurt your computer as it will reinstall the drivers automatically when you boot your PC back up here is a link on how to uninstall your USB drives on youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8vXprEuAqM Hope this helps I work on and build Custom PC's for a living with over 3.5 years Experience I have my CompTIA A+ Certification and My Crisco Networking Certification Tommy R.
sorry for late respond my friend.... I use mine anywhere, right now i'm using it on a book XD... the only place that it can not be use is on glass, well, you can not use any mouse on glass field... I hope this answer helps you :)
My advice is DO NOT buy it again.
Of course. Any wired mouse is compatable with any operating system as long as your computer has a USB port (Your computer has a USB port).
I dont know... but is a very good mouse! assembled with high quality components
No
Yes
I had the double clicking happen, then it decided to just quit on me one day. quality is not goof.
Mine is about 4 and a half feet
Cobra DPI switches from 400/800/1600, the Mazer switches from 500/1250/1750/2500. The Cobra is red, Mazer is blue. Other than that they appear very similar. If you like a much higher DPI which is basically more sensitivity, the Mazer would work better.
I can't confirm if it does
Yes it does, perfectly. It's actually has the same wire settings for the Xbox controller. In the bottom of the chat pad there is a audio connect for your turtle beach/any other Xbox headset. So yes it does!
I'm not 100% sure but I'd assume it can.
I used this mouse for 2-3 years and the sensor on this mouse is very nice but every once in a while the sensor would skip ever so slightly. But the acceleration, the sensitivity to the clicks, and the programming of the modes is all fantatic. Over all this has to be one of the best mice I have ever owned.
The wheel is grooved and the mouse itself is heavy, so it's easy to press the wheel without scrolling or moving the pointer. It gives very little resistance when rolling, just enough that you can feel the grooves; and the wheel won't spin on its own if you flick it.
wired
Based on your definition I would call it "regular". The increments between scroll sections are distinct and well felt.
I think this mouse is not for FPS game.. in my opinion..
It has a great ROF and trigger response but rpaid fire to me sounds like a hack. So no it cant shoot faster if you push the click just once
I thought the same thing until I bought it and it's actually bigger than you would think. It's a comfortable fit and the features are great. I wouldn't use any other type of mouse.
It should be. The requirements are as follows: Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows Me, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 Pentium (or compatible) processor 64 MB RAM 20 MB available hard disk space CD-ROM drive USB port
I purchased the same unit for use with a Mac Pro running Mavericks. I use it with AeroFly. i did absolutely nothing to configure and it worked perfectly. All of the buttons were predefined. it works fantastic.
Yes
Try using qjoypad... it's at : http://qjoypad.sourceforge.net/...
Pam, No it is not...However Logitech might make a lefty....Jay
Perfectly! All the way to a Galaxy Note. This thing rocks. Good investment and makes games so much easier. Just get REAL BATTERIES. No cheap ones orb it won't connect at all.
Idk about the rechargeable batteries but it definitely fits the g-note 2. That's the same phone I use with it.
If you're especially tech savy; you can use it with emulators & other games, but you really need to know what you're doing. You can map the buttons & triggers nanually. Personally, I'm very content with the available games, & the list will only grow. Titles like NOVA, Dead Trigger 2 & Aliens vs Predator are amazing with the moga pro...console experience wherever you go. But get the moga pro if your going to get an android controller - it's waaay better (&more comfortable) than the original moga...
Works perfectly on an S5
It works with drastic, John gba, my boy, and a great color emulator but the driver apps are crappie and it doesn't like to stay connected for long if at all. The nyko one is infinitely better..
It takes ,2 AAA battery
I have only used Super GNES through the Google Play Store and it works great. I would make sure that the emulator application you are planning to use supports the Moga platform before you purchase it.
The unit is used in conjunction with your smart phone, in my case a Galaxy 3. The games are stored in the phone memory
Download ZeeMouse from http://www.bitbanksoftware.com/tinytools.html and it will let you map the buttons correctly. Works great!
Nope. Not at all. There is no port for this thing, and it doesn't charge over USB either. I can't stress enough exactly how much of a horrible purchase this is. Also, your tablet doesn't have bluetooth? Is it an Android? If it is, it should have bluetooth as an option, but it might not if it isn't one. Still, in all, DO NOT BUY THIS THING. It is a waste of time and money.
If you have Windows 7, use these instructions,
Well in not owning a Paspberry Pi I can't answer definitively. But seeing as how it's pretty much a very small computer I would hazard to say that as long as you're able to get the drivers for the the USB receiver on whatever OS you use on the Paspberry Pi you should be good.
No
Yes. 4 controllers and four headsets i believe.
Yes, it does. See other comments/instructions on how to install the drivers. The same steps apply to 7, 8, 8.1.
Yes
Yes, just be sure to download the 64 bit drivers.
I'm unsure. I'd go with a genuine adapter to T Try that. Just spend the extra X dollars and make life easier for yourself. The fake requires to use old drivers and install manual
yes
Because this is a generic model that doesn't accept the driver.
Paul, wish that was an option, I have the Zeus II and it will only play on my computer when a disc from EFX is inserted (it doesn't have to be specifically that disc)
yes it is, that's what I am running it on
Definitely It is a very good slots game
I have never had that problem. Maybe it was a fluke on that one program one time. I suggest if it continues you contact the tech dept. of the publisher. I have found most tech support departments have a great public relations record.
The gem points have given me bonus points or the "cute" prizes that are a part of the game showroom.
Yes. I had to connect one to my laptop.
Mine works fine, but there are patches to all the games available on the website of the company that makes these.
I don't remember any activation key, I just downloaded it...
I do not know.
Yes you do. :(
Yes! It holds up to 3 save files.
As far as I know, it's only in English, but it mostly uses pictures and numbers, so that doesn't matter.
No. You will need a 3DS to play this game.
You do need the 3ds. Have fun!
A patient 12 year old
3DS games will only work on 3DS gaming system. You can play nintendo ds games on a 3DS gaming system but the way the game cartridge for the 3ds is shaped it won't fit into a ds gaming system. Sorry.
I haven't tried. Very evil if you ask me. I know you can fast forward through the speeches if you press and hold the stylus to the bottom screen when he is speaking.
I dont think theres a way to alter the appearance of the devilish head. What do you mean about "stop the remarks about the scores"? You can try reseting them if thats what youre asking, but they will keep poping out every time you finish a training.

You have to have the game specific to your system, but the figures, adventure packs and battle packs will work on any game system.
I believe it's not system specific. As long as you have a portal and skylanders giants it should be fine. My son uses it on Wii.
Yes. As long as your playing skylanders giants. These will work with skylanders giants on any system.
place it on the portal with another skylander.
these are the small ones. They are about 2 1/2 to 3 inches tall. There are only 6 of the 5 to 6 inch tall ones in the giants series I believe. I am a very satisfied customer!! HAPPY PLAYING :)
Yes-you need the Skylanders portal and game and system such as Wii, Playstation or Xbox. Make sure you know if Skylanders Giants or Trapteam or Swap Force is actual game he has, as figures only work on certain games. Hope this helps.
The figure was a gift for my grandson and I know absolutely nothing about the characters or games. I'm sorry I can't answer your question. You might Google the question to see if it will work. Thanks.
Yes they do! As they come out with new game the old skylanders still work even with the new game. The new one just don't work with the old games. Example you can't use a swapforce with the giants game but you can use and skylander on the swapforce game. Hope that helps.
Sorry, you can't.
I'm really not sure ,sorry I can't help .
no, i don't think it will be a problem because i sweat when i play games too and it works perfect!
Yes
As far as I can tell there is no replacing of the cable unless you can ship it to Mad Catz.
Simply only middle mouse.
The mouse and its software work with Mac OS. Just as a side note, you will have to download the software for the mouse off of their downloads site in order to get the full benefit of the mouse (http://madcatz.com/downloads/).
I used it on Mint, and got it working, but it didn't perform as well as it did on windows. It broke and they wouldn't honor the warranty so I can't test on my current distro. I would say go with something else for Linux.
I'm pretty sure there is, however I had the same issue and they refused to honor the warranty.
Hello! We only ship to the US, Canada, UK, France, and Germany.
Hello! We only ship to the US, Canada, UK, France, and Germany.
It can be programmed using the software, but in all honesty this mouse is not worth it. The tracking on it cuts out quite frequently. It just sits in a drawer now because it is too frustrating to use.
Yes we had the same problem and this hard drive did the trick. It took about 30 seconds to install and the price is good
Xbox 360 S Console, Model #1439 is what it says on the back of mine and it fits perfectly
No it means that the laser lens needs to be cleaned with a disk with brushes. U can get 1 at the dollar store for 5$ and when you use it, let the whole cd run. I had the same problem till i used a laser lense cleaning disk
Yes, but the drive won't play older games
Yes
Yes
Not at all. It's basically a 60gb flash drive for your xbox. You just go through the content on your console and move it to the hard drive. It's really quite simple and does not do anything to your content.
Yes, it slides in and works
No tech knowledge required. Just pull pull the plastic panel off the the bottom of other Xbox and slide the drive in. There is only one way it will fit. Do a search on YouTube and you can see a quick video. It is super easy.
Yes it will. it fits in slims models and 4gb models. I bought mine about 3 months ago and am very happy with it.
This controller is for the Wii U only and will not work when playing Wii games on the Wii U.
You actually don't, most games have plenty of compatible controllers. I would recommend buying the pro controller if you find yourself uncomfortable with the wiipad.
I regret to inform you that it doesnt work at all after you boot the "wii" app on the wii u, I have both smash bros brawl and smash bros the first for N64, neither works
Its less sensitive than the Dualshock. It lasts longer than the dualshock and surprisingly it feels a bit comfortable than the dualshock. Theyre both great controllers but I can see the Wii U pro lasting a lot longer in quality.
Yes!
You cannot. The wii u pro controller has no motion controls built in.
Nope! It's the receiver is built into the Wii U just like Xbox and Sony have done
The Wii U Pro controller is only designed for Wii U games. Wii games on Wii U can only be played with controllers that were supported by the regular Wii, such as the regular Wiimote, wiimote+nunchuck, or the Classic Controller Pro. The Wii U also does not have slots for a gamecube controller so those can't be used as well. You'll need a wiimote, the good news is that a lot of Wii U games actually support this older controller and it can be used to navigate Wii U menus so it wouldn't be a bad purchase http://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Wii-Remote-Plus-Black/dp/B0094X28J0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412875287&sr=8-1&keywords=wiimote
Yes it can, but for wii virtual console games, you'll need a classic controller. For Wii U though, it should work with any vc game.
I have not done responsive test with controller connected to system.
I haven't had that problem. I do hear my voice through the TV speakers.
No, only for WII U
16ft
Can only be used with Wii u products, as far as i know. I know the microphone can only be used that way.
We don't have dance party, but on the other wii u sing party, it was just a plug and play and the mic worked great!
It's actually a USB plug. XLR would be nice, though.
It's plugs into the console not the pad. I don't know about the rest
I don't think so, this microphone was made for the wii u. I don't have a regular wii but u can check to see if the wii has a port u can plug in before u purchase.
We hooked it up yesterday and it seemed to work with the game. It was a little quiet but that was probably user error.
No it's junk. Doesn't work period
No it does not, It's made for Wii U only.
Yes it does! Rumble is here to stay. Although, over the ages and various controllers it differs from numbing like a pager to hard hitting. This is a middle ground. Gyro sensor is not in the controller - it's not like a wii mote, or six axis knockoff. It's a pure controller with analogs, digitals, and rumble. 80 hours of battery life too!
Yes they do..best Wii u controller
It doesn't. They're both just controllers.
As far as I'm aware, the pro controller should be region free. The gamepad however is region locked
The game pad that comes with the system uses a propietary connection type USB cable. The pro controller uses a mini USB cable. You can't interchange the two. The pro controller connects wirelessly to the console, but uses the cable for charging; same as the game pad. The game pad and pro controller do not connect to each other.
No
It can't be used as a PC controller conventionally (though of course there are people who have made it work through various outside means).
An extension controller is often used for the corresponding software. I can be connected to the main body up to four wireless.
it plays wii games also!
Hi M.J., I'm not entirely sure why it says 'almost' all Wii games. The Wii U actually has a Wii menu. When you select this Wii menu from the Wii U home screen, it looks exactly as the original Wii's home menu does. From here, you are able to play any Wii games you have, so long as you have the Wii remote and/or nunchuk that are required for the specific game because the Wii U gamepad cannot be used as a controller for original Wii games. Also, according to Nintendo's website, Wii games will not display in HD on the Wii U console, just as they wouldn't on the original Wii. So overall you should not have a problem playing any of your Wii games on the Wii U as long as they are not scratched or damaged too badly. Hope this helps.
It depends on where you buy from, a lot of different online stores in amazon charge different prices. If you are comparing 2 prices from amazon, one console might be on sale.
Yes it can!
All the peripheral devices from the wii work with the U, including the balance board. Original wii games also work on the U, including wii fit. However, the new wii fit U is a great upgrade from the original
Yes you can.
The Wii U and Wii are totally different systems, the names make that confusing. While Wii games will play in a Wii U, Wii U games will NOT play in a Wii. Sorry if that seems obvious, I've had a lot of confused friends who thought the Wii U was just some kind of add on and not a new system. The Wii U is in true HD, with HDMI out. It's also not dependent on the motion controls any more, so a lot more games make use of the pro controller, a lot like the older pro controller for the Wii minus the need to plug it into the remote. That being said most games allow you to pick your control type, so if you loved tilt controls in Mario Kart Wii you can still use them, like the pro controller you can use that too. I owned a Wii and I've had a Wii U for a little while now and I would say the quality of the games for the Wii U is much much higher. Mario Kart 8, Pikmin 3 and Super Smash Bros Wii U are, for my money, the best yet in their respective lines. Also the new games are outstanding, such as Hyrule Warriors and Captain Toad Treasure Tracker. The Wii U also introduces the ability to buy any game as a digital download, same day as the stores. Most big releases even get a midnight digital release! The Wii U interacts with the amiibos, that besides being awesome figures unlocks content in Nintendo games! The Wii U takes everything good about the Wii and makes it amazing!
Four if you have enough controllers.
It is backwards compatible with ALL Wii mote controllers (original and with Wii motion Plus), along with all the accessories for the Wii Mote (like classic controller Pro). It does not natively support GameCube controllers but with the new adapter (shown in E3 2014) it will support both wired and wireless GameCube controllers.
At this time only one gamepad is supported. Wii remotes can be used for additional players. Watch out for unscrupulous sellers like Sadpolar7 selling the "Deluxe Set" without the gamepad. The system needs the gamepad to work. SCAM!
yep
Yes, this is an official Nintendo product. However, please be aware that (as indicated by the picture) this is the Japanese model. As such, you'll notice the text on the box is in Japanese. I have not noticed any compatibility issues whatsoever. For that matter, the controller feels and responds exactly like my US version Pro controller. No discernible difference, other than the text on the back of the controller also being in Japanese.
Use this driver: http://www.wiinupro.com/ (If you have a bluetooth with the Toshiba Bluetooth Driver stack, like this one: http://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-V2-1-EDR-Nano-Adapter/dp/B0029L4BE4), or this adapter: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E6553PW.
Nope, Wii games played on the Wii U must be played with Wii controllers. You can pick up the Wii Classic Pro Controller and a Wii mote, but as for the Wii U Pro controller, that can only be used with compatible Wii U games.
It works perfectly fine with the NA console. Syncing the controller is very simple, its just pressing the sync button on the back of the game pad and the sync button on the Wii u console itself.
No. It has a built in battery that is charged via a USB cable that is included.
Yes with both games
Yes
Absolutely. It makes playing easier overall.
Ships from japan. You can choose the delivery method. STANDARD SHIPPING ( by Air ) - no tracking & not insured ( 10 - 28 business days). EXPEDITED SHIPPING( EMS )- tracking & insured ( 5 - 12 business days).
You have to have friends with you. How evere you can have one frind and both of you can bring a Shakalaka with you ether Cha-Cah or Kayamba with you and they are CPU- Controlled.
ABSOLUTELY!! The Circle Pad Pro means you don't have to use the touch pad to work the camera controls, so it makes the game 100 times easier to play. Just make sure that you have a 3DS that the Circle Pad Pro will fit because it will not fit a 3DS XL. (They made a Circle Pad Pro later on that would fit the XL, but I don't know if they still make it.)
To be honest, no. It's difficult, but difficult in a way that's often very rewarding for a player when the time and effort is put in to learn monster attack patterns and optimal attack strategies per weapon. There are guides all over the internet and on YouTube to help a new player out with these things; I recommend ProJared's Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate videos for help starting out, and then a good search of whatever weapons a new player wants to pick up to see them in action. My first night playing I knew nothing and it took several hours for my group to down our first big monster, but then I watched, listened and practiced and the next night we played I was fantastic, knew where to go, how to hit and was prepared for everything that could be thrown at us. It's not easy to play, but it feels really, really good when you start to master it.
Yes. All missions have a time limit. However you can go into Moga Woods for "free hunt" which is not timed and stay there as long as you'd like.
The 3DS version is only capable of playing locally with other 3ds or Wii U users. The Wii U version is capable of playing online. I hope this helps :)
The 3ds version can only play in lan and solo the online quests so in fact almost the entire game is offline!!
Yes
They both need 3ds systems. To my knowledge 3ds/2ds systems are backward compatible but a Nintendo DS can't run a 3ds game.
This game would be a bit difficult but if he has friends to play with (it's a great multiplayer game) it wont be too hard. There's no gore or gratuitous violence at all, so it's very appropriate for all ages in my opinion. I really love this game :)
No
Yes, however if you played the originals on console, a controller would be much more comfortable.
I actually think it's required. Not 100% sure on that, but I can confirm I use a controller with it.
I don't see why it wouldn't. I installed it a while ago when I bought it for Steam. Windows 8 has the same folder structure as Windows 7 and Vista, but only a different Start menu. There should be no reason this doesn't work.

It needs to be plugged in to the transmitter for it to work wirelessly This is not a Bluetooth device but it does work with the cord nicely. The receiver is USB 2.0 with a 3.5 mm male adapter if you want to plug your phone in to the wireless connection.
yup and they have about 30-40 feet before they lose signal.
Slightly over ear
Hey Juana, Now that you mentioned it, it looks like I might have placed this headset under the wrong product. The headset I am selling is actually the PDP Afterglow Kral PS4 Wireless Headset - not the Afterglow Universal Wireless Headset. I think the Afterglow Universal Wireless Headset can't be used with Playstation 4. I will place this listing under the correct product.
They work with our TV, sound system, PS4, XBOX, even the home computer. They work so well I got my brother his own for Christmas.
Go to the afterglow website and u can order a new one
Yes they do
I didn't pay quite this much and I don't know what you are comparing to. I'm pleased with their performance
Most of the reviews seem to say it does NOT work with PS4.
Long cord plugged in via usb

Hey Juana, Now that you mentioned it, it looks like I might have placed this headset under the wrong product. The headset I am selling is actually the PDP Afterglow Kral PS4 Wireless Headset - not the Afterglow Universal Wireless Headset. I think the Afterglow Universal Wireless Headset can't be used with Playstation 4. I will place this listing under the correct product.
They work with our TV, sound system, PS4, XBOX, even the home computer. They work so well I got my brother his own for Christmas.
Go to the afterglow website and u can order a new one
Yes they do
I didn't pay quite this much and I don't know what you are comparing to. I'm pleased with their performance
Most of the reviews seem to say it does NOT work with PS4.
Long cord plugged in via usb
Yes it does work on Windows 8.1. It does not come with a CD. You have to download an N64 emulator of your choice and then plug in your controller. Once the controller is plugged in and windows recognizes the controller, you can go into your key configurations under the settings in the emulator and edit the keys yourself. Some emulators do require you to manually enter each key one at a time. The product works amazingly. Bought 4 myself and have it all running on my PC.
No it does not. It feels lighter than the Nintendo 64 controller as well. Basically it is the Nintendo 64 controller shell and a circuitboard in the middle. I bought both the grey and black. Great purchase in my opinion.
Yes, though it really depends on what emulator you use. I use project 64 and it goes up to four. What emulator do you use?
I have had the same issue. Try either using a dab of superglue on the metal part where the joystick slides on, or for a less intrusive method, use a small piece of paper towel between the metal part and the joystick. Hopefully, part of the paper towel will get wedged between the metal stick and the inside of the joystick, strengthening the bond. Hope this helps.
As long as you have a USB 2.0 and you should be fine. Just when you go into the key bindings hit the button on the controller, I found it was as simple as that.
What emulator are you using? Did you put the mini DVD in your computer.
no
i don't know i use windows 7 xp and 8 but it comes with a software disk so try it the emulator i use is project 64 and they have updates as well sorry i do not know much about macs
Sure, all joysticks can be used as mouse device on Windows platform, this can be made with third-party software such as JoyToKey of Joystick-To-Mouse. Enjoy!
Because you have to go into your emulator settings and manually set the keys to the emulator. You can't expect your computer and a CD to do all of your work for you considering you are most likely trying to play games that are illegally obtained. Open your emulator and go to your controller settings and manually enter each key in. When you go to the settings it will display all the controls and what they are set to on your keyboard as this is a default universal controller to all computers.
Yes. The PS3 is "region free", however if you plan on buying any downloads for those games, you would have to buy them from the Japanese Playstation Store.
This Playstation has the sliding top disc tray instead of a disc slot.
Yes plays Blu ray and DVD and burn DVDs
Yes
Sorry friend, no backwards compstibility, I'm afraid. Use the PS store/Amazon to get your fix. PS1 digital downloads are cheap and there are HD remasters of old PS2 games available for the PS3. Happy gaming!
Transformers aren't needed, the PS3 has a universal PSU.
With analog TV is ok. Netflix, only suscribe credit card before to play app
This one does not. What sets this one apart from the one with two or three games is that this comes with 500 gigs of memory and the others come with much less.
Very good item
Netflix will be preinstalled, but you have to log in or make a new account. New accounts will get a 1 month free trial. Service is 8.99 a month for streaming video.
Yes It has the original firmware, But when you connect the console for the first time, begins to be updated
It did not have a manufacturer's warranty and even though it was listed as "new" my console was in "like new" status only. Very clean, works well. But no warranty. Though with sony's new system you can purchase an additional warranty these days for about 50$
Yes, it comes with one controller
Unfortunately you can't use PS2 games on the PS3. It would be a huge selling point if you could though!
couple lbs
Yes but only one
No its two discs. Its in sleeves like if you got a used game at gamestop. It dont cases
This product comes in the special edition box you see and the games come in small sleeves
I have pretty big hands and when i palm the mouse my fingers don't go past the side. It gives a nice, full feel when holding it.
Yes they can. In the settings you have an option to change the colors, the way it pulsates, and also just turning them off completely.
I believe it has omron switches. Not sure on the scaling, just sounds normal. Much like my old logitech g500. Based on your last statement, its probably not the clicking. Try screaming at the game more it will cover the mouse and fans.
lights in the Kone pure are on the logo itself not the sides, while in the XTD it's on the sides (4 LEDs) while the logo is a silversih color only, not lit up also you sacrifice one more button, the button infront of the scroll wheel, it counts as 2 buttons with the shift + functionality, other than that it's the aesthetic looks
Every once in a while the mouse will "wander" or "drift". It's correctable by unplugging it then re-plugging it in to the USB port. I've not noticed any problems specifically with the scroll wheel. I've also never mapped any of the other buttons, so I can't say how well they work.
I haven't had any issue of the sort and my friend who had to RMA his didn't have a problem during the procedure, either.
I got this for my husband, he has a large hand and it fits him great. Not sure of the G9's size though
Yes. You just need a USB port, which every computer does
There are two buttons right under the scroll wheel that were made with that in mind. They have '+' and '-' on them respectively, and are set to adjust DPI to whatever you like in the default setup. You can, however, change the function of the two to whatever else you can think of, so there is a lot of versatility.
It's kindof tough, but as any mouse requires a little breaking in.

Yes.
It should work.
Yes the game comes with a disc for dlc
yes.
One year
Included in the box is the mouse, base, and USB cable. To use the wireless function, plug the USB cable into your computer and into the back of the base. You then sync up the mouse to the base and your good to go. Be careful though. The base tends to be really picky about which USB port you plug it into.
You can most likely find a suitable one at Walmart. I know the one for this mouse has more of a squared and thinner end, so that's what you should look for. You can always buy a few different ones and return the ones that don't fit. Good luck.
It uses a built in battery, cant remove it, the base this mouse comes with also charges it, but battery should never really be an issue, the mouse also has an input hole, you can play while you charge.
I used one for 15 months or so.... never had wear problems at all. Really enjoyed the wired one. Not so much the wireless. I was disappointed with their support. Went to all Razer products. That said the wired version was excellent quality and is still on my shelf as a backup to my Razer Ouroboros.
Well I play usually 6 or 8 hours, then simply redock it in the charger. I've not left it undocked to know how long it lasts. I'm sorry!
Like rat 9. Put another battery in charger and we can change anytime.
It should work, but not effectively. There are 4 or so buttons that you use your thumb to click, though I suppose you could use your pinky to use them. But that's only if you plan on using it to game fully- I use mine as a regular mouse without using many of the extra buttons ;) So it depends on your intended use.
It will work with any computer with a usb port. That has windows xp or later. It will recognize the mouse but, you will have to go to the steelseries website and download mouse's program. To set the mouse functions for a specific game. I have mine set for diablo 2 and diablo 3. It has the option of working connected by wire or wireless.
Yeah Vita is region free. I played it on my US Vita. It's just the DLC you'll have to worry about. If you want that your Vita need to be using a japanese account to use the DLC.
The one I bought here was all Japanese, though I do know there is a American limited edition.
No.
if they aren't selling the region free one just go on play-asia and buy the game from there they have a region-free version there for sell.

It's a wired mouse.
No it doesn't. None of the extra buttons work, so you can only use it like a "regular" mouse. That didn't stop me from buying it though :)
No it does not. The wheel actually has firm 'clicking' as you spin the wheel.
Yes, I believe you can
In terms of plug and play yes, however I don't believe the software suite will be compatible with Mac.
Sure,Over 30 Midway classics on one disc in HD,they are as follows....(some of which haven't been included in previous Midway collections. Several games, including 720, Gauntlet and Marble Madness were made by Atari, so it's interesting to see them included in this collection.) Defender Gauntlet Joust Rampage Total Carnage 720 A.P.B. Arch Rivals Bubbles Championship Sprint Tournament Cyberball 2072 Defender II Gauntlet II Joust 2 Marble Madness Pit-Fighter Rampart Robotron 2084 Root Beer Tapper Satan's Hollow Sinistar Smash TV Spy Hunter Spy Hunter II Super Off Road Super Sprint Toobin' Vindicators Part II Wizard of Wor Xenophobe Xybots
Yes it does
I don't think so, in fact, it will get you closer to the feel of the original arcade games. Hope this helped.
Yeah its the arcade version
no
Nope...I was disappointed to
Im working now but first chance i will get back to you or bring the game up on google they may have the list of games on it there.
There should be a list of games in product info or on peoples' reviews. As far as I know it does NOT have Galaga.
Yes and its sooo awesome!
No
No. Only AC2 comes with DLC.
They are three separate game all around EZIO as the main character. All the games are on the disc but need to be downloaded as all the data could not fit on the disc. As long as you have space on your PS3 hard drive you will be fine.
This is the full trilogy on one disc
All come with the disc but the first two need to be fully installed (not from the Internet just from the disc) revalations is the only one that doesn't require a full install to play
They install from the disc, but you still have to have the disc inside the PS3 to play the games. All 3 games are on one disc, brotherhood is the only game that can be played straight from the disc.
Yes
As far as I know, yes. I bought this game used and I played all three games. Assassins creed 2 and brotherhood aren't actually downloads. They are on the disc but requires aa full install to play them.
I did not have to download any patches besides install ac2 and ac brotherhood, i would have to say no
Yes it does have uplay points im not sure ypu can earn it but when i was playing it would say i won this and that
It has both languages in it
Yes it works beautifully on my Windows 8 device! Some of the games (Red Alert 2 in this case) will refuse to open up once they are tabbed down but otherwise the games run well!
I have no idea...The one sent to me is in German...
Yes you can. Just log in to your Amazon account and re-download the game client. Very easy to do.. If you have the product key saved you can even do it from the orbit game console thing.
Work fine on mine though you can't ult tab or minimize or you won't be able to open it back up.
There are a few steps to follow, and this link may help, but I will tell you what I did (http://answers.ea.com/t5/Command-Conquer-The-Ultimate/Info-How-to-run-older-Command-amp-Conquer-titles-on-Windows-8-1/m-p/4236614#U4236614) 1. Open up your task manager and end all command and conquer games and processes 2. Open up your Origin client 3. In the upper left hand corner click on Origin and click on Application Settings 4. Uncheck "Enable Origin Game" (if it is grayed out, be sure you shut down all Command and Conquer games in the task manager) The link above will also give you some tips on getting it to run, but try what I typed out first as it fixed my issues. Also, if you alt-tab out of the game, you will not be able to get back in without shutting it down via your task manager.
Yes sir it is.
Yes it does, it works on all windows os's from 95 and up. Hope you buy it you'll love it.
Yes sure.
Not sure about mac, i have it running on windows 8. I have a hard copy of generals and that actually works fine, Amazon had a great deal on the package so i thought it would be great to have a digital back up of my favorite of the series but it wont load through origin. I haven't tried them all but Red Alert 3 plays fine through origin.
No it's Windows only and requires the software from origin.com, runs in a boot camp partition though!

I don't know the size comparison, but here it is next to a deck of playing cards - http://imgur.com/oB7hsuG
It should. The mouse has been out for a while the cooler master is a big company, i'm sure they would have updated their drivers if necessary. Mice usually don't need externally installed drivers to have basic functionality, so i don't think it would be a problem at all.
Nope. Just up down. It is a nice wheel though, for me at least. Of course there is a mouse 3 if you click down on it.
very
No, it does not have a free scroll wheel.
Each of the various DPI settings has a corresponding color. The LED is only completely turned off when the DPI is on the lowest setting, otherwise there is always a color.
When I first got the mouse, it was a "problem" and one that was really annoying, but after a while I changed the way I gripped this particular mouse . Keep in mind you can always set those buttons to do nothing via the included software if needed.
Its nice retail packaging. Nice and sturdy with no wear or discoloration.
This is directly from the box: 116.4 x 64.4 x 42 mm
By far in my opinion since my twin brother got the abyssus at the same time as I got the Drakonia I would say the Drakonia has much louder clicking. Not to say that it's a bad thing or anything, but it is louder. The only thing I like about the abyssus over the Drakonia is the material that the top of the mouse is made of. It has better grip for your hand, but in terms of functionality and ergonomics the drakonia wins hands down.
I ended up buying the gaming surface made by the same company but I tried it on a standard mouse pad. Works fine either way. I just bought theirs b/c it gave me a lot more real estate to work with.
Well Jellicoe, I have no clue if this Mouse will work on Mac because I don't use Mac. The only Mac I use is Mac and Cheese. I appologize for not being able to answer your question. Good Day
It is compatible with windows 8 for sure.I am not sure about mac...
Only if you are a man 360 no scoper
Cable Length is 150cm (4"9 ft)
There is good news and bad news. The bad news is I looked it up and what I found was don't insert the Mini CD into the slot. The good news is you don't need to instal the CD to use the keyboard. You only install I if you want to program the keys.
You could use it for some light word processing stuff; I've used it for a few short papers. Its relatively comfortable to type on but it really wasn't designed with that in mind, therefore the keys are very loud and have a slick plastic feel to them which can get annoying. If you're looking for a keyboard solely for word processing, I'd look elsewhere.
no idea what the max is, messed with it once, stopped at like 20 keys. so I think you are good, there just aren't any extra keys so use a key that you never would use.
It doesn't respond well to the dual modifier keys test about 60% work, but with a single modifier key and multiple normal keys including F keys it works fine not including the number pad. Modifier Keys + Z + XCVBNM&lt;&gt;?ASDFGHJKL:"}{POIUYTREWQ!@#$%^&*()_+| | F1-F12 Up Down Left Right Apps Right/Left Windows Alt Ctrl Modifier Keys + Many keys as I can hold down and type still works as well Normal char keys many as I can hold down and the rest of the keyboard works as long as it's the first keys are not modifiers. If you tell me what you need to work exactly I'll try it for you and even download the game if it's not giant like 20GB. I already I have a huge lib of mmorpg, fps, rhythm, and bullet hell. If your game is of that genre I most likely have it installed. As for the keyboard itself it's a bit banged up today, but still going strong and I've hit over the 10 million press mark alone on the Q W A S D E keys and over 8 on Up Down Left Right. What can I say I'm a gaming junkie and I've wore the rubber off lol. -Andrew
Only one led and it is blue
It is mac compatable. but i dont think the install cd will work seeing as it is an Exe, but i could be wrong
No
Not mechanical. Gaming keys are rubberized ove I was happy with it. No complaints other then wasd keys are a pain to type with so I leave em off. Long coord for usb. Suggest watching a YouTube video before purchasing. Hope you found out what you wanted any other questions feel free to reply. In class atm but nothing to do so not a bother lol. Have a good day.
Question1: Nope, but you can remove them and clean them if you like too with the key remember that it comes with and for question 2 yea it does remove. Have a nice one
probably off the sharkoon website or just get some third party keys. BTW, is this keyboard good? i just wanted to know because im starting to build my pc and i want a cheap, but good keyboard. Will this basically fit the standard needs of a regular keyboard and a keyboard to play some light games like minecraft, steam games, ect.? thanks i would love to know.
Yus
yes
Yes it comes in the retail box.
Rubber dome/membrane, you'll never find a mechanical keyboard that is under $55-60
Yes. It comes with both.
Yes
At the moment, the PlayStation 4 will only play PS4 games. Unless Ubisoft Montreal decides to make a PS4 version of this game, which is unlikely being that they are currently working on the production of newer Assassin's Creed titles, this game will only be playable on the PlayStation 3.
The one l bought came in a Clear Case not that Greatest Hits.
Mine came in the actual box.
Si, it has subtitles both in English and Spanish
NO.
Yes
Hate to break it to you but you won't find ezio or Altair in these games. There stories are done. But I would recommend you do not skip. Get this first than that so you will understand what's going on. However I would get brotherhood and revelations before this one so you know what's going on in 3
Unfortunately, it doesn't...just English as default language.
This works with all regions of the 3DS XL. In short yes.
yes it does, check your local gamestop though could they sld carry them now and cheaper.
If you try to use it as a grip, you might find it hard to hit the R button because the R button on the Circle Pad Pro is closer to your finger and is essentially useless. You can still reach the R button on the 3ds itself but you have to reach pretty far and might cramp your hand as a result. If you only want a grip, you're probably better off getting something different like a "Skque Controller Hand Grip Handle with Stand for Nintendo 3DS LL, Black" or a something similar.
No it will not as it won't fit properly on the new hardware. That "c stick" nub and the extra shoulder buttons takes the place of the Circle Pad Pro attachment and alleviate the need for it.
Some games have the option to have the circle pad, which in most cases, enhances your game play. Best example is Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate which helps with the camera movement.
Not that I know of. Usually games have an option for the circle pad pro in the control options (MGS 3 did), but Smash did not.
The circle pad pro is compatible with the Nintendo 3DS XL, also known as 3DS LL. 3DS system is not included with the circle pad pro
I haven't had any problems with scratching from either my circle pad pro or my one for the xl. Sometimes dust and stuff can get into the CPP if not used for a bit but dust it out and you should be fine.
No, this is not a 3DS (and it isn't marketed that way). It's a Nintendo peripheral that adds functionality (extra circle pad and two extra buttons; ZL and ZR) to a 3DS XL.
Frankly no. It adds nothing to it. The new 3ds has the two extra zl and zr buttons, and a c stick. If you want it for the ergonomic feel you can simply get a handle case.
Hey, I am not entirely sure what part of the game you are specifying so I will just try to answer it with the following information: There are 3 different camera angles in this game: there is an over the shoulder third person view; an isometric perspective/ dungeon crawler angle (games like Diablo 3); and then one thats just more of zoomed out 3rd person perspective. If you play with the over the shoulder third person view then you will be moving/strafing your character with WASD and your combat will be based on a combo of the keyboard (inventory/weapon/style selection) and mouse (mouse is used for aiming, and sword fighting because the game uses a mechanic where you click the mouse at specific times for the ideal swing). If you play with the isometric view then you can just use the mouse for movement and combat, with the keyboard being used for inventory, weapon, sword style selection. Hope that helps!
Both, The game has three modes for movement. Two use the mouse , one uses WSAD and the mouse to look around. Each is basically how you see things(Its all a third person view). You use the keyboard for quick actions or you can click through the HUD. Its a fun game. The Enhanced Edition comes with a lot of extras contained in its files.
The disc version may be( or available as a stand alone version). I bought the PC version steam code off of Amazon because they had it on sale. Steam does not have this in a Mac version.
I bought this black unit as a replacement for my original wii as I had heard stories of wii ending production. My original console does play the game cube discs and has ports for the game cube controllers. This new unit does not. I haven't tried the cube discs, but doubt they work without controller ports. Hope this helps.
Wii Sports consists of five separate sports games-tennis, baseball, bowling, golf, and boxing. Sports Resort consists of the following "resort" style games:Swordplay, Wake-boarding, Frisbee, Archery, Basketball, Table Tennis, Golf, Bowling, Power Cruising, Canoeing, Cycling, and Air Sports(Parachuting and Piloting). GameCube compatibility is limited to the first generation Wiis which include an earlier version of the Sports Resort bundle. Always read descriptions of items and ask sellers questions before purchasing. Hope this helps.
Yes, once you set up your Wi-Fi and get your Wii online, you can use Netflix or Amazon Instant Video directly from the options menu. Hope that helps.
Yes
Yes it does
Yes, you would need an HDMI cable to do that.
Yes. Bowling, table tennis, etc.
No Wii model has HDMI output. The Wii U, the next generation console that is not a Wii, has HDMI.
Yes there are games you can get that are the same as karaoke.
There are several here at Amazon. here is the ASIN# for original Nintendo replacement on Amazon: B00LEEVDXO. Copy and paste number in the search area and it will come up. Hope this helps! ;D
No, it's a psp 3000.
Yes, I can still play english games on this handheld. Only thing i noticed that was different was the controls on the main menu are different ( like to enter the game). Awesome looking system though. Would recommend getting a clear case to protect the system.
No. System and game are Japanese. System can be set to English, game cannot.
Sorry,this game is Japanese version.
yes.

It connects via audio ports, not USB. You should have no problems.
Besides one having red accents and the other blue, the headsets are completely identical. The difference is that the PLa includes additional cords that make it compatible with PS3 and PS4 gaming consoles. The same is true with the XLa, which has green accents and comes with extra cords needed to work with and Xbox 360.
foam
I have a headphone which is the same with the picture, Turtle beach ear force Zla game headset. I use this headphone to watch movie on computer that only has one jack. So I think this headset will be work by your demand.
yes and they are very nice
no, there is a 360 version of this headset though
yes, but there's not a lot of games that are compatable with the mouse. Possible soon with the new diablo 3.
No, we currently only ship within the continental USA.
Thanks for asking. We are sorry that we don't do international shipping.
If you haven't downloaded the firmware tool I would get that and get the latest firmware installed. I haven't had good luck with the steel series engine software....but you can run the mouse without that. My mouse misbehaves if I use the steelseries engine software.....may be a bug in the program or my system.
One of the best mice I have owned only problem I had was the nylon wrap on the cord came pinched as couldn't fix it and it can unfurled and had to cut it off but mouse functionality works super great
yes you can i have play with no problems and many other games great mouse.
Yes
No, you have to take it off before put in Energizer charging station. The Uboost changes the dimension of the gamepad...
No a case doesn't fit well with this. I was able to cut my silicone case enough so that it fit.
It gave it another three hours or so.
yes one charge. my only complaint is after almost a year I need to buy another the battery simply does not hold a charge any longer
Sorry to this man but it doesn't say. All I can tell you is that this battery is exceptional and can have you playing on your Wii U for over 15 hours if you can work it right. Its a real great find and I highly recommend it. I promise you won't be disappointed.
YES
Please send us a message. We can email a PDF copy to you. Thank you.
yes it does. but remember that this is not a jitter, so it will not make automatics faster, only make them slower. but single shots fire like lightning, on number 4 setting. pop pop pop goes my 57 on hc and does goes the whole team. :D
Yes
That's made by Lighting Modz for the Xbox 360 sold through Amazon. Go back to the AMAZON page you purchased it on. on the right side of the page it will ask for a rating. below the rating area is a contact section to contact the company. when you do make sure your e-mail address is noted. Explain your problem and ask them to email the instruction sheet. when you get the sheet make copies as the paper gets worn. It's a good product for the Xbox 360. They have one for the Xbox one but it's hard to get.
yes I currently use mines with advanced warfare to
No the mode 17 reprogramable is a bunch of different rapid fire options. just remember if you're playing call of duty they set a fire rate so if you set your mod too high it the gun will freeze.
Yes I'm using it as we speak GT: huge camper
It works, but it doesn't do much for Halo. The only difference is that you can hold the tigger for the weapons that you normally need to keep tapping the trigger.
There are 17 modes you can change.
Yes it does
The controller is reprogramable, so it can work with any game you set it to, but yes it has a mode for left for dead
I have not tried every feature of the controller, but the "Rapid Fire" does work with Titanfall.
Sorry Alexander we returned the controller because it did not do what they advertised. It was basically just like a regular controller. I hope that helps
It uses the sync button to change mods, to go back you hold right trigger and press sync
Idk, I dont have GTA 5. Sorry
Don't buy it, controller broke in less then 2 months. Sticks stopped working to move around. Couldn't get my money back.
It kind it does work would be old to buy a lags a lot and some of the features really don't work all that well it's kind of expensive control for what it does a good will be done better
This response is for the actual software shipped to you and NOT the download which *might* work differently. ~~ In previous years, I have used the software to file my own taxes and then passed it to a friend who also used it for her own taxes, including using the efile. (I never registered the product with H&R Block and she even has a different address than me.) I have not finished my taxes for this year yet, but if the previous years are any indication, then it *should* work again the same way. I find no indication that they have limited the e-files so that only ONE user can use them, i.e., nothing on the box or in the material says that.
Yes, it does.
Has 5 free Federal, no free State files. Can print and mail as many as you like. Russ O.
Yes, you can. See http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/100753/H-R-Block-At-Home-2012/ (only one of several ads and reviews that specifically state this).
$19.95 for each state e-file. No filing fee if you print it out and mail it.
Yes, provided you have the minimum system requirements as listed on the side of the box. Just insert the disk and it should self install from there.
Yes, Roth conversions are definitely supported at the form level. I started using Block 2012 as soon as the first download was available. A big reason was to estimate how much to convert this year. I don't recall that Roth conversion was in the original interview, but I'll check. Also, I bet that the forms are available in Turbo Tax too. Update, conversion is there in the interview too.
Schedule C, without a doudt. Unemploryment, any income. Annuities, I'm not 100% sure here, but would say 90% sure it will. It does 1099-d, any long or short stocks, so I see no reason annuities would be left out. FYI. All my Scottrade stuff downloaded into 2011.
According to the box, yes it will.
First, I received an e-mail from H&Block that said the IRS received my return. A little while later I received this one saying... "Congratulations! The IRS has accepted your federal return."
Yea
No not at all but still awesome
Yes, there is a cable that plugs into the headset, then plugs into the device that plugs into your pc/console. Or it can be plugged into a phone or mp3 player, etc. Its long but not too long, about the same length as most earbuds.
Plug the av cables into the TVs audio out and then plug the USB cable into the Xbox .PS its not wireless spend a couple of dollars more and buy the Plyer 2 scucandy
Kinda, you need to buy the adaptor from Microsoft. Then buy a cable for the audio input, which is around $5. But you'll experience issues such as adjusting the mic and volume. I personally won't recommend this for the xbox one. Just get the Skullcandy SLYR for xbox one..
No
No they only work on the 360 xbox . I have both and use both..
The Skullcandy SLYR is compatible with the XBox One. It has adapters specifically for it, in fact.
No.

with the stereo headset adapter with is not included
I have a ps4 not a One so im not sure but i would think yes
Yeah, you have to plug the headset to the controller. Just 1 wire that is about 6 feet long.
Yes, you plug one part of a mic control into your Xbox and then plug the included 2.5mm cable into your controller.
Yes that's what I do
It is pretty long. Around 6 to 8 feet
Till black Friday
If you are asking if it is able to be plugged into a phone to listen to music with, the answer is yes.
No, its a good set for its price range.
Yes but you need purchase adapters to make the audio sound better and like with any console boy a sound processor to enhance audio, the processor makes my skullcandy slayers sound smooth and crisp as well as my turtle beach ear force tangos. I would recommend the Dolby dss sound processor from turtle beach

To be honest, I'm not sure how the chat side works for the Wii U, but my assumption is that any headphone with a standard 3.5mm jack will plug in direct to the Wii U controller. You won't get surround sound or anything, but as a stereo headphone, it should work normally.
The band is pretty comfortable, as well as the ear cups. I wear this for hours, and I have average is not slightly large ears.
Nope!
I have a ps3, but for the price, you really can't beat them. The only problem with the headset is that it occasionally cuts off vocals and you have to disconnect and reconnect the wires. Other than that, the quality of both sound and vocals are very clear. Of mine ever die on me, I will most likely purchase the SLYRs again.
Unfortunately no. No way to mute except using the inline control or via console or pc
it goes into the controller.......
Wut
It will work with the Xbox One, but not right out of the box. You will need to buy the Xbox one adapter that will allow you to use it (I think the adapter goes for 25 dollars, I don't really remember what I paid for it.) The adapter allows any stereo headset to work so the SLYR works nice. You don't need to do anything but plug the headset straight into the xbox one adapter for headsets and you'll immediately get game sound to tell you that it is working. No more long cables running between you and the tv/xbox 360. The adapter even allows you to adjust game sound right from it by simply pressing the +/- controls. The other side has controls for game/person volume with a mute in the middle.
Yes I use mine with Xbox one but you need the adapter from xbox
Should work fine if you follow the install instructions that come with it

I have a 12 year old boy that loves this game. He's been playing is for a few years, upgrading each time he can. Sometimes children don't want to take the time to read the instructions, but they have an amazing way of figuring it out on the fly. That said, there are instructions if a child should get stuck, so don't let them give up too easily. If your child loves trains, has an imagination, and any sort of engineering or problem-solving skills, this is a good learning and fun game/software to buy for them.
Yes!
you do not need to be connected to steam to play after install. just tried it and was able to play. it will come up with a message saying it can not connect to steam and will give you a button to press "play game" click this and it will launch the game. Happy railing! :-)
Hi, I got mine through steam but here's a link to amazon where you can buy the disk. http://www.amazon.com/Tri-Synergy-12065-Train-Simulator/dp/B009S4JZKK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1407301847&sr=8-1&keywords=train+simulator+2013+pc hope link works.
I tried unsuccessfully to find the answer for you, even asking a few others. I googled "Train Simulator 2013 - Amtrak Acela" and found several youtube videos that talk about it. Maybe that will help you.
Yes it can run on Windows 8.1 However it will need to run on the Steam program which is free unless you desire to buy more engines and more tracks.
I believe you can, but not with the basic software. This product is part of Steam, which is an umbrella for this and many other PC games. I think the cost to do what you want is high. Check out Steam on the web, and contact them.
I enjoy playing the simulator, but there is a lot of problems I have ran into with both 2013 and also 2014 using Windows 8. Some of the games hang up or lock the computer. I also found that some the scenarios were very hard to complete because of time limit set is to short or the trains need more power in order to keep up the speed in the hills, or just shut down. Another thing. It would be great if they produced a manual to show and explain a lot of the operation. For a beginner like myself. Half the time I am lost and have no ideal of what to do next. Very costly to attempt to purchase add-on to enjoy more of the game.
I believe it does. Syetem requirements are on the box. Also the website "steam" has Q
Hi,David. The only difference between both models its that the essential version has no Green LED backlit keys and the Expert version its fully illuminated with the green backlit keys. If you like the design and the Chiclet style keys go for the Expert version.In my opinion this is a very good keyboard. Maybe at the begining it take some days to get used to it but soon or later you wont regret.This is very good keyboard for the price.
nope its only green
Yes
Not at all.
Everything OK !
the lighting on the keyboard is fully customisable, going from off to bright and everywhere in between.
I'm not sure,but I'm not having any problems like this other guy. Some places say it has scissor switches, but I haven't taken any keys off to check. It's a good keyboard IMO.
C = Caps Lock 1 = NumLock S = Scroll Lock I own the keyboard and love it! Perfect for me! xD
They keys measure 1/2 inch
Yup!
Its an audio jack input, not USB, so there is no reason why it wouldn't work on a mac. I use my set with both my PC and my iPod when I am at home, and have no issues.
The Audio does, the microphone requires a strange workaround for no particular reason. Razer support insists that it's "not compatible with the PS4" despite the product description "The Razer Kraken's 3.5mm combined audio jack is compatible with any device that accepts a 3.5mm input, allowing use across multiple devices.", but they also directed me to this customer-created workaround: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMiHbMWjF2E
No I dont it does. I believe its only for computer.
The headphones themselves should work perfectly fine with the 3ds. Not too sure if you'll be able to use the mic with them or not but the sound will come through them for sure
the mic on the headset is crazy sensitive no matter what you do, i for one on applications unlike skype that you can use a push to talk key would help...as far as voice activation applications such as skype, their isnt much you can do, lower the music volume separately from the voice application in order to get the right volume...
It sounds like you will have to go through Razer's warranty. I think they have a 1 year warranty. I would just go through Razer's official website. Unless you get some heavy duty headphones, most will break if not taken care of properly. I hang mine on a hook when I'm not using mine. Or, it could be a wiring issue when the headphones themselves aren't messed up, but maybe the wires did get messed up. To prevent this issue, I keep my wires twisty-tied together so they don't touch the floor. I've gone through extensive research on how to protect headphones because I've had a few that I've gone through and finally found that if you take good care in protecting them & making sure they're taken care of, you can prevent these damaging issues. But yes, try to redeem their warranty through their official Razer website.
With an adapter yes but you life would be easier withhttp://www.razerzone.com/gaming-audio/razer-tiamat-71 or http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-audio/razer-carcharias-for-xbox-pc but there not as good quality wise
No. It comes with a Aux to Audio/ Mic cable. So you can plug it into a laptop ( Build in AUX cable) and use it or plug it into your desktop ( Splitter, AUX to Audio/mic cable).
You get a splitter for mic and sound
Yes you can
If you have a skylanders spyro game portal only series 1 characters work on it. If you have a skylanders giants portal all Giants characters, plus any new series2 plus all series 1characters will work on it.
The game can be played on the Wii, as well as other gaming consoles. If your going to buy the starter pack, the one with the actual game, be sure you purchase the right one for the Wii. The figures themselves are not exclusive to any gaming console.
I only bought them as a collectors item.
Hello. There is no straight forward answer to this question as its a personal choice. Just be sure what skylanders game he has. There are four games now and each game has different characters for it.
Yes
with the exclusion of Spyro's adventure, yes
They are 3 legendary skylander figures that can be played with on the actual game. The game is only in the starter packs which is for all systems. I assume it was $400 because of greed & rarity as people on this site occasionally do that. If it's just over $30 then good the price dropped drastically. Smart move on the seller's part.

Where the phrase Skylanders giants is on the package. For the "Giant" characters the name "Skylanders Giants" is towards the bottom of the package on the plastic. While on the smaller packages it's on the cardboard backing above the figure.
Yes I believe so. I purchased all of the Skylanders Giants only for my son to play on the Wii. Hopes this helps.
Yes. You will need to buy the Skylanders Giants or SwapForce starter kit for the 3DS, and you will be able to use all your Giants action figures.
Yes the main idea to follow is they all are backwards compatible so any giant is compatible and if you want to research this more look at the SCL web page or Facebook page it has all your questions answered there.

Well im in Costa rica and the game runs flawless maybe in Asia or..i dont think so actually ... this game was a worldwide hit so it probabbly is region free , this is definitely a great deal
Bio:plasmids pack,Challenge rooms pack,Bonus museum level Bio2:Sinclair solutions tester,Rapture metro,Kill'em kindly,The protector trials,Minervas den, collectible stickers (3)
It is a four disc set with Bioshock, and Add-on Discs plus Bioshock 2 and add on discs I bought the game used and the content loaded. As long as it is on a disc my understanding is that you insert the add-on disc and it will download the content onto your save file. The collectible stickers were missing, however. Thank you for your interest. Vernon Ritchie.
YES YES YES VERY MUCH
Yes it is.
To be honest I have beat this game on and honestly this has a lot of new content on the 2nd disk for both games & it's all good entertainment
The bonus content is on included discs.
I'm not completely sure but if it is playing on Xbox 360 I don't see why it wouldn't work
It does, its full english or full spanish... is Spain spanish tho' not latin american spanish. Not bad I actually like the voices
There really has no sexual content. It does have alot of violence.

It's on the other side of the cow shed.
Not sure, if don't have animals. Have you had animals and sold them? If you continue to have the problem, re-install and try again.l
They came out with farming simulator 2015 which is a lot better. I think once he knows the controls he's in good shape. For games like this, you would need a good processor and graphics cards so the game in simple terms is not choppy, blurry etc. Hope this helps,
I'm sorry, but can't answer your question. I can't even play mine. It says I have to make an account and when I do, it offers me other games to buy. I just want to play the game I already bought and can't!! I contacted them but got no help. I hope you have better luck getting the answer you need!!!
Yes, you need Steam to install Farming Simulator 2013 whether you download it from the Internet or from a disk. But you don't need Steam to play Farming Simulator 2013. Steam is the name of a website.
Ok, if you have downloaded them, you have to copy the file (right click, copy) then go go your documents-my games-fs2013-mods, then paste the file in there and it should work
that is a mod.

Shipping and Handling is the amount a seller charges you on top of the price of the item in order to ship the item to you. Some categories on Amazon have shipping and handling set by Amazon automatically (sellers can't change those).
Yes it will i have windows 8 and it work fine
yes but not as good
You are able to play but you both have to have the game. Then you could use email battles or real time versus online.
yes no issues with windows 8
I can't say; I have Windows 7.
No windows, buy the $19 get all games, also windows
The don't have Linux support and Steam key

the giants will not work in Spryro's Advanture. If that's what you are asking.
Yes, they will all work with swap force.
These Skylanders work on ALL gaming systems as long as you have the portal and game for that system. The only thing you have to do with this guy is, "Be afraid of the bark!!" That's his catch phrase. You should see my five year old daughter jump up, pose and yell it with him when he says it. So fun!!
Yes this is the Red one :)
My children tell me that all of the sky landers will work on the Xbox 360 also.
No this is just the figurine that comes with the game
Not in the original package. Usually tree Rex comes in a pack. When sold separately after coming in a pack he is "loose".
No. This is answer is coming from my 7 year old son. I cannot confirm it.
Yes it can

Yes this is the Red one :)
My children tell me that all of the sky landers will work on the Xbox 360 also.
No this is just the figurine that comes with the game
Not in the original package. Usually tree Rex comes in a pack. When sold separately after coming in a pack he is "loose".
No. This is answer is coming from my 7 year old son. I cannot confirm it.
Yes it can
yes
the giants will not work in Spryro's Advanture. If that's what you are asking.
Yes, they will all work with swap force.

Yes, the key caps pop off easily enough, without damage, to swap the Y and the Z for the German QWERTZ layout. The region keyboard settings however are built into Windows itself. For Windows 7 Users - Region and Language - Keyboards and Languages - Change Keyboard - General - Installed Services - Add - German (Germany) - Keyboard - Germany (Check Box) - Click OK twice
No, it is the membrane keyboard
No, it does not have a mic, but it has a mic plug-in port, and it has an microphone app on the eye where you can control the volume.
Hello, The language version on this keyboard can be changed to Spanish. However a Spanish version of the keyboard is not available.
Might want to make sure you have the most up to date drivers, turn off everything and unplug all of the cables on the keyboard and make sure the ports are clean(use some air duster or whatever) . Or could try reinstalling the drivers and software. Hope that helps! If not you might have a faulty one on your hands.. But that would be surprising.
I Would say a little clicky it's not annoying loud like when you hear it in an office
Yes
Yes, but considering how much of a pain it was to install the drivers to make the monitor for this device work on my own computer, your better off spending the same amount of money on a better keyboard. It does look great though.
No, and a ton of wires!
I use it with Windows 7 with excellent response. I do not know about Win. 8.
Yes, it runs on DS, DSi, DSi XL, 3DS, 3DS XL, and 2DS.
It worked with my Dsi Xl.
surprisingly i got mine from a friend who had it for about 6 months and i've had it over a year now and it still works but i have the old ds one
Hey, it's should. I never got mine but the game slot is the same size in the 3Ds and XL.
As far as I know...unfortunately no, you need the actual game cartridge in order for it to work.
Lets not confuse AR Cards with this device they are both two different items but to answer your question that has nothing to do with this AR, those cards are not needed on used 3DS units you can go to http://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/618/~/how-to-download-replacement-ar-cards-and-booklet to download replacement AR Cards from Nintendo Inc.
Absolutely does, that's what I have is a ds lite, and it works like a charm :)
I'm afraid it doesn't. Datel was planning to release a software compatible with MAC but they canceled it for some reason.
All you have to do is place the game inside the action replay and select your codes for the supported game
Yes it works on DS DSi & DS Lite all 3 connect to the internet the same way to use this product but you have to get a hold of the manufacture for the computer App to download
Yes. Xp and Windows 7 handle it just fine.
It's 6 feet with a really nice usb, I loved it and you will too :)
It's Wired.
It's relatively quiet. It's not a mechanical keyboard so it's not that loud. It's average I'd say.
As i can see you can press 6 keys at the same time
no
No it does not.
Yes it does. It doesn't tilt up a lot but its better than flat.
I am using it now. I had to take it from my desktop to my laptop to try it. I am using Windows 8 with the 8.1 upgrade. The keyboard seems to work fine on my laptop. I like the blue-lighted feature. You can dim the lights or make them brighter. I think you would be very happy with it. I hope this answered your questions. Now, I have to go plug it into my other desktop.
The one I received has three colors, blue red, and purple. Changeable by pressing the fn key and the number pad 5.
I bought one for my son in January. Yes, it comes with the sensor bar and blue one wiimote and nunchuck.
i think for 1 yr but not sure we have had ours for a couple of yrs and it is just fine.
The Wii is the console that would be connected to a TV. The WiiU is the handheld device. Similar to the PSP or the NintendoDS.
Two
Yes
yes, this bundle include wii remote plus. so you no need buy extend motion plus device
Yes you can watch netflix and amazon instant video through your wifi internet. There are some other apps such as weather channel and nintendo shop as well. If you are getting this for that it is great but they are discontinuing making regular wii games now which means you will only be able to buy used games or what wii games they have left in store, no up to date games. The Wii U is the new system that also plays wii games and wii u games. The wii U is also expensive. I bought the wii skylanders giant pack for my 5 year old and he loves it, we find regular wii games at yard sales all the time cheap or at gamestop. Maybe when he is older I will buy him a more expensive game system but not while he is so young.
Yes, this plays all Wii games. It has the console, antenna, controller and nunchuck. This one also includes the skylander's start up figures and the game. The blue color is specific for this skylander bundle.
yes i think so
no it doesnt, to both

Their brightness can be adjusted, so they can be, but if you don't like them to be that harsh, they can be adjusted to be dimmer. Hope this helps!
play puse, stop, FF, FB and volume keys so yes
yes, return it
The k70 is a great buy for most all. The build quality of both the TK and the K70 are pretty close but K70 takes the pot. Your options on the k70 are huge brown, blue, and red switches coming in with either black aluminum or silver; n-key roll over easy-Access Dedicated Multimedia Controls etc. The K70 is sleek and professional looking to the point you can take it to work and use it there. Now, the CM Storm QuickFire TK is minimalistic you get what you get and thats it. Not talking down on the product, the product is great. When put side by side with the K70 though, the K70 is the clear choice. For all the options and great features its hard to go wrong with K70. Plus,(depending on what key switch you're getting) you're not spending that much more, but in the end you know where that little extra is going. To answer your Question: K70 is your choice.
No
About 5 feet long
A key puller is supplied with the keyboard.
If you have the right software sure.
The latter, it sends the "0" digit twice. Not sure how useful this is for you but I rarely use it.
Yes
The number pad and arrow/home keys are integrated together. You switch between the number keys and arrow keys with the number lock key. So if you want to use the number pad you hit the number lock key which turns off the arrow/home keys and vise-versa. Makes a full size keyboard more of a ten keyless size which I like.
A "brown" switch refers to the style of mechanical switch used for the keys. The color of the lighting and keyboard aren't brown. This site here: http://www.keyboardco.com/blog/index.php/2012/12/an-introduction-to-cherry-mx-mechanical-switches/ offers a pretty decent guide to what different types of mechanical switches are and do. The key lighting is still white, and the keyboard itself is still black.
The Brown switched Quickfire TK in the US comes out mid March...I ordered this exact item and they just sent me a blue switched quickfire TK... ugh the frustration.
There are several levels of brightness. The function keys at the top let you cycle through the different levels.
It plugs in via USB, yes.
It should work as a basic keyboard but I don't think the media keys/shortcuts will work
No problems with mine -yet-!
Yes, the keycaps can be easily swapped out with the included keycap removal tool--but it's worth noting that you will have a hard time customizing the bottom row. While most mechanical keyboards have R1 modifier keys (bottom row keys CTRL, SUPER, META, and ALT) that are all 1.25 size-or 1.25 times the width of a standard letter key-and a 6.25 spacebar, the CM Storm QuickFire TK has unconventional sizes for most of them: From left to right, the bottom row sizes on the TK are 1.5 / 1 / 1.25 / 6.5 / 1.25 / 1 / 1 / 1.5. The 1.25's can be easily swapped as they're the standard size, and the 1's can be replaced with any custom printed "ZXCV" key. The 1.5's are trickier: A reprinted Tab key would be the correct width, but as it's much higher up on the keyboard (R3) it won't have the same profile as the other (R1) keys to which it's adjacent. The real problem is the 6.5 spacebar, which is practically unheard of. Only one other keyboard has done it (the Corsair K70), so swapping in a custom version may ultimately prove impossible. Of course, this is all only relevant if you plan on customizing the bottom row--there's nothing inherently wrong with the layout, it simply has non-standard keycap sizes.
Yes it does, it is a great buy. Hope this helps
Yes. You can toggle the light settings by using the function key on your keyboard with f4.
Yes it does
I honestly don't know. Whey I tried getting online it kept saying I needed to pay something and that I couldn't redeem the code, they may have disabled the online server but idk.
Yes
The level of play depends on the level you set it and the amount of control you wish take over your player also as you progress through a carrier the game becomes more challenging as you move up
Yes
Yeah you can play online against/with other players.
If he likes baseball and baseball video games then he will love MLB The Show. There are ways to make it easier for beginners or younger players to play via in game options.
you need, press the select button and then you can go into inbox, anything you can ask me again. ; )
It sounds like you should go into "Pitching" settings and check out your options there. You should be able to turn "Balk" off.
Yes. Though I wish there was more detailed scouting reports of pitchers from other organzations in RTTS.

It does indeed.
If your play by yourself you fine but if you play with a friend with co op play then it might be to Good with the angle if so I would recommend the 19 inch vanguard.
Not at all
yes it would.
My son uses his wireless controller on the XBox 360; don't know about other wireless devices.
Yes, the Xbox wasn't designed with mobility in mind. unless you set up a custom suspension for everything the disk will get scratched hitting a bump on the road this happened to me.
The Xbox 360 fits but its tight.
I honestly wouldn't. It would take a lot of the battery from the car. And/or not get enough to run the system properly which I'll cause shortages soon after or start to run hot because it's pushing itself harder. To go on the safe route go to a truck stop and get a car port that is a wall adapter. I would think you would be ok for the simple fact that it's a portable gaming device but at the same time. If I was meant for a car it would of came with a car charger. Good luck
Yes. my son traveled with his system in this case regularly.
Yes it is !
It sure will. I have used the following on it: 1. The Wii-U Tablet. 2. Original Launch Wii Remote 3. Wii Remote with built in Motion+ 4. 3rd party Wii remote with built in Motion+ As long as the battery compartment is in the standard location on the back it works fine. You just put in the energizer battery, and it lines up and charges. If you for example had a Motion+ add-on on the controller, you would have to remove it to allow the remote to sit properly in the charging dock though.
My kids do sometimes, because they have some regular Wii games they play that only use the remotes, and it has been on while they are playing. It doesn't seem to affect it.
This comes with its own charger cord, so if your original cord is damaged you can use this to replace it. However, it won't plug into the Gamepad directly, it'll only plug in to the cradle. So you still won't be able to play games on the Gamepad while it's plugged in unless you get a replacement from Nintendo.
Honestly i do not know if you can buy extra battery packs for additional wii motes. I would say contact the seller either online or on the phone and ask. Worst thing they can say is no.
No
Yes it does
Indubitably
seems unlikely, have you emailed energizer?
Ya it will sit and charge just fine.. i was the same way thinking it wouldnt and gave it a shot and worked out good and this charges the pad super fast i love it
No. Even though it supports it you can play it with just a regular controller.
Yes it does
It is a physical copy with a disk coming in it (a code is also included at the back cover of the game cover, although I'm not sure whether it has expired yet).
Yes it will.
Hello konnichiwa! This is first print version! I can not sent picture. Because Stock is located in the Amazon warehouse.
Not really. It's the Chinese version but the Chinese version is completely in English. So basically this is just the disc version of what's on the Playstation store.
I think the menu's are in english as well. I can't read kanji so otherwise I wouldnt have known where to start the game if it was in kanji
Yellow best, amigo.
it does have DLC but only if you have a Japanese PSN account.
I think so. thank you for your question

the battery pack looks so much like a xbox controler it may even interchange with one. my only problem is the ps3 thinks the batteries are dead at about half way and i get that popup, also the display with the battery level is NOT reliable, that way you have to go till the controler shuts off to get the fullest out of the battery. that being said this is a great controler i dont know why the reviews are so bad.
Yes I am I haven't been able to fix the problem either
yes it is true there is a lag. now whether it is the lag natural concurring with wireless and the amount of stuff a company has to put into that small space that cutting corners happens, or occurring because of the device mechanics itself i wasted no time in selling my controller. please note i gave a honest and clean review and Datel refused to post it and blankly told me neither to speak of their products. one may suggest honesty is not their policy. you can clean it with 91% or higher rubbing alcohol and a q-tip. or walk away.
No, the USB port is just to program the controller using a PC.
Works great on mac. However the configuration program doesn't run on Mac, so if you want to change the settings for the mouse you have to do it on a PC. The mouse remembers the settings after you set them, so you only have to do this once.
It does not click, but the wheel has enough resistance that it doesn't move around too wildly.
it felt a bit cheap when it isn't loaded with weights, but then again i like heavy mice. The plastic i feel should be less glossy and more of a matte finish. The heat from a persons hand tends to make it feel sticky over time and I'm constantly readjusting so there's a bit more glide between mouse movements. The material on top of the mouse would be a better replacement to the plastic right palm side. The mouse wheel feels a bit odd and stiff to scroll, but i believe it'll go away once it's more broken in. The mouse is pretty nice and is wide enough that my hand can comfortably hold it. I still need some further time with it though to see how it is in the long run of gaming. Still it is a pretty nice mouse though for the price.
Oh yeah. I use it every day at work because I use a lot of shortcut keys and since there are 9 on the mouse that you can make whatever you want, it works great!
the mouse wheel clicks but only down not left and right.
6 feet long.
No it does not.
For some reason I got an email of this question, I bought the 4000 dpi version and you can't set it like you asked. I did read the 4000 has less options in the software that comes with it compared to the more expensive higher dpi versions. Probably doesn't help but the best I can do.
Great overall mouse that easily compares to others 3-4x its price.
From my palm to my index finger is about 6 1/2 inches. I can rest my hand on the mouse with the heel of my palm on the table and my index and middle finger rest comfortably on the 2 mouse buttons. This still allows my thumb to manipulate he three buttons at the thumb rest too.

Yes this works with the Shield Tablet. I've used this and 90% of the time it worked flawlessly, occasionally, when connecting a bluetooth keyboard such as the Logitech K810 they would interfere with each other and cause stuttering. Disconnecting and reconnecting the keyboard would usually solve this issue. You can play games and operate the tablet with this though.
Yes. You will need to update the software but I do not notice a performance or functionality difference. It works very well.
No, you cannot tilt the mouse wheel. There are two buttons on each side of the mouse, as well as mouse wheel click and scroll, and the normal left/right clicks. All are customizable in Synapse.
Yes it works great with my current Mac book pro and Mac Pro both new this year.
Increased DPI, color changed to green, battery life doubled with the use of the newer bluetooth standard.
No, the USB cable is use for data purposes only and is not directly connected to the battery so it can't charge it.
yes, it is 2013 version
It won't allow you to adjust the settings unless you have the software installed. The settings are synced from the "cloud", so whenever the computer boots up and it is set to run on startup, it will gather any settings which may have been adjusted on another computer that has the same account on it.
Well I'm not sure, I use mine with a MacBook Pro so I have built in Bluetooth. But I would imagine you would open the Bluetooth settings or where ever you can see what is paired and hold down the four edge buttons and wait for it to show up.
Yes it hug the controller just much sure you put it on tight so you don't get air bubbles.( they're super aggravating)
No
No it is a separate feature you would have to purchase in addition to the controller. It comes in handy for a little while but eventually the material deteriorates after sometime. Still pretty cool item overall
No my friend it wont fit because is not design for Xbox one!
Depends on your play style if your like me and you hold your controller tight and your hands sweat causing you to lose. grip. Then yea they're perfect but if u hold you hold your controller lose and you sweat heavy then no because they grip your hand to tight and you do react slower than usual
I do not have docking station, but could not attach my keypad with it on. Also, within a week the grips on both controllers had started peeling off and would not stick down again.
Truthfully yes it does help with sweaty palms. As of right now I'm trying a full run of the entire mass effect series and it has seriously helped me keeping a good grip on the controller. Don't get me wrong, your palms will still get warm. But not to the point of slippage.
I've had mine since April of 2013 and it as only just now started to peel the outer textured cover off. The padding is still intact. If I can get the padding off, I 'll buy another set for it.
Sorry I got it for my grandson. Did you try googleing it. I'm sure you can find it online
I don't believe you can get a digtal one, but if you need one give me your email and I can type one out for you an send I your email.
It worked great on ghost and mwf 3 just watch some of the program videos that are on YouTube and you be ready to go
Aim bot is for Zombies only.
there should have been a white sheet of paper in the box with codes on it
Yes . I used x12 on mine. And it was excellent. Don't run tactical setup if you want to drop sho . It won't wor . Run default.
No it works for bo2 and bo1 and IG should work for mw2 and mw3. Hope this helps
Yes send me number and I'll send u a screen shot of it
If your saying if it comes with a HDMI cable, then no. If your saying can you hook one up to the system, then yes.
Yes, the version I purchased has both( Slim). I had some little difficulty setting up the wireless network( It isn't that hard, I just didn't know what I was doing). I also established a Bluetooth connection with a Bluetooth keyboard( It was relatively easy.)------ FYI, not backwards compatible with Ps2 games :(
When you say charging, I'm assuming you mean the dualshock 3, and yes you can definitely play and charge it at the same time. Ps3 wireless controllers, whether 3rd party or not, all have a port for the charger. Essentially that cable goes from the USB port of the PS3, to the controller. And lastly, nope, you don't need an HDMI cord to play, you can play with an AV cord, but you won't get good video quality. If you want to buy an HDMI cord for a super cheap price, check around online. I bought mine for 5 dollars.
No it did not. It only had one controller and the console box. No games or cords were in the box. I thought they might come in another shipment, but they never did.
Yup :)
This isn't the original Sony PS3 system that was released in 2006. It is second re-designed PS3 model, but it does come with wifi, Netflix capability, and other functions the first re-designed model have.
I'm not certain. You should call a support line Sony may have or a customer service number they may have.
Slimmer, Lighter and a Slide To the side of the Slot where the CD Goes.
Mine did but it might depend on who is selling the system.
256 mb system and 256 mb video. It's plenty for the simple task of running one game. I haven't experienced problems with streaming, videos, games or anything else. I hope this answers your query.
We sell this bundle with the game. If you want the system only, you would have to ask each seller if that's what they have. However, the price would probably the same or slightly higher as ours.
The newer console
Sorry, I purchased this for my daughter and not sure what works with it. I hope someone else knows. Sweetpea
I think so you will need a different control for the game cube
Yes
yes, we use it on our hdmi tv
The only updated item is that you get the newer Wii Remote Plus controllers. These controllers are so much more comfortable to hold when playing games. You get only one Wii Remote Plus & one Nunchuck.
110
There is no game cube ports included on this unit, because this item is the newest version.
There is no additional game included in this newest version. This WII is not gamecube compatible.
This is the full game, a demo is available at their website WWW. Eurotrucksimulator. Com
Not in the standard game. It does cover pretty much all of the Isle of Britain. Wish it did include Ireland and I really don't know why they left that out since you have the option of taking the chunnel or a ferry ride to the UK to deliver loads from mainland Europe. I know there is one expansion but I think that adds in some cities/countries in eastern Europe. Shame really that Ireland is not in the game. Course, it is possible that game mods may exist that add it.
No, you can buy it here and click download later. Then, you can go to "Your Games and Software Library" and the key should be there. You can redeem that key through Steam.
Is better if u buy in staem buy it in www.staem.com
Yep, it has no problems with windows 8/8.1
Absolutely, I run it just fine on Win 7.
yes, this works very well with windows 8
Yes
After you purchase it will start to download.
Yes, I use an Xbox One controller and am almost certain that you can use an Xbox 360 controller as well.

It is NOT a mechanical keyboard. However, I can tell you that I have been hardcore PC gaming for 18years and I am very satisfied with the way it feels. If you must have mechanical, wait for their new RYOS series keyboards to come out.
American here. I ordered this keyboard. Here's what mine looks like (pardon the smudges): http://i.imgur.com/Mn6qVwI.jpg
It has a caps key but I hate it. Its flimsy keys are cheap feeling and the caps lock does not have a gap between it and the letters, making it hard to not accidentally press, which happens alot...which is why im considering a new keyboard to replace due to this horrible design flaw...
no
Roccat only has Windows drivers and Linux drivers. There are currently no Mac drivers for it. I know that Razer has Mac drivers for many of their keyboards and mice.
Always blue, drives me crazy!

It works with Skylanders Spyro's Adventure, and Skylanders Swap Force. It also works with Skylanders Giants but be careful because it only works with the Wii Version and not the Wii U Version (if the disc case is Blue it's the wrong version) All of the toys and all of the portals will work. The only thing to be cautious of is to make sure you have the Wii version of the game and not the Wii U version.
Yes, it's functional w/ all existing Wii accessories and software.
No, wish it did.
Mario Kart
Yes. Use ours all the time.
The wii mini has no internet connection, it's just for playing games. It uses the original Wii games, not the new Wii U games.
The game system comes with one remote, so yes you will need to purchase additional remotes.
Yes, regular Wii games will work on this nice console. But Wii U games won't work.
Yes, you can use use the same controller.
There isn't one, at least mine didn't come with one either. Sadly, those days of the good ol' 30 page NES manuals are long gone.
idon't play online to many smucks..but it's 60.00 a year for online for xbox...you can also get 3 months or 6 i beleive
There is a main hub that people you meet along your journey will also travel to and you can fast travel there from any bonfire you have lit to trade or level up.
No
You can decide to have it region lock or worldwide in the in-game settings.
I would say no because the Xbox One is not backwards compatible.
Yes. You pick gender, hair, features and build.
Yes.It does.
Yes. It will require an Xbox live gold subscription.
Well, there really isn't much mature content in the game at all. Very minor coarse language, no smoking/drinking, no sexual themes. There's violence, sure, but no excessive gore or blood.
Yes, absolutely. Play it on the easiest difficulty your first time through as you learn the mechanics (normal, classic) and dont be afraid to look up any questions online. I had never played an FE game before and I loved it.
Yes, it's called Casual Mode, and you can choose whether to play through the game with it or not.
There's a couple things that I feel really help it stand out. For starters there's the relationship system that's in place - which not only gives better bonuses when people with higher relationships are next to one another, but it also unlocks conversations between party members that can be insightful, and entertaining. (I love character development, personally). Relationships that reach an S status can also result in 2nd and 3rd generations entering into the game. Don't fret! this is handled well, and plays in line with some of the other options of the game. It's not as forced as it may sound on the surface. Secondly are the reeking boxes and maps you can download. The boxes are ingame items purchased with ingame currency and let you create random battles to help level up your army and build relationships. These things are invaluable. The maps you can purchase are a lot of fun, and often give you boosts in income or experience, but they don't impact the game itself - you're not missing out on important game stuff if you skip buying these. Lastly, the option of playing casual or old school is nice. Casual removes the finality of death, and it's a great option when you just feel like relaxing and enjoying the story. Old School is great because it's nice to be able to play the game as intended. You can play either of these options on easy or hard settings on top of it all. There's a little more to it than that, but those are the things that I feel stand apart from previous versions. I've gotten pretty deep into the game, and I really can't find anything to complain about so far. I'm enjoying building relationships, and the story is interesting, and the game play smooth. If you've enjoyed past Fire Emblems, chances are high you'll enjoy this one.
I would say it's US locked. I live in the US and it works fine on my system.
Correct U.S game requires a U.S game boy
you can only transfer your "avatar" character to use on other files, but you need to "recruit" him by paying a considerable ammount of gold. Besides that, no, you need to start every difficulty from scratch. thats part of the experience though if you ask me.
I would not recommend it. It is quite violent and can be sexually suggestive at times. You could look into another series i play which is Rune Factory.
When I got it, there was no poster. There was only the game box with instructions and the game itself.
No. It is region locked to NA Nintendo is well know for this.
This game is for the US version of the 3DS
It registers as a pro controller,and yes it is wireless.
Kristin nailed it. Its for the Wii U only. It won't act like a classic controller
The right thumbstick is offset like the Xbox Controller, which makes it a more comfortable controller IMO. It's also cheaper. However, I've had 3 of these and the left thumbstick lost tension on all of them after 3 months of moderate use. You can find the Japanese import of the official Wii U controller for $39 on here. I would suggest buying the more reliable controller.
The buttons are pretty clicky but the analog sticks do have some dead zone. It's not so much that it gets really annoying but just enough to notice.
For me is very long lasting work more time versus wii u remote
It does not. Any game that requires the use of the gamepad will not work with the Pro Commander alone. But that often means you have to just use the Wii U Gamepad to power a game on, and then you can use the Pro Commander. Speaking from personal experience, Mario Kart works great with just the PC, but New Super Mario Bros needs a Gamepad to boot.
It's supposed to be awesome for Smash. That is the reason my son asked for this controller. 1st Item I purchase did not keep a charge. So I had to send it back. I reordered a new one.
Yes, it is actually really good for super smash.
A red light appears when it's charging.when it's done it goes away.Your controller should be able to work wireless if it doesn't then it's defective.
I doubt it the buttons on it are pretty crappy. You have to push them very hard to get them to register. Didn't play smash with it but it was pretty bad for mario kart.
Yes, you'll have to create an account, or use a previous one. If you dint have stream downloaded, during installation of shogun 2 out will ask you to download it for you. Hope this helps.
It can be 1 per turn depending on how upgraded the castle and province is. Generally ashigaru (commoners with weapons) units are recruited quickly. (1 turn = 1 season) More skilled units (Samurai, Kisho Ninja, Warrior Monks) will take longer 2-4 turns.
I have windows 8 and it runs perfectly for me.
It came with multiple install disks. One for Shogun 2, and another for the expansion sets.
You can play offline to with ou no problem, online online if you want to play multiplayer
idk but i comes with rise and fall of the samurais and that is it
I look into the resources of the disc and just bring manuals in English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian. Sorry but I dont see any chinesse, but you know what maybe when you installed trough steam they give you another lenguage option because that game is WOW
Yeah the one I got came with original case and game with everything in it like instructions and the product key.
it works on windows 8 tried it myself
You can install from disk and then activat through Steam or I just pulled the codes out of the box and loaded the latest version from steam. Either way the discs are basically placeholders
Just cut and paste. It has no capabilities to do surround sound. All it has is a analog left and right RCA input jacks. Go to Skullcandy's website and check the spec.'s out yourself.
I would say I get a good 10-15 hours of runtime on a single charge, and standby time is also pretty good, charges up pretty fast also!
Yes, if you use the Auxiliary cable port on the wireless base.
Buy a Droid
Yeah mate they are called, my little brother and I play call of duty online, they are light and good quality sound for the price, it's worth the money, I use them on PC
No problem, just make sure the power is connected to a wall outlet, not into the USB on a the PS4.
In fact, no. They require a transmitter to your computer or pod with USB power from a wall socket to it. The headphones are great at home only, or with power and a laptop on a Wifi hotspot.
Yes you need a aux cord to plug in the head phone jack and the receiver needs be plug in in with USB power
Yes
This headset should work for the Xbox One. I have the white version and as far as I know there are no differences. So long as you bought a new Stereo Headset Adapter and this headset was new you won't need to buy any new cables. The Adapter comes with a 3.5mm to 2.5 mm adapter and the headset comes with a 2.5mm cable. Just make sure your controller is updated (instructions come with the adapter).

We do not MAKE the games, just sell them. Do you have a question about this version?
no, they pulled the plug on everything.
I don't think so.
Go to ur settings it should let u cuz I have full control is it not letting u run to catch the ball ? Are throw?
As far as I know, only a few specific games on xbox are region free. If you bought your xbox in uk, this might not work. Ps3 is region free, which Mr Delahunty may be thinking of. Good luck.

1.8 metre or 6 feet.
Yes I use it with 8.1 with no problems.
Unfortunately, it doesn't. It can only be scrolled up or down, just like other typical mouse.
First off, the two mice are physically similar; except for maybe less than an ounce of weight difference. The button placement is identical, as well as the ergonomics. Aside from the M65's better DPI, I don't see any differences in specs (at least on paper). I haven't felt any acceleration or "floaty" quality with this mouse, though I don't play roles that require absolute pixel-accuracy. This mouse has been great for my lazy grip, which is a half way point between palming and griping the mouse. While it may sound odd, I have another mouse plugged -- a Logitech G502. That is perfect for a claw grip and works best for me when I want to change up how I play. --- ADDITION --- After doing a bit of reading, I found out both the m60 and m65 have 3-5% positive acceleration (and can't be turned off). I suppose I've adapted to it though since it's a common thing in most mice I own, apparently.
Without weights the mouse weights - 117.9 grams Weight of one weight - 4.1 grams Weight of the mouse with all 3 weights in - 130.1 grams Hope that is what you needed :)
If by accurate you mean "responds to being clicked", I've never had problems. I click, and the action happens. It takes a little bit more force to click than many other mice, though, so it may get annoying if you need the wheel to be easy to press. As for scrolling, there's a tactile little "tick" while scrolling. I.E. it feels bumpy when scrolling, much like many other mice.
4 1/2 x 3 x 1 1/4 lxwxh roughly measured
No, with USB cable. tks.
The measurement for this one is:11.8(L)~7.2iWj~3.9iHjcm, for your reference, the Logitech g100s measurement is 11.6~6.0~3.6cm, so I think it is big enough for you. Thank you and best regards, Lenka
Right. The sniper button is for the thumb.
Yes, 8.1 I'm unsure of but i run it on 8.
Yes the DLC are free this is the last Cod that have new maps with the patchs.
Yes it does work. If it is extremely laggy(which it shouldn't be) then you have to enable compatibility but you should be good.
As far as I know it does not
No, this will not work with steam.
Nope.
Yes...
Zombies is part of the free downloadable patch
It is automatically updated. Since it uses Steam.
Trying any game in 8.1 is a toss-up. You can check other sources, but the stability and consistency of 8.1 affects all things. I've heard of some games working on some 8.1 pcs, and then failing on other 8.1 pcs. But you do know that it will always work on win7 :)

My guess is Steam is just Steam with no national connection. If you are already downloading from Steam then it should work.
Yes, there are a lot of servers still up. Just check you're running the latest patch (1.7). This is most likely why you're not seeing any servers.
Yes it works i am playing it on windows 8
Worked fine for me in New Zealand
Yes it is a Steam key that you are given.
Yes. Generally both are the same thing
Well that's the way I did it. On the main steam window, at the bottom left corner, there should be some text that says "add a game". Click on that, and then click on "activate a product on Steam". You should redeem your code there.
No
No, you do not need Internet unless you're playing multiplayer.
You don't have to download this game from Amazon. Download steam from steampowered.com and open your games library then click the "Games" menu then click "Activate a Product on Steam". Follow the wizard to add your product key which you would have received in email from Amazon and the game will work.

It's not a solid color. It cycles through multiple colors
It's USB mouse.. So unless your Mac has no USB ports, yes.
Yes the mouse does freeze I bought two of them and both of them freeze. I online game and it is a huge problem. I must return both of the products.
The design looks a lot like the contact patterns of a circuit board. The light will change through a sequence of colors. The best part is the fact there is a switch to turn off the light on the bottom of the mouse.
No I doesn't. And that is how it is with alot of people who bought this mouse, including me. It freezes because it's cheap. It's a horrible mouse, if anything try and return it.
It works well with any game, really.
Yes they can. Currently only the amount of buttons can be keybound, without adding shift or cntl. But the amount is almost endless. I have all button bound, and again with holdin shift, and again for holdin cntl just for wow. It's very customizable.
mine worked fine had no problems with it
3 years manufacturer warranty
Definitely makes a clicking sound when you press the buttons. Also a bit of a different clicking noise when you scroll with the center wheel.
Yes, it will. I had no problems running it on Windows 8, or the 8.1 upgrade either.
Yes, it will. I had no problems running it on Windows 8, or the 8.1 upgrade either.

Yes. You can play the game with the computer. Obviously, you'd need to have internet in order to play with other (real) people around the world, though.
I do not think so.
Yes, you can. Play modes are: Solo, Online Multiplayer and Play & Pass. All of them with 5 players max. Good game, I recomend it.

I would download a copy of Winrar: http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm Use Winrar to extract the zip package to your desktop, and install that way.
I'm honestly not sure as I've never purchased any of my game expansions for FFXI through Steam. However after some searching about I found this website which I believe answers your question: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2292-OAKZ-7524 Just a bit down the page it states: " Note: Retail CD-Keys for this game cannot be registered through Steam. If you wish to create a shortcut to this game under your Library, instructions can be found here: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2219-YDJV-5557" So while it doesn't appear you can add it directly to your library, it seems there may be a way to link a shortcut for yourself in steam to reach the game. I hope that answers your question, and if not then at the very least you've got somewhere you can start to dig a little deeper! :) I wish you the best of luck.
Yes it is. You WILL have to make sure to allow it to install directX 9 and whatever else it wants during install. If you do not, it will cause problems as windows 8/8.1 do not have native DX9 support.
You can select what you want to have installed and once you add your new activation code your account will know you have the ultimate collection for Seekers of Adoulin - no problems.
Yes
Downloadable. But I wouldn't recommend it. I wasn't able to even get to the character screen.
I don't believe there's a buddy key, it only have me registration key for the entire connection (one key for all) a key to unlock chocobo hat, and another to unlock chocobo shirt. Those two items alone are worth your friend buying the game himself, however. Hat gives auto reraise/regen/refresh to level 31, shirt gives +50 acc/racc/magic accuracy to 31.
Yes it will.
Just one for the whole package
There's a POL viewer bug with windows 7 and beyond. The architecture of windows changed after XP. Your computer can run it! You just have to download the new POL viewer client from: http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/download/media/vista01.html?pageID=media Hope this helps! Happy gaming!

If u are wondering if the characters can be used with any system, yes. My children can bring there characters to their cousins house and play them on the playstation 3 even though we have the xbox 360. The game itself doesn't work on other systems but the characters and the power ups can.
The game is fully 2 player local coop, and Toy box mode is 4 player online
Not unless it says xbox one. Xbox 360 games can not be played on xbox one.
The figures that are 1.0 will only work in the toy box mode for the 2.0
Unfortunately 2.0 gamepieces and figures do not work in toybox or playset mode of the original game, however figures, pieces, and power discs from the original game are compatible with the 2.0 edition with the exception of playsets, note however that figures and discs themed to these playsets can be used.
Nope, you do not need Kinect, actually, the game does not utilize the Kinect at all, as far as I am concerned. No need for the Kinect!
Not at all
We use it with Xbox 360 and it's great!
Xbox360 and Xbox one are different gaming systems so the software to run it would be different.
If you want to play the lone ranger story you need to buy the lone ranger play set. It will have 2 figures and an extra piece that is clear. That piece is what you need for the lone ranger story. You can buy the figures by themselves and use them in the toy box but you will not be able to play the story that way.

Yes,1.0
all you need to have is a Playstation 3 hooked up to your TV via HDMI cable or audio video cable then connect the power base to your Playstation and put the action figures on the power base the cd dis goes into the PlayStation 3 and you're set.
It includes the system for Disney infinity, you will need the appropriate gaming system. We have a PS3.
No. 2.0 characters are incompatible with 1.0 game.
You don't have to be connected to the Internet at all! My son has been playing this game for over a year and loves it!
I have not tested it, but I see no reason why you shouldn't.
No
Yes
Reading is helpful, however, it is functional without being able to read. I have a 3 year old that LOVES to play and is pretty good at it (to an extent). There is plenty of direction read aloud.
This is the original starter and can only play with the 1.0 version characters. All the marvel character must be played on the 2.0 version software. Sorry, no marvel characters for this starter.

you get the same things... just they hook up to the console so you need the right one to hook up to the machine. the infinity needs a controller and a nun chuck.... I don't know what you need for other consoles.
The characters and power up disk work for all different hardware. So if you have a Wii U and get an XBOX and buy the play disk, the characters you have will work for the xbox.
We also only have the Wii not the Wii U and the Disney Infinity Starter Pack did work and all the characters were fine. My son finished the game so I haven't bought any in a long time. You should confirm at the store when you purchase but we didn't have a problem.
They do not work on the original Wii. My understanding it that it works on all the others Xbox 360. Play Station and W U.
I believe that the infinity 2.0 will not work on the Wii. I think you have to have at least the step up on the W to use 2. We ended up buying an Xbox for my 3 grandchildren so they could use the 2.0 - which is the Super Heroes. I still have a Wii and plan to have the old one at my house so they can play with the older one when at my house.
The 2.0 will not work with this pack, the 1.0.
2.0 characters can only be played on the 2.0 starter pack platform. your better off buying the 2.0 starter pack for this reason or waiting for the new 3.0 starter pack to come out because you wont be able to play the new 3.0 characters on the 2.0 platform. the new 3.0 characters are supposed to be star wars fyi
I don't know. You need to make sure it is compatible with wii. If it is wii u it won't work I don't think.
No
If your starter pack is one of the 2.0 versions. if not, then only those characters that are NOT 2.0 will work.

It was replacement for a broken remote for LG air conditioner got it and works the same as the one that broke. So if LG then it should work!
The one we bought here on Amazon works great. This looks like the same one...no problems so far.
yes it will thanks EF and Dime
No, only on LG brand
Yes it definitely will work
sorry it doesn't
I am not sure on that one.
by doing a search on the AC unit you will get the serial number of the remote. I would not trust any one person to know which remote works with which AC unit. Then when you get that serial number you can then go to a replacement guide that would recommend which remote to purchase. Do your own research and be successful Cheers!
it's good.
Yes, it will work with an X41.
It should work as far as I know.
Yes
i believe it should but you still should check w/mfg
The M5 model is designed for mobile devices and is not compatible with the Xbox 360 console.
Yes, this type of cable can be used for Xbox 360 chat with the Phantom headset.
it should but I am not 100% sure
Yes, the Xbox 360 Talkback Cable will work with the PX5 headset.
i don't think so judging by the pictures on the triton website the cable looks like it is permanently fixed into the headset itself, if your having issues i'd say your best bet is to take them back to the store and exchange them. or check out the website http://www.trittonaudio.com/prod/parts.asp
Its 2.5mm. The same size as the xbox controller jack for both ends
This item is for any Xbox 360 game that needs to be saved. So yes Titanfall and any other game. Works great and I haven't had any issues with it to date :)
It comes in a white box inside of the box shipped. It is not a x box product but is made to be used in it. Works great. I am very satisfied with this product.
Yes absolutely
I haven't tried it
It goes right in
You need to return it. It's not a Microsoft HDD and sometimes the xbox wont reconize non-Microsoft branded products. Return and have them send you a replacement
Yes, it can be used on the xbox 360 slim console in black.
It is possible but there are extra charges involved for long distance courier.
It Works perfect. Thanks! but. I got the HDD about a month.
No, works great! The only thing we don't like about it is, it doesn't turn the playstation on like the other controllers do.
Yes
Yes you can just put the Dongle in the USB port
It actually doesn't turn it on but all the other functions work for it
About 1 3/16 L x 11/16 W by 3/8 high
Just plug it in and it's fine
Hello Bill, yes it is rechargeable I normally get about 7 to 10 days of play from mine. 2 hours a few days during the week and a good 7 to 8 on the weekends.
I don't know, I don't have a mac.
Yes it does, but it's very short.
I've played it with ghost, it worked just fine. I'm not sure about the turbo I think it worked but I'm not positive I prefer to do it my self anyway. Ghost has the option to change the triggers so it is similar to other Xbox but they had to be pulled down pretty far to register the shot so I didn't like it much. But it does work
it wrecks it
Hi, yes it comes with a fairly good semi hard type carry case, which holds everything you need together securely and offers good travel/ storage protection for everything inside.
that's how your supposed to use it.
Unfortunately it won't as the Sabertooth has no wireless capabilities.
On PC you can set the button mappings to whatever you want. You can make the trigger the jump button and b button fire if you want. It depends on the game. On Xbox it will function like an Xbox controller only, but you can assign a button to the extra buttons on the controllers integrated display.
yes. the rockers and the additional shoulder buttons can be programmed to serves as any other button on the controller. you cant program new functions but you can program the rockers with the axby buttons so your thumb never has to leave the stick, for example.
There is no wireless version, sorry!
gaming head sets for xbox have a line for stereo out and a line to the controller for chat. The line for chat that goes to the controller is a 2.5 jack, the headset is a 3.5 jack. better off to contact Razer support to see if a splitter will work before you buy. A proper gaming headset is better if you will be using it for long periods and won't damage your hearing as much in the future. Sorry I couldn't be of more help.
Yes it does work with windows 8
Yes
All of these people are wrong in some way. This is the non-stealth version with features Cherry MX Blue switches, which are tactile, mechanical switches with a defined break point and "clicky" feedback. The stealth version uses Cherry MX Brown switches, which are also tactile, mechanical switches, but do not have "clicky" feed back and have an actuation force about 10g less than the Cherry MX Blues. I'm not sure why Razer doesn't make one available using MX Blacks, since they are better for gaming then either the MX Blues or Browns. Anyway, Ben is wrong because the Nostromo/Tartarus uses RUBBER DOME MEMBRANE switches, NOT mechanical ones like the Stealth does. Jarlax is wrong because the switches are quite different, the clicky feedback with the Blues is MUCH more pronounced than the Browns. I should mention that while I don't actually own this particular product, I am very familiar with mechanical keyboards and gaming accessories. Hope that was of some help.
I've never used the Nostromo, but I can tell you that the D-Pad is very sensitive in my opinion. It has a good solid click to it, and each of the 8 positions can be mapped to whichever keys you like. The only problem I've had is that the 4 diagonal positions are very hard to achieve without first actuating one of the "polar" positions. In other words, say you wanted position 2 which would be between W and D in your case. I've found it's nigh impossible to actuate position 2 without actuating either W or D first on accident. But if you are primarily using it for the polar values, it works pretty well.
Yes and no. It will replace some functions, but not typing. The keypad will replace the left side of the keyboard essentially, but you can map the keys to anything.
I own both devices, one is not even remotely like the other. The Orbweaver is wonderful for gaming, but the 3D mouse is an incredible design that allows you to almost feel like you are handling the model you are working on. If you have never used a 3D mouse and do CAD or animation design in 3D, you need to buy the 3D mouse, it is awesome.
the software allows you to do almost any thing that you can do mechanical, if you set it up to do a function such as ctrl+alt+w and set the function up in the other program it might be possible as you can set a button to switch programs and the macro part is quite extensive if i knew more of what you wanted to do in the software i could give you a more definitive answers.however it also depends on the second set of profiling software that you use and the application e.g some app's might work better then others depending on the amount of gui based controles eg web browsers clicking on a button is not easy but you can thell it to write a sentence where you have clicked.
This has an extra row so with smaller hands I'd imagine it would be harder to reach the extra row. It would probably be slightly better to hold in the WASD position due to the adjustable palm rest and the slider all the way closed if she doesn't care to use the extra row.
With the new software it looks like it saves it on your computer BUT it tries to get it from the cloud. The result is that (at least for me) it just kept forgetting which profile to use. In some cases I had to reboot to get it to select my new profile. the thumb has the dpad plus an extra button.
I have somewhat smaller hands and I can barely reach the third row. So I am currently just using the bottom 2.
Yes. The joystick comes pre-mapped as the arrow keys. So you could scroll like that. Or you may be able to customize it in some way. You could remap some of the joystick directions as mouse scroll wheel movement. For instance when you press the stick forward it acts as if you rolled the mouse scroll wheel forward, that should be fairly smooth for webpages. Hope this helps
This is strictly for gaming, not a replacement for a keyboard
Yes, pretty much anything with a component video feed. Isn't the best quality.
I beleive you can if you have RGB and OYR on the monitor so you can stack up dem subs!
My husband and grandson tried to get it to work but didn't. May be the gamecap may not. Don't recommend if you are not tech savvy.
Yes it does work in. MACS
That is the idea behind it. But for the price it is not worth it. Poor quality if you can even get it to work. If your serious about making videos get something like an elgato capture card. It's expensive but very high quality. If you just want to test the water and see where it goes get something like a dazzle. Do not buy this one
No it does not. Jenny
Didn't work at all. Total waste of money
Honestly I don't know. it didn't work for me when I got it. It was defective so i sent it back
The quality is very low and the software has many glitches it is not worth the buy
Does it madder?
yes!!! you MUST get sims 3 before buying this!
yes it do come with a code.
go into "edit world" and see if there is an incon in the upper left corner for the University. If so click on it and see if you can edit the university world. If not, you need to uninstall it and re-install it. If you can reach the university in "edit world", try switching households and going there with a different Sim (waring everything in your refrigerator will disappear unless you store it in a treasure box).
Yes, you have to already own the Sims 3 core game. This particular game is a expiation pack.
Sign into your amazon Account, hover your mouse over Your Account to get the drop down menu, then close to the bottom is Games and Software Library. All games purchased will be in chronological order, showing the Title, Platform, File Size, and then Product Code. Hope this helps :)
yes university life is a expansion
Try turning off your internet and turning it back on to make sure it is connected, the try red own loading the game. If you are using origin, close it and reopen then try redownloading. If that still doesn't work, restart tour computer. Contact EA if nothing works.
Yes you will need the base game.
Hello Gloria, I hope you are enjoying The Sims 3 University Life Expansion Pack, as much as I did. - To answer your question, yes, ALL updates are necessary when purchasing a brand new expansion pack. When the game was created, it was created to cater to the game version at THAT point in time. Since The Sims 3 is a game powered by Origin, it gives opportunity to make your game as up to date and fluid as possible; and considering how long ago it was created vs. when you purchased it, there have been many updates for The Sims 3 sense. Thus, your computer needs an opportunity to catch itself up with the newest version of the game so that you have the best utmost experience. I hope that this helps and wish for you to keep this thought in mind when purchasing any additional The Sims 3 Expansion Packs, as you will run into the same situation. Not all updates show immediate, apparent results. Some updates are simply code related and with make your gameplay more fluid / less glitchy. Again, I hope that this has helped. Happy Simming! :-)
I don't believe so. I'm not 100% sure but I think I tried this with my sisters Mac and discovered that it didn't work.

No, I believe this is just the add on. You're better off finding an all inclusive edition if you dont have the originals already.
no you dont have wait your registration code should be on back of the manul you do have to register your code online with square cinx though in order to play the game
Any xbox 360 ffxi disc will work aslong as you have the game installed and the codes registered.
If you bought the game used, then yes you would need a new registration code and if you bought the game new, then id file a claim with amazon that the seller misrepresented the item you bought.
You need to have the original FFXI game installed. You can get the game with all the expansions on one disc. You also need an internet connection as its an online game. Yes it has a monthly fee.
Yes, you can use any FFXI related gamedisc to launch the game on 360. As long as you register the codes you buy online to your square-enix account you'll be fine. It will download/update any content you're missing automatically.
Not programmable but compatable.
Mines still running after a few months so I'd say it's good enough for that
I don't know but I think you can configure them to.
As far as I can tell, you can only program them for programs that let you change button configs. You have to go into the button config of the program and set each of the buttons to what you want.
That's weird, my mouse worked right when I plugged it in. Make sure its on (switch on the bottom), plugged in (wireless USB reciever), and the light on your mouse is on. If all of those are working, then I have no idea.
Didnt recieve any software with the mouse and could not locate any. Now, having said that, its fairly easy to set the function for each of the buttons. Simply press the key on the keyboard you want a button to use while holding down the button on the mouse.....wait a minute...I think its the other way round...hold down the keyboard then select the mouse button...hmmm.....cant remember now for sure...&lt;laugh&gt; Doesnt matter, just try either way and whichever one will work.
They mailed me a totally wrong mouse with different name...but mine has 2 clicks.
Yes, the side buttons also function as "back" and "forward" buttons on the internet.
yes
If your asking if it's like the sound of a mechanical one no. Other than that it has the normal click noise... (Also depends on how hard you hit it)
no the instructions are on the page you order from .
I don't know what you mean by that... what's a yy or xyy?
There is no hitter on this controler
I personally don't play halo but every other first person shooter game I have played it has worked so it should
yes! all ready to go!
Yes
No, it has a little button in the back of the controller that you hold for about 5 sec to shut it off and you just press it to turn it on.
Per grandson: "The jitter mod is pretty good". Nana: "Are there any challenges with it?" Grandson: "Nope. Just the triggers". Hope this helps :)
Have you checked the add on amazon I believe that it says but other than that I don't know
I had the same question when I bought it but sadly it only works for games like call of duty
Yup it does
Press LT & sync at the same time to turn the mod on and again to turn it off. While on press sync to cycle through all 17 mods. Excellent controller if your looking for a good bang for your buck.
It's literally just an xbox 360 controller. It will work for any game on the xbox 360.
Yes
Possibly yes , but the chance of that happening is nearly impossible.
Just return it it may be broken true delivery
yes it says akimbo so yes
Its came with a paper but they work even though I dont use it
Sometimes you have to hold it for a second
Yaaa you can I use a rechargeable batter pack too and it works fine
It's a feature in the headset not sure why they put it in even go to their website and go for the FAQ for that device you will find a crappy solution for this issue in which they want you to blow into your mic every like 10 minutes or so.
Not for me. Brand new
Yes it does both. In fact it comes with a wireless dangle for the 360 so u can have wireless chat, but u have to buy a adapter for the one but it's like 24$
Yes
Absolutely. For reference, Turtle Beach actually has a useful naming system. If the model has a "P" in the name, it is compatible with Playstation models. An "X" for Xbox 360. An "O" for Xbox One. And so on. Please just make sure to check for and apply any system updates.
Yes, the XP510 provides surround sound for Xbox 360, PS4 and PS3 consoles. You can also use it with an Xbox One if you add a chat adapter and a talkback cable.
Yes, the XP510 has variable mic monitoring. Most of our wireless and amplified wired headsets have mic monitoring. We feel it is an important feature.
Yes, it has a one year "limited" manufacturer's warranty, which is typical for electronics. However, because of the cost of the headset I would buy the extended warranty, if available. I purchased my headset at Best Buy and paid an additional 89 bucks (?) I think for 2 more years of warranty over the standard warranty.
I think it's compatible but it only worked once for me. When I tried to change settings it no longer worked.
If I'm not mistaken, it works with all of them but needs a special connection for the Xbox One.

The transmitter has optical in or rca type inputs if your sound card has those or you can use a usb Bluetooth adapter or the mobile device cable for a wired connection direct to the headset from any mp3,mp4 player,smart phone,tablet or your computer headphone jack. The user manual is available @ http://www.turtlebeach.com/support/entry/830517491/
You must use a chat cable between headset and controller.
Yes but you will need to buy a turtle beach headset audio controller for chat functionality
Although I do not know of a delay, I can tell you the bluetooth on these headphones are trash.
Hope i'm not too late for your question. You actually need an adapter, check http://www.turtlebeach.com/console-compatibility and click on the model.
Yes. The headset's bluetooth port can only channel one bluetooth source at a time, but I frequently connect my laptop via bluetooth and listen to music through that connection, while also listening to a feed I create from the wifi base, which I connect to my PS4 via digital audio.
The digital out port on the transmitter allows it to act as a digital audio pass thru. So you can daisy chain headsets or other devices. So yes, you could pass the audio from the transmitter out to a stereo system or speakers as long as they had an optical input.
Actually, if you use a cord for PS4 chat you should purchase the PS4 Talkback cable, it has mic mute and mic volume control on the cord itself. The mute and chat volume buttons on the headset only work with wireless bluetooth to the PS3.
I don't have that problem. It is easy to hit any of the buttons every time you touch them though.
Its not that small, but as with another headsets you can adjust the headband so it rest nicely on you head and hears, and if you think that its going to feel loosely, the headset really trt to push the earpads to your head just enough, so you dont need to worry about going to fall from your head. And its very confortable for long periods of play.

Girls with secrets, judge dee and night in the opera. There are 3 bonus games
The hint button will give you info about it or you can also google the walk thru for the game and go to that section of instruction.
I had the g600 before i got this.The buttons take some getting used to when you first get it but the build material and quality is a lot higher than the logitech. The buttons are easier to press on the corsair one once you get used to where they are at also.
Yes, the Corsair M95 will work perfectly on most surfaces. After you download software for the M95 off the Corsair website, you can run a test and the M95 will detect the quality of the mouse mat. That will make the mouse be able to be more accurate on the mouse mat you are using.
Yes, the wheel is also utilized as a button.
The corsair website say's Win7, Win8, XP, Vista. So I would say it should work with 8.1 http://www.corsair.com/us/gaming-peripherals/gaming-mice/vengeance-m95-performance-mmo-and-rts-laser-gaming-mouse-gunmetal-black.html
yeah, this mouse is perfect for big hands.
Yes the software lets you turn off the leds
Yes, yes you can.
No, it has the buttons on the left, and there's a spot to grip it on the right but no pinky rest
1000Hz max (1ms response time).
It's available for purchase now.
No, but it's still a great game.
Unfortunately, there's no solid copy strategy guide in English. However, there are many excellent strategy guides/walkthroughs available to read online. The ones at gamefaqs stand out above the others, and have in-depth information on characters, storyline, as well as trophy guides. Here's the link: http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps3/616012-tales-of-xillia/faqs. Hope this helps.
None of the tales games really go together, except for games like xillia+xillia 2. Any game would be fine.
Yes, both text and voice dialogue are in English.
This series doesn't take itself quite as seriously as final fantasy does. I would say that besides ff7, ff6, and ff9 this game was much more enjoyable than the rest. I have played through it twice and each time racked up over 100 hours. Give it a try
Yes. It has
Hi. Unfortunately only the CD. No booklet with the game nor anything like it :(
Yup! Battles only of course and not until you have enough party members.
Yes, this is the Official States release. But third-party sellers like to list other versions under the NA release sometimes so be careful. You're best bet is to contact the seller directly and ask what region it is. This happened to me once. Good luck.
Yes it is but when you link to a character only one person can use the pair
I don't know about cheat codes, but if you get stuck, you can pull up a walk thru online, and find out how to beat a particular spot where you keep getting killed. Probably best to stay at the amateur level. You can play either on or offline, but I don't think you can get infinite ammo.
Yes, no problem
Yea
Yes
There should be no problem as long as you are both online and logged into Steam. It is the same game regardless of whether you got it from disk or digital download.
well its easy you only just put it on your computer and Install the game probably it will update something if you have internet connection at the installation process but its easy to install. XD good luck
PC version runs on any computer with Windows (from XP to 8 I guess) and the game minimum requirements. Only console versions could have a region code (pal or ntsc), which could vary in different countries.
it's like any shooter at 3rd person, it's a very cool game.
Its a disk that activates a steam game
if you mean does the game have software updates and patches managed by steam, then yes. or if you are asking about different language options (spoken and text), then that is managed from the steam launcher.
Yes it can.
No steam.
Yes it will
Here's hoping! Well I did find this description, although I have not found this list anywhere else as of yet: Tropico 4: Collectors Bundle combines all the latest Tropico 4 goodness. Bundle Includes: *Tropico 4 *Tropico 4: DLC Modern Times *Tropico 4: DLC Junta *Tropico 4: DLC Plantador *Tropico 4: DLC Quick-Dry-Cement *Tropico 4: DLC Pirate Heaven *Tropico 4: DLC Megalopolis *Tropico 4: DLC Vigilante

No steam.
Yes it will
Here's hoping! Well I did find this description, although I have not found this list anywhere else as of yet: Tropico 4: Collectors Bundle combines all the latest Tropico 4 goodness. Bundle Includes: *Tropico 4 *Tropico 4: DLC Modern Times *Tropico 4: DLC Junta *Tropico 4: DLC Plantador *Tropico 4: DLC Quick-Dry-Cement *Tropico 4: DLC Pirate Heaven *Tropico 4: DLC Megalopolis *Tropico 4: DLC Vigilante
Unfortunately I havent been able to get to work.
Back in July I've tried most every platform that you could imagine... most probably it'll never work. You should return it to your vendor if you can.
***DO NOT BUY*** The software has been discontinued and it is very hard to hack. I now have a useless controller due to that fact.
No its not compatable with the OUYA console. On a side note Forbes magazine dubbed the OUYA "basically dead" you should pack it up and wait for it to be worth something for collectors lol
Yes it is for apps that you can get on kindle
It has blue tooth compatibility. I ordered it and had to return because I had original kindle fire. Made the mistake. New hdx should be good to go. I was aiming to use with all my old Roms from n64, the controller is identical to Xbox and just as good quality. Can't guarantee longevity tho. Like I said I returned mine.
The good news Abhinav is that this controller is designed with nVidia powered devices in mind. The bad news, unfortunately the arena app acts in 2 ways, first as a device driver of sorts and second as a market place to limit you to only compatable games that it deems your device powerful enough to play. Don't fret, there is 2 more bits of good news. Once the controller is paired with your device the controller is recognized as an individual device even after app is gone. And, if your device is Android 4.1 or higher it has a built-in XBox 360 controller support for a wired controller, you need a standard USB A to USB Micro adapter to make it work.
Yes, the firmware is updated
I am not sure I have only used it with my Fire HD!
You can find it in your Amazon purchases. Go to Your Orders and then, under the product, it should give you the product code.
Yes,no problem...
2 players. But bigger monitor but better view.
If you purchase the PC DVD, then there should not be any bandwidth required. All of the data should come on the disc to install the game. I'm not sure you need Steam if you purchase a disc, either. I did not purchase a disc. I downloaded it; so, I can only speak based on the information that I have. It will take up approx. 6Gb of hard disk space for the game without any additional DLC. If you choose to purchase a download key, you will need to install Steam (1.5Mb from www.steampowered.com) as well as the Lego Marvel game (6315Mb or ~6Gb). You must register for a Steam account in order to use its services. If you have access to a retailer that has a copy in stock, you may want to read the box for details and see if it answers your questions. I hope this was helpful.
Yes. Steam required.
Hi Patty. Note that this is for a Windows PC, so I can't say for sure whether or not it will work on an Xbox. Here's the following from the back of the disc case that might help answer your question concerning storage: "Minimum System Requirements - 7GB available space, 1GB RAM for Windows XP, 2GB RAM for Windows Vista/7/8." Also "Recommended System Requirements - 7GB available space and 4GB RAM." I hope this helps.
I don't think so. However, Steam has a platform they built on Linux that runs games.
buy and play.
Yes. It's a link to the Steam system which actually holds the game. There is no way to play the game without internet.
I think you should contact the customer support of amazon or steam.
No because it do not work.
I know for a fact it is up to two players on the same console.
Yes, it is two player, just like all the Lego games are.
Yes hawkeye needs to be unlocked
This game is in English only and you cannot change the settings in the game to hear/read Spanish. However that is not the main problem for you if it even was one. This game is one of many PlayStation3 games that are region locked. This game is region 1 which means it will only work in North America (Canada, USA, Mexico). You need a Region 4 Lego Marvel Super Heroes game.
I think that one might be the "new" version and the other could be a "used" version.
My son who plays this says it's in English.
Two players at the same time
Yes, not quite that often but more than any other Lego game I've played, so annoying
One player, or two-player co-operative. No online multiplayer.

Yes, it sure does. Even though my 2 young grandsons are the only ones playing, their enthusiasm sounds like every superhero on the planet, is in their room, too! w. young

Well, I believe it all depends on whether adult enjoys the LEGO video game style or not. I am not precisely a LEGO video games enthusiast but I like video games in general, so if my boy - who loves this video game - calls me in to join him I am pretty sure I will enjoy gaming with him.
I not sure a bunch though. They have been playing off and on since Christmas and still haven't unlocked all the characters.
We no longer have any internet/cable other than our cell phones. All of it is connected through the Xbox360 just like a VCR or CD player. They just put on the disc and it plays . Internet is only if its multi-player if you want to play people you don't know. Lego Marvel Superheroes is also disc only. The Xbox-One...you must have internet because most of their games are online. We purchased Xbox 360 for about $30.00 on Craigslist and purchased older TV's 40 inch from thrift stores for about $10.00. Both work fine:-)
No, it's all the Marvel superheroes. The Avengers are are in it though.
I would recommend having at least 1 gigabyte or less for game saves, if you want to install it you need at least 10 gigabytes of storage.
Yes
No... only 1 or 2 people. Bummer.
I bought my Xbox in Colombia (same USA region). I can not help in this part. What I can tell you is that the game did not work at all.
Yes, it sure does. Even though my 2 young grandsons are the only ones playing, their enthusiasm sounds like every superhero on the planet, is in their room, too! w. young

My 7 and 8 year olds do great with it. My 5 year old struggled. He mostly just runs around and hits things. The Lego games are great because they are much like puzzles. You have to try and figure out the sequence of actions are before you can move forward. This proves a little challenging for my 5 year old and I would think most 4-5 year olds would enjoy it for the fact that they can "be Iron Man" or other character but they won't progress much in the game on their own and may get bored after a few minutes and want "help". Hope that helps.
When I play with my son and we are close to each other, its 1 screen but as soon as one of us trails off, it goes split screen and when we reconnect, it goes to 1 screen again. Hope that helps.
If it says Wii U, it will NOT work in Wii
I don't think it does, however, the game comes with roughly 100+ characters right out the box. You have to complete missions to unlock the characters.
no... you would have to get the wii version -- anything with wii u does not work in the wii
yes it does Jorge Rodriguez
That is correct and player one must use the gamepad, but just switch controllers for fave characters.
Yes, you can use the pad control and the regular control and the nunchuk.
To be honest....I'm not 100% sure.
Yes. I tend to make my way through the levels and then go back and do levels in free play and explore the city, but you can. The nicest thing is that as you complete "city" tasks, new tasks open up. So you're not overwhelmed with tasks and it kind of make the game last longer.

It has been working for me without the disc in, but I have other WMS games also installed and as long as I have one of their discs in, I can switch to the other games without switching discs.
it's been so long I forget. and don;t have the item installed anymore. sorry I couldn't be of more help.
What did you want to know about the installation?
What part of the instructions are you having trouble with?
there should have been a small catalog that came with the gameclick start button or emblem click computer or my computer right click on the dvd-rom drive left click open or explore locate file named setup.exe.it should look blue with sail-boats double click setup.exe to start installation follow on screen instructions to install i have windows 8 it asks if i want to put this on my computer i check yes by the way i finished my dvd loved it good luck
No. It isn't.
just the blue
There is a button on the top right that cycles through high, low, and off and the keyboard stays lit on high and low as long as the computer is sending power to it.
It's about 3 feet
If you're using the logitech software that maps all the keys for you then yes, you can map the key to open a website, toggle another program, etc
It's not very quiet but I've owned louder.
Yes. Macros are modified via the software (or use of the M1-3 and MR keys) and saved to the internal memory.
No
FN + F6 to mute FN + F7 lower FN + F8 higher
It's not easy quantifying this. Assuming you are using for gaming, the WASD keys are a little more the 3/4 of an inch apart, center to center. The G keys are a little more than an inch and a half apart from the left edge of the "a" key to the right edge of the nearest G key (G4 in this case). It may help to know what games you play, how you plan to use the keyboard, and possibly how far you can stretch your pinky comfortably.
The default setting of it will change the sensor DPI based on settings in the control panel for the mouse. They can range from 250-2500 and you can have 3 preset ranges to cycle through. In addition if you don't want/need the settings changed it can be reassigned for other functions also in the control panel along with being disabled if not needed at all.
stepped
It should work without problems, at least as a generic mouse.
Yes they can with the Logitech Gaming Mouse software :)
About 6 feet
yes, very easily too
Yes. It will work on Mac. However some users have reported some issues with Macs, though it should at least be usable.
Yes it is.
It does not work on glass
Its a slightly larger mouse but it feels great for those who curve grip the mouse
The G400s is larger, but it is very well designed to the form of a hand. It may be more comfortable for your grandson...
not sure about mx 518 but the g400s is very narrow an long fits my hands perfectly and I have medium size hands
did you received a receipt with the purpose? if amazon or CT-X still declined the replacement, contact the manufacture "Logitech". go to http://www.logitech.com and click on the contact us link. just make sure you got the original purchase receipt.
It's 1:1 the exact same shape and size. The only thing different is the color and the internals.
No it does not have weights. It feels a bit light but the feel is good. Can't remember the warranty, but I'm sure it has one.
Very fast shipping. I got free shipping and it arrived in 5 days.
+ / - I'm not sure mouse3 (wheel click) mouse4 (back on internet) mouse5 (forward on internet) I know those work. The others might with the Logitech driver stuff installed. I just PnP mine.
Yes, both. It's grey around the outside, the top where you rest your fingers is a dark blue-grey with black stripes.
This mouse does not have native software support for Windows XP; although--aside from possibly the Logitech gaming software--this mouse should still plug and play. This is a best guess based on experiences, but not a guarantee.
BRIGHTER
They are just a different color.
Back light is toggled on/off with a button on the keyboard. As far as I know, there is no way to time it. You can customize the colors and switch them with the profile and macro keys.
Hi James, it's not wireless. Let me know if you have any other questions. :)
No it is not mechanical.
The keyboard comes with a hand rest attachment so you can choose which one you want to use. So effectively both :D
Yes
The G510 is like any normal keyboard, not especially "clacky" on the key strokes (not like mechanical switches).
All or Nothing. One color, all the same, on or off.
It is difficult to measure, due to the beveled edges, but it measures 20 5/16 inches (20.31").
You do not charge it. Its USB powered wired headphone. Its not wireless and that's the key point that it conects to every audio-enabled device (mobile, ps3, PC, Xbox)
I must have gotten a lemon. Mine broke between the ear cup and the head band after 13-months. It was only ever used at my desk, and I typically handled it with care.
yes it works perfectly with my windows 8.1, and it comes with an attachable amplifier so you can control the musics treble and bass. Music comes out with nice bass and no outside noises.
The frustration free packaging is just the headphones in a plastic sleeve cushioned by foam. You don't need to cut any plastic, just open the box and it is good to go.
Don't let the employees of the manufacturer fool you. It is only minimally compatible with the PS4 out of the box. Most of the advertised features, most notably the separate volume controls for the game and chat, require a $35 adapter. Without said adapter, this is a discount headset at a premium headset price.
No it does not work without the Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter. Which will run you about another $30 bucks
The length of unit is over 17.5 feet long. You can extend the length on the headphone side of amp with a male/female 3.5 mm 4-pole extension cable. (Sorry for delay in answer, I was on vacation and just caught up on email)
The Amp is not necessary for PC but you lose the ability to adjust the volume in-line. You would have to use your computer volume instead, plus you lose quite a bit of cord length as the cord from the amp/volume box is only about 3 ft long.
Yes! You have two options to make them work: * Unplug them from the box thingy, and plug them right into your GamePad. Control the volume from the gamepad. * Plug them to the box thingy. Use the included adapter to get the audio from your TV's RCA audio output (or use a Component cable, set the audio in your Wii U to _both_ HDMI and component and get the audio from there), and plug the USB to your TV or another power source. Now you can use the box thingy to adjust volume, equalize bass/treble, and also to plug in your phone/tablet (extra cable included) so you can Skype while you Smash!

Yes! You have two options to make them work: * Unplug them from the box thingy, and plug them right into your GamePad. Control the volume from the gamepad. * Plug them to the box thingy.

You do not charge it. Its USB powered wired headphone. Its not wireless and that's the key point that it conects to every audio-enabled device (mobile, ps3, PC, Xbox)
I must have gotten a lemon. Mine broke between the ear cup and the head band after 13-months. It was only ever used at my desk, and I typically handled it with care.
yes it works perfectly with my windows 8.1, and it comes with an attachable amplifier so you can control the musics treble and bass. Music comes out with nice bass and no outside noises.
The frustration free packaging is just the headphones in a plastic sleeve cushioned by foam. You don't need to cut any plastic, just open the box and it is good to go.
Don't let the employees of the manufacturer fool you. It is only minimally compatible with the PS4 out of the box. Most of the advertised features, most notably the separate volume controls for the game and chat, require a $35 adapter. Without said adapter, this is a discount headset at a premium headset price.
No it does not work without the Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter. Which will run you about another $30 bucks
The length of unit is over 17.5 feet long. You can extend the length on the headphone side of amp with a male/female 3.5 mm 4-pole extension cable. (Sorry for delay in answer, I was on vacation and just caught up on email)
The Amp is not necessary for PC but you lose the ability to adjust the volume in-line. You would have to use your computer volume instead, plus you lose quite a bit of cord length as the cord from the amp/volume box is only about 3 ft long.

Stereo
you can hear with them, but the microphone doesn't work with the Xbox One. You'd have to use the Kinect mic to talk.
I have mine hooked up to my TV via the rca cables and on my Sony TV it allows my audio to have multiple audio outputs at once and I can hear anything that will play throught the TV speakers in this set of Headphones. I LOVE them!!! So your answer is YES.
I use mine for a Mac and it works wirelessly. I'm not so sure about a PC but I'd assume so.
Dont use them until fully charged
Yes works on ps4 pc and xbox 360 just fine
I'm not sure but the manufacturer or company should have a warranty.
One year just like a brand new one
It means that turtle beach as a company, is certifying that this product is up to their standards for resale.
Yes
No, it will not work directly. You need a splitter if you want both audio and mic.
It comes with a very long cord, 10 feet(I measured it)...and the cable is not like the plastic ones, it is more like a nylon cord. Great quality for the price
It's alright. Again, my review stated that you're purchasing a budget gaming headset. You aren't going to get anything stunning for your 30-40 dollar purchase, but you will certainly get more than what is necessary for gaming. You are able to hear environmentals and SFX perfectly. Bass is great for music, not so much environment. If you're looking for a musically dedicated headset, look for those without a mic. Those tend to focus more on the quality of sound and not so much the tandem.
You will need to purchase a USB adapter. Most recent Macs have a 3.5mm line level input, but the mic will not work without an amplifier or phantom power. The G430 has the adapter included. You can purchase the G430's adapter on an auction site. It will allow you to use the G230 with a USB port.
that's not a product question but a technical question related to your operating system and your software/hardware
I encourage you to ask questions on actual USB sound card products instead.
i personally think this guy's sound really good!! the "surround sound" on the G430 is just the external sound card, the "adapter to convert from 3.5 to USB" and some software tweaks so if you want a headset that can be used on PS3 buy the 430 but if is just for pc then you better buy this one.
MN#: A-00060 PN#: 881-000215 I think these are correct or very close, it's almost impossible to see. This link tells how to find them, but the sticker is microscopic - http://logitech-en-amr.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/41626/section/troubleshoot/crid/411/lt_product_id/10786/tabs/1,3,2,4,5/cl/us,en
It does, the wire is pretty long and the method for 'shortening' it is pretty much bunching it up and tying it.
as long as something is playing yes , but if nothing is playing in the headset u can still hear your surroundings but very dim voice
Is bad and you should feel bad.
Hmm, I didn't try this until I saw this question. Mine works ok on my glass desk if the desk is slightly dirty from normal use, but after cleaning the desk with Windex the mouse no longer tracks.
It is switchable, similar to the MX Revolution. To switch you press the button just below the wheel instead of pressing the wheel.
In comparison a mouse set to a lower dpi will move slower on screen(exp.400dpi will move the pointer 400 pixles for every 1 inch the mouse moves where as 2000dpi can cover a whole 1080i screen with only an inch of mouse movement). Lower dpi can be usefull when an action requires more precise control and higher is great for when the pointer has to travel far and wide.
The scroll wheel does have left/right functionality. By default it's "scroll left" and "scroll right" (forward/back are mapped the the buttons by your thumb by default), but you can program them to do whatever you want.
No, it has its own receiver and does not work with Logitech's unifying receiver.
The mouse will use any version of usb you have, it doesnt use enough bandwidth to saturate usb 2.0,or 3.0. It preforms the same on any usb version..its not version specific.I have my g700s plugged into my usb 3.o port without any issues at all.
The logitech software works on Mac. All functions work on Mac.
Yes it has in the down side
Yes, and it's just as audible as the left/right wheel clicks.
The limited edition comes with an extra couple missions and a exclusive jacket to be worn by the chracter. If the price is very different I would just buy the standard edition unless you really want those two missions.
Only redeemable once
INFAMOUS SECOND SON is an exclusive title that you must have as a PS4 owner. Watchdogs is also a good open world sandbox and its also fun too. Tomb raider is more of an adventure and action game. I have all of these titles, personally I choose watchdogs because it gives more play hours and it has a lot of fun extras games that you can play online.
no I ordered the limited edition and got the Normal version no Code.
Yeah
Almost the same the different is it has free extra mission
dont know
Well it came New (unopened) but I'm unsure what exactly you mean by Factory sealed
It is only 3rd person.
It can be used to play on a PC but it does need special software. Try this address for software- http://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-DS4-To-XInput-Wrapper
This can now be used wirelessly as of today! http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/02/ps4-controllers-now-work-wirelessly-with-ps3-consoles
no
Yes, but you need to find another driver to completely support this controller on PC.
I believe the answer to that is to save on cost, and the fact that the PS4 and almost every other device nowadays comes with a USB cord. Personally, I just use my cell phone charger if I'm not using the usb cord that came with the PS4.
The red one is out but it looks like Amazon just fulfills it and not actually sells it. Plus, it is a bit more expensive than the rest of these controllers.
Are you asking if the DS4 will work playing GTA5 on the PS3? http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/02/ps4-controllers-now-work-wirelessly-with-ps3-consoles Good news! The DS4 now works on the PS3 wirelessly. I can only assume that it would work for GTA5 on the PS3 as well, but MAYBE some of the special features with the PS4 version won't work--like the light in the back of the DS4 reflecting the actions of the game. I'm not sure if that would work on the PS3, might, might not, don't know.
I know what you mean with the DS3, that was so annoying. On the ps4 they did a great job fixing that. I've played for hours some days and the thumb sticks stay durable and also they are a lot more comfortable than the ps3. The whole remote is a step up.
Wait it does? So unlike the PS3 controller (which will ONLY charge from a charging dock or the console itself or a laptop left on 24/7), when my controller's running low I can plug it into my http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-SurgePlus-3-Outlet-Charger-Protector/dp/B00ATZJ5YS/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1401067989&sr=8-3&keywords=belkin+wall+charger WHILE I play with the supplied charge cable (that came with the console)? :D EDIT: June 10th 2014: Well after getting the console, I can confirm that the controller WILL charge from a wall charger, however it HAS to be a 1 amp plug. That belkin one I listed above it 2.1 amp and it will NOT work on that or the other 3 2.1 amp wall chargers I have, and it will NOT work on the like 4 .5 amp chargers I have either. It will however work on my new phone and new portable Bluetooth speaker's wall chargers, which are both 1 Amp. I guess something in the controller won't kick in to charge unless it's receiving exactly 1 Amp. Of course needing to charge one from a wall socket near you while playing becomes a moot point once you get a charging stand and a 2nd controller to swap to.
No it wont.. But if u didn't already know. The light bar uses about 80% of the power. So if it seems like ur battery is dyin faster it's because the battery is gettin old & it's time to invest in another controller. Cause the newer the controller the better the battery life... Hope this helps
in some ways yes in others no. kinect has more voice commands. (for now) also in the future give or take a few years Sony will come out with a VR headset the works with the camera
This camera is only for PS4. It has motion control with Move and DualShock 4 and works REALLY well. Has head tracking, facial recognition, and voice commands as well. It works much much better than the PS Eye. The only content for it right now is The Playroom: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv5uI2vlXE8 Its great for showing your face when streaming games though.
SMH! Sadly there are not that many so far (Just Dance), it's useless in my opinion if all you can do as of the moment is use it in the playroom and Just Dance
Comes with a small swivel support, and is very easy to assemble
Yeah but limited, playstation doesnt really focus gaming around camera compared to xbox
Not yet, I'm gonna need an extension too. My Ps4 is 10 feet from my TV. I'm gonna wait until there are better games before I purchase one.
Yes
Yes it does. It has thin articulated (hinged might be a better word) plates the same with of the camera (like the samsung tv cameras) that can be shaped as a stand or that supports the camera if placed on top of the TV
I assume you mean face scan technology for NBA 2K15, If so then yes you can use the playstation 4 camera for it
Idk if an extention cable is available. You might want to check with your local Game store or check online
Yes, it doesn't have any problems in Europe :)
1 - 2 players
Yes you can play 2 players on knack.
Yes. One can play as Knack and the other can play as the little side kick. I played it on super easy mode with my daughter and it was really fun. Not too hard or frustrating.
I feel that it would be a good game for kids. It doesn't have any blood or gore. It's more along the lines of the old fashioned type video games.
no it's english only
It depends. Knack is a difficult game that feels like it came out of the 80s or 90s. Knack has simple controls that are easy to learn but hard to master. It's the super Mario bros of beat'em ups. It's pretty bare bones, but it's really fun despite its jumbled story. If you just started gaming then you could at least do easy mode, but as someone who has been gaming all my life I found the game difficult. If you have ps+ I'd say wait. It is sure to be the first retail game on the service on ps4. If you want a challenge though, this is your game.
Yes, the game itself is in Spanish and has subtitles S, el juego s est en espaol y tambin tiene subttulos
It's a platformer. Not a whole lot of strategy. Think of Ratchet & Clank (without guns), or Jak & Daxter. If you liked those two, and you can excuse the overall simplicity of the game, it should be right up your ally.
pretty much the best way to describe it is it is kind of like a pixar movie. I was impressed.

Unfortunately no, this new class is appearing in the expansion "The Reaper of Souls" . With a heavy metal salute (devil horns) play on my friend!
I believe you start over but i would be happy to help you level if you would like my email is jjjwhitefoot@gmail.com
yes I play the game by my self but you do go on line but just pick play by your self and pick who you want to be. as always forever young god bless bobby lee 007
Yes. There is a miltiplayer offline mode. U can play 4 players at the same time is really great
From what I have read, Blizzard (who publish Diablo games), have region locked the languages to wherever you bought the game. So, the version bought in America has English only, the version bought in Spain or South America will have Spanish or Portugese.
Yes, there is
It is worth it. I never played the multiplayer one bit. I only played the campaign and it was amazing. I have recently been thinking of getting it again to play thru again. but if your looking for an amazing campaign this game has it. I highly recommend it.
There is an actual storyline that makes sense. It gets pretty intense through the campaign and multiplayer is good once you figure out weapon combos
You can play offline in single player compaign. Multiplayer mode can only be played online.
You pay for a code redeem to download the game from playstore. After that you can play campaign and play on line if you are a psn plus user.
I know is that this only disc
If you buy NTSC/USA version, NO. It's only English/French.
unfortunately there is no co-op mode. You can play online matches with other players but not anything local or split screen.
Not for the main story/campaign.
Yes
No
No, it's a Third-Person Shooter.
Yes it does come with 2 discs
I did not know there was any sex related stuff in the free roam. My question to you is, you let him play a game where the point of the game is to "kill" the opponent but a little naked behind is not ok. Sounds a bit skewed doesn't it??
its on 2 disks....you have to store the installation disk (disk 1) completely on the Hard Drive to play (you need atleast 5-7 GB of space). I would not recommend a flash drive.
The watchdog game i got is NTSC whereas i get my games in PAL mode. Watchdog runs perfectly well on my system
No
Not for single player. Muliplayer online needs xbox live.

I'm just like your bf and I love those games as well. I think he would like this game because its similar to those games mentioned. He'll like the game but he wont love it

I don't think EA is interested in helping anyone who uses a Mac. I had a Mac and could not play with Pets because of the horse issue, which to my knowledge still isn't fixed. They make the greatest games on earth, but they're glitchy, buggy, and don't work right half the time. I will not be buying Sims 4 either.
I brought this for my Granddaughter, but I do believe you need the first one since it is called an expansion pack, sounds like it expands the original version. Elizabeth
When we got the cd it had an activation code on a card inside the box. You can use the code on origin to register and play through an origin account.
It can be used for both.
Yes
My daughter said you can use the tutorials to get familiar with the game.
Yes they do show the instructions on how to play the game...
No, I do not have problems with freezing or anything like that with the Sims 3 game. You might need to download the latest update.
Yes. However, be wary of Island Paradise. It freezes often and you have to reset the Sim every time.
I have I just uninstalled it and try it again if that doesn't work then just uninstall it for good they had this problem since '11 and they still didn't fix it yet . Hope that helps

The cover (in the case) of the game has a code. You need to input that code in redeem code either on the PSN store or the game menu. The content is not added by default, but available only to those who purchase a new copy of the game or are lucky enough that the previous owner did not use the code. The missions you should get are CTRL, ALT, DELETE, and SHUT DOWN. These are sequential so don't be surprised if you only see one.
Yes this is for single player
what copy did u get?
only one player offline, there is no offline multiplayer.
I'm sorry but Chinese does not appear to be one of the options. I had my son check.
No
As far as I know, (I don't play this game, but I did test it out) it is fairly quiet. The one section I tested had a guy walking around. Faint footsteps, no background noises (ie: traffic sounds, etc) There is a set-up menu though. Check that to see if there are 'other settings', they may have included a section to tweak sounds. Sorry I could not be more helpful.
Hi Julian, I bought my new for two reasons first the new cost about as much as a used one and second if u buy new u are getting a warrenty I had no probs w/ the installation it's fast and simple
The game is cool, worth every penny
Yes.

If you mean that It will stop when charging is done, the answer is yes.
No
Yes it has all you need to recharge 2 Wii remotes.
Hi. You cannot compare with a regular set of AAs. Constant gameplay time is 4h maybe more if you turn off the vibrations on the wiimote.
Yeah it is compatible with both the remote plus and the regular/old one.
There is only one battery for each Wii mote that it can charge. So two batteries total
Unfortunately, it does not. Basically the charging port is only made for an exact perfect fit for a regularly licensed Nintendo Pro Controller. I have not found a third party one that will fit. I own the Afterglow and Nyko versions as well. You may want to look around at Toys R US, they have 90% clearance on the Nyko Controller docking station with I believe fits it.
Not sure what you mean...but I love this quad recharger...easy to use and very very helpful....can charge the large controller that comes with the WiiU, and the Pro-Controllers...also the smaller controllers (the quad will charge 2 at a time)...I enjoy so much I'm going to purchase another...has a sound base that it sits on...is very steady...hope this answer helps you if not let me know....AHFerret
Mini controller? Not sure what is meant here, but it charges 2x wiimotes, a Wii u gamepad, and a pro controller simultaneously. Hope this helps
I've never used it with a 3rd party remote but I see no reason why it wouldn't. If you're concerned with compatability, I did see that Nyko makes their own charger base, but only with 2 slots. But the other one should work fine. (Don't take my word as 100% gospel; just personal opinion.) Hope this helps!

The Steelseries Apex RAW Gaming Keyboard is slightly larger than the Logictech G15. the logictech G15 is 20.2 x 8.8 x 1.9 inches, while the SteelSeries Apex RAW Gaming Keyboard is around 20.5 x 8.7 x 2 inches but with the keys overall, it is quite spacey In my opinion, and my hands are never lost when I use it for my games that I play.
Absolutely. They can run any file that you link. Just link the script and it works, no problems. I've done this myself :D
It's wired.
Of what I know, they do save. But I haven't moved this keyboard so I really don't know. The reason I think it would save is because of profiles.
Generally have to peel the key off gently and clean the area. If it's under warranty I'd do so first. Breaking it will void the warranty
I haven't had any problems with dust affecting the functionality, but it's black, and it has gloss black parts, so it shows dust. Any dust.
Approximately 3 ft. I don't have a tape measure handy, so +/-3 inches.
The space bar is louder but still very quiet compared to a mechanical keyboard
On the RAW, there are no volume/play back buttons.
Yes to both questions.
Yes
Three wire fans have pwm (pulse width modulation), which means there voltage can be controlled digitally. Two wire fans just have positive and negative inputs
They're not blue at all... They are actually white. I wouldn't trust these controllers. I have 2 and both change from auto to manual controls at random.
You have the manufacturing warranty only. One year.

As B. Tipton said, no violence and you will learn how to train all breeds of dogs. There is exciting DLC that features Cesar Millan, and you work beside him on 3 intense levels where you try to get this Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever and Treeing Walker Coonhound to not fight while company is over.
A couple articles have mentioned there may be some disadvantages to not playing online. When choosing to play offline, a window pops up with the following: "By disabling Online Invasions you will not be available for other players to invade, but you will also not be able to participate in Online Hacking and Tailing. Your Notoriety will be reset to 0 and any Notoriety Skills you have unlocked will be lost."

No there is no cross gen play
The parkore and player movements give it a Assassins creed feel. Like hurdling over obstacles looks and feels a lot like AC. However the shooting and driving give it a entirely different feeling. Some of the side missions feel like Some AC side missions. Tailing enemies, stealing data - listening in on conversations in AC, linking with CTOS - eagle viewpoints in AC. It has some AC feel but a different feel of something new
It's not a PS 4 exclusive, that 1 hour of content is a Playstation exclusive. Look at the case covers for both the PS3 and PS4 versions, they could've worded that better, as in Playstation instead of PS3 or PS4. Both versions get it (and it's not a pre order bonus), Xbox or PC doesn't.
I pre-ordered mine, it's on the UPS truck, and scheduled to deliver on the 27th, as promised.
Blu Ray dvd
New copies come with activation papers on the inside cover of the game, I'm not sure if a used copy would have a code that has not been used
there is no pass needed to play the game i think you may need a PS plus sub to play online but thats all (: season pass is optional for DLC
Once you get to the 3rd (I think) mission it unlocks multiplayer. From there you can open the map and switch to the multiplayer map where you choose what you want to do.
As B. Tipton said, no violence and you will learn how to train all breeds of dogs. There is exciting DLC that features Cesar Millan, and you work beside him on 3 intense levels where you try to get this Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever and Treeing Walker Coonhound to not fight while company is over.
A couple articles have mentioned there may be some disadvantages to not playing online. When choosing to play offline, a window pops up with the following: "By disabling Online Invasions you will not be available for other players to invade, but you will also not be able to participate in Online Hacking and Tailing. Your Notoriety will be reset to 0 and any Notoriety Skills you have unlocked will be lost."

No there is no cross gen play
The parkore and player movements give it a Assassins creed feel. Like hurdling over obstacles looks and feels a lot like AC. However the shooting and driving give it a entirely different feeling. Some of the side missions feel like Some AC side missions. Tailing enemies, stealing data - listening in on conversations in AC, linking with CTOS - eagle viewpoints in AC. It has some AC feel but a different feel of something new
It's not a PS 4 exclusive, that 1 hour of content is a Playstation exclusive. Look at the case covers for both the PS3 and PS4 versions, they could've worded that better, as in Playstation instead of PS3 or PS4. Both versions get it (and it's not a pre order bonus), Xbox or PC doesn't.
I pre-ordered mine, it's on the UPS truck, and scheduled to deliver on the 27th, as promised.
Blu Ray dvd
New copies come with activation papers on the inside cover of the game, I'm not sure if a used copy would have a code that has not been used

My slim does not fit in this case. I think if I pushed real hard i could get it in there but not going to do that. I may do a little cutting to make room as it is a great case.
I think it's because people have differences in opinions on the words "fits" and "comfortably". I'd also go so far as to say that these people don't take care of their systems properly. If you have to push your Vita in the case hard, and you have to use something to pry it out, that is NOT a comfortable fit. All of these people stating that the Vita 2000 model "fits" in this case are WRONG, and are putting their Vita in danger by putting pressure on it like that. This case is for the older model, simply put. These positive reviews from Vita Slim owners are confusing people, forcing them to buy it for themselves, only to be disappointed.
It's made only for the first ps vita model. Not psp slim or ps vita slim
If you have your PS vita without any protector, it fits perfectly. Yoou can have a screen protector but no more than that. At least in my experience
No. It wont fit
Yes
4
180 degrees. You won't be able to play in the case either. But I've dropped mine a couple times on asphalt and it's done great.
No, just the Vita.
Yes it will. The slimmer model may fit will a little space because the original fits too snug. But they will redesign.
no recuerdo creo que si la trae
Yes
Super slim
Yes, your power supply is universal, 100-240V. You just need the right power cord.
Yes
Yes it plays all ps3 games it also plays movies including blue rays
If Jeff says so, it must be true. Unless Steven says otherwise ;) Woz can provide third party verification along with Morito San. That's about as much as I can tell you for now. Sorry :(
Yes it does, just one however
I haven't had an issue with that personally. That is only going to be an issue if you don't maximize the mouses potential at a higher dpi setting anyways. I usually have right in the middle which I believe is 4200dpi? Anyways one of the best mice I have ever owned especially for the price. Haven't had a single issue with it
It does not take batteries. If its not responding its most likely that either the mouse itself is broken or that there as an issue with the USB port or PC
Yes
Yes, you can give every button on the mouse programmable commands
Mine stopped working about 2 weeks after I got it; so I had to return the mouse. :\
Yo I have a bootcamped computer, when i went to use the mouse on my MAC the software is NOT compatible with MAcs. So you can use the mouse but program nothing, other than what is connected to the mouse through the mouse option in the MAc settings.
Yes, Just download the software for the mouse and you can change the "+/-" into whatever action you would like. I've done the same on Battlefield and it works great.
The colors are static; you have to change between different colors through the control panel software packaged with the mouse. You can set the frequency at which a color pulses.
Yes.. I think all mice are compatible with all Operating Systems.
Mild. There is very little sexual content. But the game is full of assassinations...
Yes. Also there are achievements and missions that can only be completed online.
I've never had that happen, but I've had some other strange problems. So far they have all been fixed by rebooting the game player. To do this, hold down the power button on the wii u control pad as if you're turning it off. However, you'll need to hold the button down long enough that the screen goes black before you let go. Wait at least two or three minutes before turning the wii u on again. As another option, you could start a second game and see if you experience the same glitch. If you still have problems, I suggest you contact the software company.
I have found no parental controls. In the options, under the video heading, there is a a place to turn the blood on or off. When the blood option is off, you still hear the sound of your weapon and your target still makes some disturbing gurgling noises and writhes in pain. By "language, I assume you mean adult language. I haven't seen an option to adjust adult language. You could turn the voice volume to zero, or the language option to French or Spanish, but you would miss some necessary dialog along with a very few "F" bombs.
there is a major sale going on , so the price is no longer 59;99. thank you.
Yeah. It looks great.
i havent tryed, but i think you can't. i will try to day.
This is a single player game. There is multiplayer for online only. It supports the gamepad & classic controller pro.
I don't think mine is multilanguage but I haven't looked.
No, my disc specifically says for the Americas only, so presumably this is NTSC.
Its amazing. However the campaign is short compared to some of the other games and. The ending kind of sneaks up on you so for that reason I don't like the story arc as much as the other games but overall it's a great game. the multiplayer hasn't changed much and as always it's worth playing.
Yes and no. If you ever played AC games things are blocked off until you finish missions same goes here but there's a lot of exploring to do and collectibles. The good news is after you get your ship and can customize it you can free roam about 90% of the game (hunt for buried treasure, underwater wrecks, hunt animals and get into naval battles). Its not exactly open world like Skyrim.
If you are familiar with the series then you will have a pretty good idea. Combat mechanics have not changed much. Its a little more fluent. Better weapon selections. As well as armors. Naval combat and exploration is a much improvement over its previous release of AC3. All in all a great buy. If your interested in trophies/achievements there is a lil more of a challenge. I was able to get the platinum trophies on all previous games fairly easy on one play threw. This one took me atleast 2 to obtain all including the platinum.
No
No you can't continue on a new console
Pretty much the same. I really don't think 3rd person mp can exist in an industry of fps shooters. If it was like gta's mp. I'm sure they'd be better off. Co-op would be a better choice. Mp matches in ac is dismal as well. Hopefully this answers your question
It's a much better game. But the graphics still look PS3. This is probably the best game in the series after 3.
Game play no, graphics yes.
the Bahamas
Ps4 is the most recommended, the WII U does not support high graphical games
By default the spoken language is English but you can change it to Spanish, French, or Portuguese on the options .
Psn codes are region sensitive, so you have to have a psn account of the same region of the amazon you get your code from, so form this one you do need a us psn account.
The game is in multi language subtitles also you can read it and hear it while the character speak I use most Spanish
You can play with other players online. But it's mostly for one player.
Yeah. If you don't have online or internet connection you can still play the story mode
I do not know, bought for someone else
I dont think so since this game have violence (guns, swords) and you have/can to murder people...I will not considered for a 12 years old kid.
My son says the later games are less repetitious and more fleshed out. Hope that helps.
I too have a suoer slim 500 gb. Playstation 3. I rarely encountered any framerate issues. a couple of times when things got really crazy but not enough to take away from the fun I had playing the game.
Yes, there is spanish audio and subtitles
Make sure your computer meets the minimum requirements. Check to see if you're in power saving mode. Turn off unnecessary programs using your ram. Turn down game graphics.
It should work just fine on Windows 8. Back of the box says vista/7/8.
I have a 360 controller running on a Windows 8 machine that was automatically detected as soon as I plugged it into the USB port (it's wired, not wireless). I didn't need to do anything special after installing AC4. When the game first started up and said, "Press any key", I pressed A on the controller and it worked straight away. No button configuring required.
Yes, just like every other game :)
Absolutely...I have windows 8.1 and work perfectly...
Are you sure that the problem come from the key? It's hard to tell without information how you cannot play. I have problem as well, first I cannot install the game because the disc has some scratches so I try the steam version instead. After I play for a while, my computer got update and I cannot start the game, so I change the graphic setting and it work just fine. If your problem is similar to mine, I suggest changing the game setting to minimum requirement and try to start the game. Hope this help.
Uplay
Not obligatory, just you can play without conection but if you conect to internet can unblock some facilities.
That is not normal. Does your PC meet the minimum requirements? If your graphics card and cpu aren't that great, you might wanna lower the graphics settings before playing.
We don't play it online, but sometimes it is really slow. Sorry, I don't have a clue. Perhaps your internet speed slowed down? Good luck finding the answer.
Yea it's ok it's very rare for it to have sexual or language scenes plus it shows historical events of the pirate era
You can play through the entire single-player campaign without an Xbox live account or membership
He does indeed become an Assassin throughout the game he was just a pirate but he grows up and ends up living by a creed instead of living by his own selfish desires
I had the opportunity to compare and I think the difference is plotted on XBOX ONE minimally higher compared to XBOX 360. Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is not yet XBOX ONE which should be an eighth generation video game.
Yes it does
yes spanish for sure I have not tried french.
Yes
It takes up 1.10Gb of space.
No it had no downloadable content the first disk is the game and the second disk it to show you how to play it's a great game
There is a multi-player option, yet I have not tried it yet.
Only the original xbox
The cord is shorter than the original. At about 6 feet, it's too short for most couch configurations, and there is no extension. Not sure about the warranty, but I ordered 2 and I had to send one back because it was DOA. These are cheaply made, but hey, what do you expect for $8.
about 6 feet
No, they aren't, and mine already broke, so the quality is questionable as well.
I have the retail version, and it is for Uplay only.
Installation DVD's and a flyer with the activation code
You don't need the disk.. and its u play instead of steam! You install it with the disk and after you should not need the disk.
Hello Belinda, this game when you get it and install it forces you to use Uplay to install it again pretty much. If you want it on Steam you have to buy it in the Steam store, however it will still force you to install on Uplay. Hope this helped!
The bare minimum pc system are ram 4g, windown 7, video card 1g, hard driver 10g
Assassins creed games, GTA5 (not out yet on PC), just cause 2 (kind of similar)
It means you can play online against other players but you must setup a free account to play online.
Yes but... It needs to be SP2 64bit and If you're running vista, you likely have an old graphics card. This needs a pretty good card. Read the specs before buying otherwise it won't run and most sellers don't accept returns on PC games.
Yes, absolutely. This video shows someone playing watch dogs on pc with an xbox one controller and compares it to his experience using an xbox 360 controller on the same game
I haven't bought a cd rom since 2007. If I was you I would download it

....
Nope but some faction in greek culture can be playable
Look into piratebay or isohunt also because the game is newer you might have to wait for the patch to come out on pc rather than steam
Yes it is! The best computer game I have ever played! I have been playing computer games for 18 years!
I believe so...I have the emperor edition and I think all it offers is a campaign that is more historical.
It says that its not on steam, but isn't that the mode where you are rome in three different areas?
Yes. You will be able to run the game with those specifications. Although, I do recommend having 4GB or more (8GB ideal) of DDR3 memory to have the game run more smoothly on higher graphics settings.
Steam activation codes and physical copies are two different things so if you want a steam code you should buy one that specifically states that. Thank you for your inquire.
Probably not, Mac is a kinda odd is for pc games, and this says pc on the case, not Mac
well if u want to waste ur money, it might but, my it guy that does repair said that this program is a pc killr of drive space
Ships from China, I doubt there is any warranty. Mine lasted about a week. Then the mouse would no longer communicate with the bluetooth USB port.
I don't remember where I got the driver but I downloaded a zip file. With it there is a button for it on the bottom right row of buttons. Clicking on it brings up a window with a picture of the mouse with each of the mouse's buttons identified. You can program the buttons for any of the functions that are supported or you can disable buttons.
Yes
It's a usb 3.0 so it fits most if not all computer ports
Yes but it will not play exactly like a GameCube Controller would. This adapter causes the Wii U to recognize the controller as a Classic Controller, and some liberties had to be taken in order to make this happen. For example, the shoulder buttons on the Cube Controller are pressure sensitive and the Classic Controller's are not, so this adapter will not read the degree of pressure you're putting on the shoulder buttons. You have to press the GameCube Controller's shoulder buttons all the way down in order for the console to recognize it as a button press. For a more faithful and high quality adapter, I recommend the official adapter (the one with four Controller ports that plugs into the Wii U's USBs). I own both and after using the official one, I'm never going back to using the Mayflash one.
I have done this and yes it does work, but I notice that the adapter for the wave bird tends to fall out. So it does work as long as it stays in.
Not great. Granted I have a cheap controller. My experience was that it randomly drops inputs. You'll hit a shoulder button or even jump and it wouldn't register leading to you falling to your doom like an idiot. Just wait for the official Nintendo adapter.
Yes you should be able to, you just need a GC controller for each adaptar
I think it's important to remember that the Wii U is not designed to read any GameCube Controller you plug into this adapter (dance mat or otherwise) as an actual GameCube Controller. Instead, this adapter makes the Wii U read GameCube Controllers as if they were Wii Classic Controllers. As far as I know, that's its only function. So if your dance mat has a GameCube plug, AND if the game itself USES the Wii Classic Controller as a control scheme (meaning the game allows you to play songs or do dances with the Classic Controller alone), then it's possible it could work. But I'm not familiar with any game that has that function.
Honestly, the device is wonky sometimes and typically takes a minute to work. Afterwards it'll work without a hitch, though!
No it doesn't. At least I couldn't figure out how to get it to work. I bought this for that particular game and ended up disappointed.
Double tap start button for proceeding and hold start button for home menu
It works in any situation where you can use the classic controller. So if you can use the classic controller to play Project M, this will work for you.
only 1. But dont buy this if you dont own a Wii remote control. It will not connect directly to a Wii U, which is why I had to return mine. False advertisement, and waste of time.

Unfortunately no, I have two 5 inch phones it fits perfectly ( galaxy s4 and nexus 5) it will fit anything smaller and maybe even a galaxy note but I have a nexus 7 and it won't fit across the width. Although the controller works great not physically attached to any computer or tablet none the less
I have a moto x and it works, so it should work. My phone is not rooted
it can pair with the ipod but some games gets updated then they dont work will
I would like to say yes because the gs5 is only marginally wider than the lg g2 (which i use) and i know for a fact that the clamp stretches further than my phones width.
I know it fits the Note 2 and i didn't think the 3 was much wider so I'd guess it's gonna be close. If you measure how wide the 3 is you can find out though. The ipega goes just below (maybe 1/32" less than) 3 3/4". I think this thing MIGHT even fit the galaxy mega to tell you the truth.
With my Galaxy S5 width at 2.85 inches it looks like there's just about another inch of space for a bigger phone.
I don't see why not. As long as your tablet has blue tooth it should work.
Push x then home once the light stops blinking its connected
No
Yes
Yes. That's what I am using now.
No
No it does not
The LL is the Japanese name of our 3ds XL (same size as the American 3dsXL). Yes I still have the box for it. When I had gotten my new 3ds it did not come with a charger (I believe it is stated that it wouldn't in the product description) however any American 3ds charger will work for it. Also just as a warning any 3ds game that you want to play have to be from the Japanese region ds games should be fine from any region though. Hope that helps. Feel free to contact me again if you have any other questions.
Yes
Yes you will get the voucher
Dear Yue, Thank you for your question. The system version of this 3ds is 5.0.0-11J. Feel free to ask anything question if you have. Sincerely,
I checked in settings and on the bottom right it says Ver. 7.2.0-17J
Because that stupid Nintendo has region lock on all their game consoles. That means different region console can only play that region version games.
Yes. The language is Japanese and my copy was shipped from Japan, but I have not had any trouble playing it on my US console.
No, only Japanese
No, but it does have online multiplayer. Co-op only.
that's impossible... .. you need to use PS3 gaming system , and it only can play on PS3 only
Not sure at all, the game functions and plays normally. Likely a description of what one may do with it, add it to your collection/stockpile
It can be played offline with no problems. The game supplies AI allies to help you out, and they are quite serviceable.
unfortunately no, some of the menus have english below the japanese but other than that not really. one point though is its easy to figure out even with it being in japanese
I am not sure that's doable, or if it is I've certainly never heard of it.

For me it made my trigger finger faster it just takes time getting used to. Yes it's some what of a mod but the pro's use them
Yes it does it works for every call of duty
There isn't much you can do if you want to keep the trigger stop in, but an alternative could be to take the trigger stop out of that trigger only, which would still allow you to use it on the other trigger.
Yes, it's the fastest way that you can't get banned for. The only thing faster is electronic mods which aren't allowed and you can get banned for.
Don't waste your money, all they did was screw in some allen wrench screw into the same trigger that was already in your controller.
Yes. I didn't want my 8 year old on X box live. So far it hasn't effected any of our games.
I don't believe you get as much as you would with the PC version, but it does have red stone with all the levers & buttons
Yes
It does have the ability to play up to Four Players, but only if you're running your xbox 360 via HDMI Cable, otherwise it is Single Player.
No
No. To get the new updates you would need to have internet to download them.
No
Yes, with the disk you can play offline, but there are not as many features as online. The disk is still fun offline though.
There is a PC version but you have to buy directly from minecraft.net It's not as easy to play as the console version, so I would suggest downloading the demo and letting your kids try that first to see if it's a fit.

yes it has two player
I had asked my nephew and he said, "Yes it is."
It has "couch co-op" (2 players on the same console). No online MP/co-op.
All you heard is correct and no it isn't worth buying. In fact, it has very little to do with the movies.
yes
yes but you cannot drift. my grandson liked it except for the drifting.
im not Shure.....probaley
No
No
Yes. It does not require gold, but you do need to be a member of Xbox live to redeem the code. If you do not want to pay for gold you can simply make a free silver account.
hello based on amazon policy must be mailed . thx jon
You have to wait for it to be shipped to your house.
No
Yeah, save data is on the hard drive and can be accessed by the games on demand version or disk version, or both!
normally yes read this first: http://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-connect-game-controllers-to-your-mac/
Well it's ment for a PC not an Xbox.
I personally have used this extension Plugable 10 Meter (32 Foot) USB 2.0 Active Extension Cable Type A Male to A Female http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B004AGX4YO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 It is possible you may need a powered USB hub at the end of the extension but I did not. I have used it for a Logitech unifying receiver and this controller module. This specific extension cable is amplified. It may not work with a webcam or other higher-power peripherals but you should be good to go.
Microsoft does not offer a driver for the chromebook, so ultimately no. You may be able to find a 3rd party driver that could force it to work however that can be risky.
No. I dont think it would work on any version of android. Windows only.
Yes it supports up to 4
The easiest way to set this device up is to install the Microsoft drivers and then manually select the driver in your device manager. With that being said there is an option to download XP drivers from the Microsoft site. I installed it on my laptop that runs XP and it worked fine for me.
Try this link: http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/xbox-360-wireless-controller-for-windows This video should also be helpful: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qY8PIGO_li8
Yes, I have windows 8.1 and it works just fine...but I did have to look on YouTube in order to learn how to install it correctly since it is a little different then the instructions it come with for older forms of windows, but still really really simple and it works great
I cant remember it has been i while since i completed the game. Did you try googling a walkthrough?
I never bought that game-this was just a suggested games they put down that I might be interested in. Sorry.
Sorry - I was never able to get this game to even install - something was wrong with it - try a Google search for "Veil of Mystery walkthrough" - good luck! :)
Did you turn left after taking out the nails to the cellar - hidden object scene. Get electical tape and fuses? Then go back to cellar and see if you can pick the hammer back up.
Yep
you get the key, you then take the key and go to your origin client up in the top left corner by the icon itll say Origin: Friends: Help you click the Origin option then add game then it'll give you an option to either Redeem product code or Unify your collection you click redeem product code. Then you copy the key you got on amazon paste it into the Origin product code bar then viola the game is the placed in your games library and is ready to download.
I don't see why not since it's a game download, not a physical copy with region restrictions.
Yep. That issue is resolved. You can toggle your running, and crouch also has toggle support.
I use Win7 64bit and this game runs great.
If I remember correctly that is about how much I got my copy for about 3-4 months ago but that was just for BF4 and none of the expansions (that I picked up separately) last I looked Walmart had a good deal that included rising china. I personally picked it up at amazon because it was a direct download and I am a BF superfan who couldn't wait to play it.
I don't believe so. You are stuck signing up and downloading origin, their version of steam.
Contact EA support they should be able to assist.
Full game
yup. buy it off the origins launcher, though. it's 30$ cheaper.
Yep
you get the key, you then take the key and go to your origin client up in the top left corner by the icon itll say Origin: Friends: Help you click the Origin option then add game then it'll give you an option to either Redeem product code or Unify your collection you click redeem product code. Then you copy the key you got on amazon paste it into the Origin product code bar then viola the game is the placed in your games library and is ready to download.
I don't see why not since it's a game download, not a physical copy with region restrictions.
Yep. That issue is resolved. You can toggle your running, and crouch also has toggle support.
I use Win7 64bit and this game runs great.
If I remember correctly that is about how much I got my copy for about 3-4 months ago but that was just for BF4 and none of the expansions (that I picked up separately) last I looked Walmart had a good deal that included rising china. I personally picked it up at amazon because it was a direct download and I am a BF superfan who couldn't wait to play it.
I don't believe so. You are stuck signing up and downloading origin, their version of steam.
Contact EA support they should be able to assist.
Full game
yup. buy it off the origins launcher, though. it's 30$ cheaper.
Yea it should since the ps3 isn't region coded.
The standard edition (currently $39.99) comes with both the Final Fantasy X HD Remaster and Final Fantasy X-2 HD Remaster on one disc. The special edition (currently $39.99) is a limited time upgrade that gives you a book-like casing that includes a vibrant 24 page artbook covering both X and X-2, mostly concept art. The collector's edition (currently $79.99) includes a gorgeous hardcover art book, a 6-hour Final Fantasy X HD Remaster original soundtrack blu-ray music disc, and five lithographs of art from both games. I got the standard version so I don't know for sure but if that is true from what I read on a review from this site then special edition does have it the artbook.
The game only supports cross-save but not cross-play. You have to buy both the PS3 and the Vita version if you want to play on both systems. But your saved game on the Vita CAN be used on the PS3 and vice versa.
There is some new stuff in the game you need the guide for
no is does not but if you have a ps4 i would recomend you purchase the ps4 version it has better colors and full native 1080p.
Yes. It does. Everything is the same. The only thing that changed is the quality.
Limited comes with artbook and different case. Both the limited and the standard are the international version so you wont miss much getting the standard.
Unfortunately, it only contains the game. I feel a little cheated, but at least this version of the game without the extra fluff is cheaper.
The differences are that the Collector's Edition doesn't come in a game case, like the Limited Edition, but unlike the standard. It is all one huge book. The art book is much bigger than the Limited Edition artbook. Has 40 pages where the LE artbook only has 24 and is smaller. The CE also comes with the soundtrack on blu ray and 5 lithographic art prints that are about the size of a sheet of paper.
I have only played 10 and not 10-2 but as far as i know, both games do not come with any additional content other then what was released on the international version of the games.
Yes. This is just an expansion pack.
Yes, I have both and it works fine
It is a download and because the game uses steam to save to your computer, you will need to use steam in order to download it. Sorry if this is not a good thing for you:(
It is the actual disc. It worked with steam.
Yes. You can not download other without steam.
No you do not need the gods and king explanation pack to play it will fine without.
The expansion rewrites over the game data so the expansion needs all 8 gb. To answer your question it is just for the expansion.
There is an option for Mac. But it is download only. Hope this helps.
You could choose PC Download or the Mac Download (depends on which you have), if you cannot use the disc, it has a online game code.

Yes you can :D
It's a disc. If it's running Android, probably not. It is Mac and PC compatible.
Yes
To ME, it is,,,the realism, an detail can't be beat if you want realism for your Sims. If you want a CHEAP CARTOONIE and problematic game, get Sims 4. I won't lie, or sugar coat the fact that Sims 3 also has it's glitches also. Occasionally it will freeze, crash, and lag a bit in creator mode, an buy mode. But if you can accept this, and do as I have recommended by perodically SAVE an continue playing, Sims 3 is FAR SUPERIOR to Sims 4. I belong to one of the MANY Sims fan groups on facebook, an I see an read the horror stories of what goes on with Sims 4. It's not pretty.
Only if the expansion you want to add is an expansion of The Sims 3, otherwise you will have to get the starter version of the expansion you bought
Are you talking about the disk starter kit, you just put them in the computer Ahs follow the directions , it might want you to have an origin account Our Sims online account though
Actual Sims 3 with 2 expansions &#128522;
12 and over
You need to go into the origin account you created to play the game and make sure you install all updates before attempting to play or game will have issues. You can access all your sim stuff on origin you may have to enter license code but once it's there you can access it from anywhere.
Yes, that is the only way you play it.
Yes you can :D

I am sure it is compatible with MacBook or any laptop. But I wouldn't know for sure because mine broke in less than 3 months, before I could use it on other devices.
No you don't. Just plug the optical cable and the usb into the ps4 and configure it in the dashboard. Only in xbox you need to plug the cable into the controller.
No I doesnt need to be connected with the control You could do It but that's up to you
No you need the base
The headset is self only has a micro USB port for charging. The wireless base has a 3.5 mm jack. This means the base needs a power source (wall plug), but can be used with a mobile device. Just not very practical for mobile use. I've never used a50, so I can't compare them.
From what i can tell it will work with xbox one. I found this video on youtube explaining how to do it. You seem to need an attachment to get voice chat but the headset will get sound by plugging in the optical to the xbox here is the link. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8uoAkm9u8g
Yes I believe allows 7.1 and I have the same headphones and it works really well. I hope this helps
Probably only with an optical switch, which the manual ones are very cheap
Yes
It should have came with a 2.5 to a 2.5 if you are having problems I would just get a 2.5 to a 3.5 adapter

Yes they do. Completely awesome
I just used mine for 6 straight hours, and 2 hours the day before, still going strong. I would estimate 10 hours full charge to dead.
I have only used it on my xbox one and my computer. Yes it is wireless but you will have to plug a wire from the headset to the controller on the Xbox one.
It's 1 in 1 out
Yes the usb is just the power,but your just have to switch the optical cable to the system your going to use.
Yes it does
I had a similar set up it completely work. I have optics out of computer and out to a optical to analog speaker system
Joel, these are one of the best headsets I've ever owned. There worth every penny and as for bass and sound quality it is also at there best you can't go wrong. Just try them and see what awaits you!!!
I'm very careful with mine as well, to me I feel like they will last longer if your very careful like you said.
No... it doesn't have any bluetooth functionality. Would be nice if it did though.

Daughter says yes, but have to do missions to beat the game. Hope it helps:)
According to my son, it is not two player, just single player. However, you can play others via the internet. Hope this helps...
I have both disks.
It's possible to change the system's settings, I believe.
Yes
That sucks. I've never had any problem with any of the Batman Arkham games.
Sorry, no, for neither single or multiplayer
Yes
No you dont.
The game is great...it come with 2 CDs.. The 2 one u have to play it in xbox live ..
I think yes, just like FIFA & NHL
maybe, if u set ur console language to spanish
No
I'm not sure I hardly play online/multiplayer, however I think it's all random but then again I'm not really sure.
no it work fine.. the kids play that game all damn day
For me it's the lakers. I've played a season and went 82-0 at pro difficulty. You just have to be tenacious on D (get 5 steals a game) and keep the PGs in front of you. You'll also need ball movement and shooters (drain those 3s!). It'd also be great to have one superstar that can forcefully get you out of a funk.

I own a Vita version but not the PS3 version of the game. It is not cross-buy because it is not the same game. The Vita isn't powerful enough to run the full game so they made Arkham Origins: Blackgate which from what I remember takes place after the story of Arkham Origins. It is a different game entirely. It is in a 2D/3D mode. It has less fighting and more exploring of buildings and puzzles. It was an ok game.
You still have to purchase them separately. With as much time that has passed since the game came out I don't think we will get a Complete edition with all the DLC on disc.
Nope no game for the ps3 can be played on the ps4 also goes for the xbox 360
Not sure, it's up to Warner Bros. Games Montral
The one I got did come with the Deathstroke Challenge Pack.
Well not completely sure but I do kniw that some of the bugs people were experiencing was due to the fact that you had to complete certain obstacles a specific way
well when i bought it from amazon it was the digital version. they just gave me the code through an email. and when i redeemed it on psn i had to download the game then install it. once i launched the game there was a mandatory data install as well.
Haroon, I'm in Brazil and, in my region, the code doesn't work. If you're in America, I guess it does.
There should be a code for deathstroke. If there not make sure the one you purchased was not used. If the one you bought is new contact game developer
Afraid not. Sorry. There is a list of ps3 psp/vita remote play titles on the bottom of the wiki article. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Play
Nope, not for the PC version. I do recommend an analog controller to take advantage of the shooting and passing features. (if you use those features)
As far as i know, no
Windows 7.
Yes if you have 2 controllers (or someone wants to use mouse and keyboard.) you could easily play play multiplayer (splitscreen).
yes
yes you can
No, I'm sorry I don't have Mac version.
Could be that you need to update your drivers. Or try reinstalling the game.
No is not needed, but a cotroller is cheap and i think it enhances the gameplay a lot

2k 14 is a huge step up, its a most buy. on 2k 14 not only are the players updated but every thing has changed in the game. The player play more realistic and there are more option in career mode.
My son says you can create a player in career mode.
You can't, you have to play the key games at least.... However if I were you I'd get 2k15. It's a lot better. Unless you have the 360 still then this is a better buy. Since 2k14 and 2k15 are basically the same game. But if you have a PS4 or Xbox one, get 2k15. Hope this helps you.
Yes
I am not sure
No
2k14 introduced a couple of new things to the genre of basketball but 2k13 in my opinion was the best 2k ever made for current gen consoles.
No
more thank likely a month or 2 after 2k15 comes out
Yes.

There is not. There's no mechanic to create your own character (like in Dynasty Warriors 4). I still consider Dynasty Warriors 4 the best game in the series, with 8 being the second best. This is one reason for that.
English
No I do not remember there any profanity or cussing in this game. I believe it's rated T for Teens
I would assume you can do split screen co-op as in the previous games, haven't tested it on 8 though. As far as I know though, there is no online play.
English and Japanese. PC had German and something else
It is in english.
It changes color according to DPI setting. Hitting the DPI plus/- button adjusts the DPI, each DPI level is associated with a certain color.
If you download the anker software it's goes up to 4000
It has pretty soft, but definitely tactile, clicks as you scroll it.
I use mine on my iMac running mountain lion and it works great for me.
It's rated at 5 million clicks for each of the three top buttons and 1 million clicks for the two on the side. Though I'm also a heavy user and it's lasted me well beyond the expected lifetime. As with any technology, it'll last depending on your good/bad luck and how well you treat it.
Literally any mouse is good for League of Legends.. Lol I enjoy it!(: I play League and SC2 with it no problem!
It's heavier than the standard mice that come with most computers, but I wouldn't necessarily call it 'heavy.' It IS large and ideal for people with large hands.
I think by specific it means user-defined. So yes, it should, but you need to set it up through their software.
Yes, you can program all the buttons, including the two side buttons, to be any desired keys.
Yes it does
I had the same thing happen- I opened a ticket on the corsair support website http://corsair.force.com/ You'll need to register first so you can log into your account to request an RMA. I didn't have some of the necessary info but I did have an email of my receipt so that did it. It was super easy, good luck!! : )
blue
Yes it will always come with a 2 year limited factory warranty anywhere you buy it.
No, due to LED failure faults with this model, Corsair has discontinued and moved on to K70 RGB
one is for the keyboard and the other one is for the USB port it has in the back
Mine haven't and I've got weeks of total use out of it.
I'm right around 3 months and they are still great
2.0 but i plugged it into 3.0 & it worked too.

Yes I have, about twenty four of mine failed after some time...
Volume up down and mute work out of the box. I'm not sure what the other key up to is as I have no need for more keys that the normal ones and volume. (I run arch and volume icon for the controlling of it.)
They work great, I see lots of people complaining that they burn out or die quickly but I've had mine for 6 months now with no issues. I keep mine on the lowest setting as it's bright enough.
Yes the wrist rest is removable
The design of the keys aren't like traditional keyboards where you push down a key, and it goes below some hole. On the K70, the aluminum plate you see IS the bottom plate for all the keys. Not only does this design allow for easy cleaning, but the way the back light LEDS shine will also be reflected off of the aluminum body, giving it a very nice glow under/around each key. I spilled a drop or 2 of orange juice on the keyboard the first day i got it, and it landed not on top of any keys but rather under them. I simply used the included key puller and removed the keys near the spillage, and cleaned it up real easy.
Yes
Yes yes yes! It's so worth the money! My boyfriend has one and I got one too! He games and plays Battlefield 4 mostly and he has had a lot of keyboards, none compare to this one! I don't even game and I had to have it! I'm very picky with my keyboards & this one is perfect! Volume control, lights up red so it's easy to see even in the dark, amazing quality, etc! Highly recommend!
Most of the keys, yes. There may be a few portions such as the media keys or num/caps/scroll lock LEDs that aren't fully supported though. Edit: As I said, it works under OSX. There are even some of the reviews that confirm this: http://www.amazon.com/review/R22XSK10XCZLS6/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EU5WIDS&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=
I too read the reports and was concerned about this. I'm happy to report that after 6 months of use all is still working well. Corsair was aware of the issue and it appears they have adjusted their manufacturing accordingly.
That is a difficult question, since the form factor differs on the two. Not quite comparing apples to apples. I looked up the CM Storm QuickFire TK and I see they incorporated the DLT-PrtScn-Arrow Key section as 2nd Functions into the Numpad area. This smaller form factor decreases the distance between your left and right hand and may be more comfortable for your shoulders, or that's atleast the idea. I haven't owned a smaller form factor keyboard myself. Form factor wise it would be better to compare the K65 with the CM Storm QuickFire TK. The QuickFire TK would win hands down, because of a lack of features on the K65- no wrist rest, back-lighting, etc. The K70 has a very nice volume controller on the keyboard and dedicated media keys, but if you don't use media keys that often or if you do, but don't mind using them as a 2nd Function, it doesn't matter that much not having them as dedicated keys. The K70 has a very nice wrist rest and this may sound stupid, but this wins high points for me with the K70, since when I use a desktop keyboard really alot, I get keyboard wrist inflammation, if that is even a term. I bought a wrist gel (3M make for both my keyboard and mouse) months before I decided on which mechanical keyboard I was going to buy so that I wouldn't prefer one over the other just because of this add-on and so that I would have one if I decided to go with a keyboard without one. I used that gel wrist rest with my mouse, and it worked for a decent amount of months to stop the small frequent friction of my wrist against the mousepad/wooden table, but then I started to get a lasting pain a little higher up in my wrist because of the declining position I had to hold my wrist in to use the mouse with the wrist rest. That said, I have no problems with the K70 wrist rest, and that just shows how well designed it is and how even if you buy a separate wrist rest, it will probably not be as comfortable as the one provided with the K70. Subjectively for me, I would go with the K70 instead of the CM Storm QuickFire TK, since I enjoy the dedicated media keys and volume controller and its wrist rest. At the time I bought my K70, only the cherry mx red version was available. I would advise you to go with the cherry mx brown version out now since it has a little bit of a tactile feedback. Also, get yourself some rubber o-rings from amazon that reduces the key travel by supposedly 2mm and reduces bottoming out noise. I use it myself, trust me, it works very well. You might want to wait if you want more back-light color options on your keyboard since the corsair K70 RGB is almost out (all though only with cherry mx red keys at the moment, I would advise cherry mx browns, like I said). It gives you options to all the colors of the rainbow and more. It cost $40 more than the regular K70 version, so it's up to you if it is worth the cost. If you have to go for a keyboard now, I would say get the corsair K70 cherry mx brown. I also use the textured key-caps W, S and D, not the A since it is curved to the left and for the purposes I use it, I don't find it comfortable. These textured key-caps are quite nice for a little extra tactile feel.
The BIOS switch both adjusts the polling rate and allows you to turn off advanced keyboard features for compatibility with certain motherboard BIOS and KVM switches. Settings of 1, 2, 4, and 8 are millisecond polling rates (1ms = 1000hz). Switching to BIOS reduces the polling rate and turns off other features for maximum compatibility. By default we ship at 1ms (1000Hz) and most gamers will prefer to just use the setting. from http://forum.corsair.com/v3/showthread.php?t=118655
Yeah, I play with my friend everyday. even four people can play, 2 on each team.
Yes, but this game is terrible, it is not like any other FIFA 14 game. I played it 3 days and then put it away and never played it again. I have every copy of FIFA since FIFA06 and have played hundreds if not thousands of hours. DON"T BUY THIS GAME! NO COMPRE ESTE JUEGO..ES MALISIMO, NO ES NADA COMO LOS OTRO FIFA, MEJOR ESPERAR PARA EL NUEVO FIFA15...ESTE ES MALISIMO, NISIQUIERA LO JUEGO YA.
It seems that the Teams that were relegated last year are still in game. IE: Nautico, Ponte Preta, Portuguesa, & Vasco da Gama are still in the Serie A of Brazil in Game. In reality it should be Criciuma, Coritiba, Chapecoense, & Figueirense. I didn't go into dept in Argentina and Colombian Leagues since its not as familiar to me, but it is fair to assume the same will be the case.
I don't recommend playing with a move controller
of course my friend
I'm not sure because my kids don't have the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil, but I think the later is a special edition issued little before the 2014 world cup started and updated to include players and teams which were about to participate in that specific tournament.
Yes
This version as well as 2013 version is fully Move compatible. Though I doubt you will be able to execute the full array of moves without a standard controller.
This year's version is very similar to previous versions in terms of controls. Small differences like ball physics tweaks are new but are only going to cause issues if you're very familiar with an old FIFA title. But I find this one to be easier than 11 for example and very similar to 13. The learning curve is not steep in my opinion. If you've never played FIFA you might get bugged that not everything is going exactly the way you want right away, but after some practice you'll find you can score in creative ways and really enjoy the game
As a franchise player as well, if you are on a PS3 I would go with Fifa 13.

I think you can play it in the Ultimate team mode but I wanted to play the full game so I got the other game.
I'm not sure if that's a serious question. The game features multiple game modes. You can play online, start a manager career or a player career, exhibition matches and skill games.
Yes it does. It has a numberof multiplayer options including co-op. It works very well.
If it's new, u have no problem... U certainly enjoy it... But used u wil regret as I used a used one, which looked like new just for a week
On one system? You can have up to four people playing. Ultimate online season can only have one person playing though unless you do a single player season instead of online.
Yes desire this game come With french language
Because the xbox 360 version is more popular and has better graphics than xbox one
Spanish & English
It should work. But first you will have to purchase the license for it. You should get the prompts to purchase license after you download the game. It should come up as a pin on your dashboard. Hope this works for you.
Very good

The keyboards near is a solid piece of aluminum. It's not modular.
It's a perfect replacement, K95 is very neat keyboard. I've switched from G15 to K95. I miss a little screen at first, but I used it as clock most of the time.
No, not to replace. When LED fails complete swap during warranty, afterwards go live with it. LEDs on the Ks seem to fail quite often.
Yes of course, any combination of keys can be pressed for the macros.
No, that one is the K95 MX RGB. It's scheduled for release in August (subject to change without notice). This model is white LEDs.
Depends on what you're using the keyboard for, I guess. The k70 had the option to go with cherry red switches (better for gaming), blue switches (balanced for typing and gaming) or brown switches (better for typing, good for gaming)... the k90 comes with the cherry reds, and it has 18 programmable keys. If you use it for gaming, and you'll make use of the programmable keys then the k90 is a better keyboard. If your k70 has cherry reds then the only real difference will be the programmable keys.
Yes you can; the macro software available from the Corsair website - http://www.corsair.com/en-us/support/downloads - includes a .pdf manual which shows how to program and edit macros, both on the hardware and software sides.
Yes
Around 20'inches
Yes, I upgraded 2 of my machines and MS Windows 8.1 had no issues with my K95 and M95 devices. I did download and install the latest drivers from Corsair in order to have the full set of utilities installed.
I don't see why not.
Yes
As a big fan of the previous games, no, it's not, by far. It's twice as long, with charmless writing, padding and backtracking, and endless tutorials.
American.
No i did not get one probably the only way to get it is if you get the game brand new unopened
It's got its moments but it's fun!

You get the map pack that has a 15$ value for 5 cents more than the original version. The map pack has 4 new multiplayer maps, 1 bonus weapon, and 1 zombies map.
Nope (about 6 hours)
The game is on a disc, while the dlc is a code
No but with black ops 2 you can download it on a xbox compatible usb drive 16 gig recommended.
Sorry, I don't know. I purchased this as a gift for my grandson.
Yes
Yes
Yes you do.
How do I find that out? I play multi most of the time and don't play online at all.
In offline you can play split screen or the zombies mode and u can play 4 players
Unknown as to why they were recertified. But these are factory recertified and do come with a warranty.
I'm....not sure what you are asking. This is a corded usb headset, which means, you can use them on anything that has a USB port.
yes
Yes they work for wii U, pc, 3ds, ds, ps3, ps4, xbox 360, ipods, and iphones
Both they have a standard connector for iPhone iPod ect and a USB converter that connects to PC and gaming consoles but you can solely use the headphones without usb
It has everything you need to plug into the 360.
Yes
Yes
Yes, it is some sort of man made leather. The product is worth the price, much better than same priced TB's. Although they can be bothersome to wear for a long period. I hope this helps.

You would absolutely be able to continue! The DLC comes on the disk and all you do is install it onto your system, it will go right along with your saves.
Absolutely. Your character and progress stay as they are and you can continue through both expansion packs.
No.only for updates
Skyrim Legendary edition has all 3 DLCs on the disc. In the PS3 menu, you will see the icon for Skyrim, then just below it will be the icon for the DLCs. Select that icon and it will take you into a menu showing the DLCs and you can choose which ones you want to install, and it also gives you options as to which language version to install. It is best to choose the language that matches the region code of the PS3, such as English version DLC for North American region code PS3. The disc will install the DLCs to the PS3's hard drive, then I believe it will require a restart of the system. Once that is done, you can then play Skyrim as usual. The extra icon for the DLCs will still be there below the Skyrim one, in case for any reason you wish to uninstall a DLC. You can install the DLCs and then play any saved game files that were made before installing the DLCs. If your character in the saved file meets certain criteria for triggering the DLC content, such as having fought the first dragon at the Western Watchtower, then the next time you fast travel you will likely encounter the Cultists. It is possible to have the cultists and Durak approach you at the same time, if you are over level 10 and have completed the quest Dragon Rising. If this occurs, they tend to talk over each other which can be confusing. As for Hearthfire, the sites of the new homes will have changed slightly, usually including a wood chopping block and some landscape like boulders or fallen trees may have been shifted. Also, the stone quarries and clay deposits available across Skyrim will have appeared and you will be able to mine them with a pickaxe. Also, the clothing, armor, and appearance of vampires will have changed if you have Dawnguard installed.
No difference at all. Make sure if you want all the downloadable content that you buy the LEGENDARY EDITION.
No
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Legendary Edition is the best version to get because it comes with all DLC released for the game.
Because you are fine with murder but the human form is too filthy.
Yes, the dlc comes within the game; it's just like downloading the game to your ps3 and the dlc you have to download from your cd to your ps3 seperately.
NTSC
With the legendary edition comes two disks. The first disc is the base game. The second disk contains all the DLC and its own installer, so you will not need an Internet connection. Just the second disk :)
In all it took 1.5 gigs, so nothing to really worry about taking up space.
No, all of the content can be played going forward. If you were level 40 or above it might not be as fun but that's a low enough level it will be no problem.
The Legendary edition has all of the DLC content that was ever released for Skyrim. I would definitely go with this version of the game.
If you really explore everything there is to offer in the game, it can get Mature. For an average player just playing the game it shouldn't be a problem. However if you try really hard you can encounter some Gore in battles and in cut scenes, you can experience some really cartoony drug/alcohol use, There is some language, and down right immoral values through out. However, I have played for hours and never seen anything sexual about the game at all.
Thats strange, surprisingly this is pretty stable, I haven't had any issues with it, I don't know how long ago you played but they have done some updates to the game to help prevent bugs. I've encountered only one issue and that was my shield literally disappeared, like in the game I still had it and still blocked and moved like I had it but it was not visible and it wouldn't allow me to do any crafting, I restarted my system and booted up my save and it was fine. In any game this massive you will need be a little understanding of bugs. Some things pertaining to the game are hard to navigate like curing vampirism and such...some people just don't know those things so I'd do some googling on that kinda stuff. This is a great game and worth the buy though, I've had many many many hours of fun playing this game through again and still have not completed the DLC storys yet.
As long as it is legendary edition of skyrim, with the 2 discs. 1 disc being the actual game disc and the second disk being the DLC content. Used or new as long as you have those 2 discs
Kinect is problematic, and you do not actually need it.
Not at all, the game does have some history based on the previous game but that doesn't matter to how you play at all and there it no character carry over like in mass effect. It will take you weeks to play all of the quests and find everything. Have fun!
You can set your PC to use an xbox controller anyway, you can also tweak the console on PC, a big plus if you're really into the game!
Short answer: Yes. Long Answer: I just tested my Game Stop Brand Xbox 360 controller with usb converter on my Windows 7 64-bit PC, and it worked perfectly. I personally think the game is significantly easier to play with a keyboard and mouse, but yes, you are perfectly capable of playing with the controller. (Other operating systems may or may not work [I have no experience with Windows 8 nor previous versions]). If you have a different operating system, I recommend looking it up on google, or asking another person before you buy the game. P.S. If you need help setting up your controller, just let me know, or there may be tutorials online.
It has the base game, but it does not have any of the DLC on disk. You need to register the product code with Steam and then you can download the DLC.
When I installed the game, I had to log into my steam acct and validate. It also had to download updates. After install, you can choose to play offline.
This is the game plus the add-ons. You don't need to buy anything else. Just make sure you have a Steam account.
Yes, I currently run mine on Windows 8.
I'm not a computer wiz, but it'll be hard for anyone to answer without knowing which mods, some are rougher than others.
PC - Download, its a digital code that you redeem on steam, you will have to then download the whole game. PC - Version it the game itself on DVD.
It comes without the DLCs. The PC version comes with a CD and a code. The game is in the CD, but you'll have to look on the internet on how to install it with no need to download the game from Steam and save time, if your network is crappy. Once downloaded/installed, download the DLCs directly from steam, with the code.
You can redeem it on steam. If it takes 14hrs to download, then your internet is way too slow.
Yes, it has the code in a paper! It will also automatically seek out Steam if you have it on your computer to download to your Steam library. I highly recommend going this route.
The wheel clicks left and right so I suppose you could program it to the arrows.
Yes it does now. Logitech released drivers for Mac a little while ago. Works fringe for me on my MBP.
The base G500 had problems that the G500s has, in my experience, corrected. Especially regarding the mouse-wheel/middle-mouse button problem. Still not as good as the G5, but it's worked well for me so far.
I'd replace it. If had one for several weeks which I use for about 10 hours per day. It's been great so far with no humming noise!
no the button clicks are normal. Be advised though that with any mouse in a high intensity clicking game (Diablo for one) the clicking can become problematic. One thing to be advised about is the mouse wheel. This puppy can spin fast and when you have it do measured option it can get really loud. Without the measured option on though it is noiseless. Side buttons and top buttons are near silent.
I have that exact setup, and you can program the g-keys individually using Logitech's gaming software across multiple Logitech peripherals. It doesn't matter if you have a G1 on the G13 and a G1 on the mouse, when you program them, they are programmed based on what device the key is physically on. So you can program G1 on the G13 to execute a macro, and G1 on the mouse to emulate a function key, for example.
By default it's just a generic programmable button. I set it to act as the mouse wheel click, because I don't like clicking the mouse wheel. You can set it to practically anything you want through the software though, like keystrokes or macros. Hope that helps!
I dont notice anything like that. The mouse uses a cartridge of weights to adjust the weight. I don't use any of them, as the mouse is fairly heavy compared to my last mouse.
If you can hear 15kHz frequencies, you may hear a high-pitched whine from the mouse when not moving it. This is due to some engineering problems with the ceramic capacitors used in the mouse.
Yes. I think it would be great for playing League of Legends!
This game is easy for anyone to play. I'm sure he will love it once he plays the game.
This doesn't have a story mode where you can create (or choose an existing) wrestler. It has Universe mode, which I am not enthused with. It is like just playing different shows building up to different main events. Different matches with different wrestlers for each card. Of course, it seems to be the same opponents for weeks on end.
Yes, he is an unlock able character when you complete the wrestlemania challenges. There also seems to another ultimate warrior you can purchase
Yes you have to to be able to go on harder levels.
You relive 30 years of wrestlemania & to finish each era you will have different objectives to complete inorder to continue but there are some that are optional. If you're like me that loves to collects trophies/achievements, then you might want to try to every objective because there is a achievement/trophy in doing so. But like i said some are optional while others are mandatory. I hope this answers your question
I'm not sure, I haven't heard anything about it
No
The commentary is terrible, plain and simple.
Yup, hes in there.
This game was well done and it is cool I think you will love it.
You can take the fight outside the wrestling ring but not into the stands.
Hey bud, you may need to un install and re install the game. Sometimes updates delete cc files on accident.
Sin Cara is in 2k14 most likely 15 as well
No
Probably, I didn't really play the online yet myself, I'm sure other people know the answer, I just basically reviewed it based on the gameplay, animations, speed, graphics, roster, features, controls etc. based on my opinion, I don't know much about the online aspect even though I do have XBOX Live but the really cool part of this game if you have XBOX Live that I do know is downloading the created wrestlers that people made that aren't in the game, that's pretty awesome and I like that, of course its better if they make them in the game but if they don't you can download peoples creations but I didn't really play online myself and from what I hear about the new WWE 2K15 at least the XBOX 360 version that just came out is that it's really not impressive at all even though people had high hopes for it cause the roster is smaller plus they didn't really make much improvements and they took out other features and only improved on a couple things so 2K15 lost more than it gained this year I have read on the XBOX 360 anyways, the only really good thing about it is the addition of Sting which is awesome of course cause he's a legend and really popular but supposedly they are going to have more improvements for the XBOX ONE and PS4 Versions when those versions come out soon and they want everyone to buy a new system which is kindof sad, in my view if they put out a new game they should make it as good as possible on all systems or not even release it so 2K14 is probably better to buy if you have a 360 and not a XBOX ONE or PS4 in my view plus it's way cheaper now in comparison and you can download created versions of Sting anyways and all the other packs of wrestlers that you can buy so the roster can be really big with a lot of legends and current guys, no game has everyone that you want but 2K14 comes pretty close roster wise, hopefully 2K15 will be better on the new systems cause I heard it's underwhelming on the 360 but 2K14 is alright, good roster, lots of features but the movements of the wrestlers, controls, speed, gameplay etc. TO ME could be a lot better like the N64 games they had a lot better gamplay to me, if they could make modern day versions of wrestling games with a grapple system like No Mercy or Wrestlemania 2000 from the N64 it would be AWESOME!
None all you need is 8 mb to save game
Yes and coop
2k15
My son has updated his Xbox and his game still works. I think that you need to contact Xbox Customer Support.
You certainly can.but only if your in India at the same time.
Yes. It only supports HDMI. Good news for you though. There are adapters out there that might allow you to convert to Component if need be. Just Google search, HDMI to Component(or whatever you want).
The hard drive is 500gb though you will have less space than that to store your items for the system uses some of the memory for its' default items. You will have more than 400gb of space, closer to 425.
Yes, you will get one wireless controller and Kinect system with the Xbox one.
yes it does play Blu-ray but you have to download it first from the app store annoying but worth it
so far they have not released anything about making the games backwards compatible. Sadly to say I am pretty sure they aren't going to make them backwards compatible.
To my knowledge, no. The Xbox One kinect has a proprietary plug and is more advance then the 360 Kinect. The 360 Kinect lack many of the advances of the new Kinect and I don't know what the plug for the 360 Kinect is so I don't even know if you could hook it to the Xbox one if you wanted.
The only games that will not play without a internet is online only games like titan fall and plants vs zombies plants warfare. Any game that has to connect to a server will not work. All other games disc based games will work like assassin cred and call of duty those games.
It is a app that u can download to phone to control or enhance gameplay on console.
Mine did not, that was when they came out though
The drivers just came out today, so you can now use it too for PC.
This controller (via USB for now) can be used with Windows 7 and Windows 8. Divers available here: http://majornelson.com/2014/06/05/pc-drivers-for-the-xbox-one-controller-available-now/
If you're playing a charge character or shoto, xbox control is better, if you're playing a hybrid/rush then the PS3 control is slightly better. The difference in quality for fighting games isn't huge. (Unlike the 360 one which I feel is worthless for fighting games).
I don't know but the listing is just for an XBOX One wireless controller no plug and charge kit.
I think the cable is 9 feet
No
I'm not sure what your asking, I would definitely get that play n charge kit, I have 2, they are easily worth it, but as for best all controllers are the same so that doesn't matter just as long as new that will more affect your game as opposed to an old one with sticky buttons and such, old triggers and a lot of use got me to buy a new controller. But rechargeable batteries are a no brainer. As for Forza that's my favorite game and still one of my daily drivers, but you should get away from buying actual copies as games are getting cheaper all the time and that's a first you that game that ever came out on Xbox one so pick it up cheap could be good but I prefer to have a digital copy. You can pick up a used copy of the game store for really cheap if you prefer an actual copy as that title is extreamly cheap now, do not buy new.
No
You don't have to buy batteries for the controller, it's really convinient to have this and charge the controller during downtime.
No
The Day One Edition includes a code for a "Day One" achievement for your Xbox Live Gamertag. The controller that comes with it also has the words, "DAY ONE 2013" printed in the middle of it (you can see it in the pictures). Other than that it's the same as the regular Xbox One. P.S.: Since it includes a code for an achievement, if you go with the Day One Edition, make sure you get it new as it will probably be redeemed if you get it used.
None
If you live in the US and buy from Amazon it will come with everything you need to get up and running in minutes
Has to be flat
Yes.
Yes it does
Nov
The factory warranty is, per Microsoft's page: "Warranty Period" for Xbox One, means 1 year from the date You purchased it; and for Accessories, means 90 days from the date You purchased it. Minecraft for the Xbox One was released on September 5th, 2014.
110 v
Yes, you will still receive the achievement. It's a little QR code that you scan into the Kinect.
Microsoft has just released the official PC drivers for the Xbox One controller. http://majornelson.com/2014/06/05/pc-drivers-for-the-xbox-one-controller-available-now/?linkId=8424381
No.
I just plugged mine in to check, and the answer is no. Mine is powered up and functional with my battery pack out.
A massive upgrade ergonomically. The buttons feel more mechanical and precise and the joysticks have a really nice texture to the top of them. The triggers are a little bigger and the battery pack no longer sticks out of the controller, everything is internal. Honestly a complete upgrade.
The Xbox One controller can only currently be used via Micro USB cable on PC.
Button presses (user inputs) and rumble feedback are examples of data that is sent to and from the controller. Wired controllers inherently have less input latency than wireless. The wireless Xbox 360 controller would only send charge power to the controller over USB and not data. You'd have to get a wired Xbox 360 controller if you wanted to decrease the latency in your gaming experience. As for the Xbox One controller, according the official support page, "When the charge cable is attached, the wireless controller converts to a wired controller." - http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/connect-charge-cable-to-controller And according to the IGN wiki, "When you plug a micro-USB cable into the controller for wired play the internal radio is shut off and all data is transmitted through the wire." - http://www.ign.com/wikis/xbox-one/Xbox_One_Controller
No
No it doesn't, I recommend the Nyko brand ones. They're just as good as the Microsoft ones.
Its just the controller, you have to buy the usb separately :/.
Yes you do and you can't use your USB's it must be the USB that the charging pack comes with I just tried myself and it wasn't charging but I guess its kind of good because the one it comes with tells you when it's done charging
Yes, it has the conquerors expansion
Yes this has the campaign mode
As far as free play? Yes. You choose up to I think 6 different nations to be allies or enemies, you chose your starting location and you choose the difficulty. Is that what you mean?
There is a setting on Steam, that allows you to play offline. I think if you choose the game and Polk around on Steam's settings you can find it, plus Steam has that question and answer on their website.
No, it only works on 1
Most computers will automatically set it for the best option. But you can always go in and manually do it. Mine usually sets it down one setting from the highest resolution setting.
You should be able to connect, Ive played online and I doubt everyone one the people have the HD version
Yes
No, this is for Windows. Although I am running Windows on my Mac through Parallels
If u uninstall steam, u won't be able to play it...the game runs via steam site

You can use a xbox 360 wired controller. Or if you have a ps3 controller you can download motionjoy and make the ps3 controller emulate a 360 controller. That is if the ps3 controller is not recognized.
I believe that the available languages are english, spanish and french.
No this is for windows based computers
Yes it does. But depend on your computer performance. Thanks
You need to chance the versions for you console. I bought it for pc. But in your case. You need to buy ps3 version
yes

No persistent internet connection DRM for Wolfenstein: The New Order. Bethesda Softworks announced that the game will use Steam DRM. You will need to be online to activate the game and to run the initial setup process the first time you start the game, but you can play the game offline afterward.
Only single player.
http://www.vg247.com/2014/05/01/wolfenstein-the-new-order-pc-system-and-console-space-requirements-announced/ PC System Requirements: - 64-bit Windows 7/Windows 8 - Intel Core i7 or equivalent AMD - 4 GB System RAM - 50 GB free HDD space - GeForce 460, ATI Radeon HD 6850 - High Speed Internet Connection - Steam account and activation required
Minimum system requirements on my packaging are Windows XP, Vista, 7; Processor AMD Athlon X2 4800 or Intel Pentium D dual core 2.8 GHz or better; 256 MB NVidia GeForce 8000 GT/ ATI Radeon X1800; 8 GB free HD space, 1 GB RAM for XP, 2 GB RAM for Vista and 7; DirectX 9.0c compatible 16 bit sound card; 6x speed DVD-ROM. I have Intel i5 4670K 3.4 GHz processor, NVidia GTX 660 video card,, Windows 7 64 bit, and 8 Mg RAM. The game runs very well at high resolutions, good frame rates. I don't have a separate sound card, I use the sound built into my motherboard, which is very good.
All these work well as long as you update the drivers. I use a XFX AMD RADEON 6450 2 GB, WORKS GREAT.
No
I can't say "yes" with absolute authority- SINCE I NEVER GOT THE DAMN GAME TO WORK ON MY COMPUTER- but previous Windows-based versions of Wolfenstein worked with a joystick, so I would guess that this one would, too.
that is what I have and it works beautifully. Just remember the system requirements for this including i7, big graphics card, etc.
Yes
A web site you join to play Wolf and others. You don't het Wolf with this buy.
The developers have made very clear several months ago that this is a strictly singleplayer story.
It's the full price and game. It's not entirely terrible if you get for Xbox One or PS4. It's not bad on Xbox 360 or PS3, just the graphics have been severely dumbed down. The story and gameplay are what really matter.
The game is 720p on the PS3.
Each level is it's own mission, you have to complete each of the level's to move on to the next.
8 GB Hard Drive Space
Roughly 24 to 28 hours
Game is only single player
not that im aware of its the same game for each of the consoles it is on and there is no online multiplayer
I had it for the Playstation 3 only had one disc wad fun game
no
No
The 3 discs are stacked together on a single spindle. All the discs in my copy were in perfect condition, so storing the discs together like this seems to be OK.
I ordered this item twice and both times got NO Beta code!!!
You do not need an internet connection for the single player.
Hello Himasagar :) You need 16GBs. You can also buy a flash drive and extend the memory that you currently have in your Xbox 360. That's what my husband did. Good luck! Jessica.
According to the information, this game requires an Intel 7 series or better to operate. I purchased the game without know the required equipment. I wasn't prepared to spend the additional monies to bring my system up to par...( in excess of 400.00) so, I plan on selling it back to Amazon since places like Game Stop etc. do not buy PC games anymore.
Start with disc 1 and then follow the instructions on the screen
Mine is the nsta USA version. I've heard the one in Germany removed all references to Nazi's. I think that's a PAL region. But mine is for the US and think it has regional restrictions.
No, it's in English
There are a few sex scenes that don't show private parts, and cursing.
I bought mine clearly marked as "manufacturer refurbished" and they came in a white box (non descriptive). All of the instructions, cables, and parts were included and each were in plastic bags, but there was nothing that was branded, as far as the packaging goes.
Refurbished products carry a 90 day warranty. These are authentic headphones that have been refurbished.
Yes it come a with a wireless adapter for an Xbox 360 controller.
The xp 400's do not allow music over bluetooth, only calls. You can pair the head set with your phone. You can answer calls and end them from the head set. The calls do come through on both ears, and I have never found ay way to use siri
It might work with Bluetooth but is designed for Xbox not PC gaming
You can run the audio through your TV..use the optical out on the TV.
I think you need to buy an Xbox one adapter. I only used this for my xbox 360.
Yeah - get the cable and forgo true wireless - LOL! Wish there was something else, but that little puck shuts off whenever it feels like it. It isn't just when there is no voice activity like TB will try to tell you, mine used to shut off in the middle of me speaking - before I said to heck with it and started using the cable from my old x32s
I'm pretty sure the Xbox One only has 1 optical port in the back of the Xbox. But I think you can daisy chain them. Plug the Optical cable from the "in" port of one transmitter into the "out" port of the 2nd transmitter. Then plug the Optical cable from the "in" port of the 2nd transmitter into the optical port of the Xbox One. You guys both should get surround sound with no problems. Have fun wreckin noobs.
You get to create your own power saves on the pro version. The bad part is that they both don't play a lot of games unless try were update recently. I tried pokemon x, animal crossing new leaf, and donkey kong. Only donkey kong workerd.
Yes, all games that the 2ds can play are compatible with the 3ds, thus it will edit if the game is supported.
They are the same! Action replay simply rebranded the same device for USA with the word PRO. This device is TRULY awesome. Saving 700 hour play file of Animal Crossing to my PC was a relief!
A little late, but absolutely. Just make sure to make use of the back-up save feature included and listen to any notes listed on individual codes, such as the TM/HM one.
it works in all the games if not update xD
Yes, it does, but there is a process. If you don't know already it's best to youtube it.
Yes, once I bought one and it was from Us so it didn't match with my Gamecard because I'm from Europe so I asked datel so switch to European and they did it. I hope I could help.
There is a way with this device but there is a trick to it. First you need to use the code for 999 maser balls. Next you need to use the code wondercard pokemon modifier or wondercard shiny pokemon modifier if you want the pokemon to be shiny. Next when you are in game you have to throw away the number of master balls equal to the national dex number of the pokemon you want. For example if you wanted a bulbasaur then you would throw away 1 masterball, or if you wanted Mew then you would throw away 151 masterballs. After that you talk to the lady inside the pokemon center and she will give you your wondercard pokemon.
No, this is only for modifying saves, and only what is available from the codejunkies website.
No dear customer
You don't need windows. The game has Mac version. Go and download Origin, then find your game and type in your key number. The game will be installed automatically.
The biggest problem is that their downloading instructions are super unclear and outdated. After hours I was able to download the game on to my computer which is a brand new Mac. (I don't know if pc has less problems with it) however I will also tell you that once I finally got it downloaded, I could only get the base game to play. Neither of the expansion packs work because I have the "wrong code" I have to say that personally for me (while I love the game) downloading it was very difficult... I have a brand new laptop so I don't think it is that... Hope that helps!
The whole download did not work for me
Yes! That is exactly what I did!(:
No
Contact Origin directly for assistance. When downloading you had to 1st register with them, so they have all your games saved. Give it a try, hope this helps.
Make sure you have an Origin account. When you open up Origin you look on the top left of your Mac screen and you should see where it says "Games" when you click on it you will see where it says "Redeem product code". Type in the code that they provided you with after buying the game on Amazon. Then you'll find it under the "My Games" section on Origin click on the game and it should give you the option to download. Hope this helps.
Yes, my daughter has added 3 expansion packs without a issue or glitch. Happy Gaming (:
You have to have Origin - EA's game launcher.
Yes.

Play Station has stopped supporting the on line races that they used to provide every month in GT5. I would buy a used GT6 game if you like the time trials. GT6 did not provide any extra races on the online part like GT5 did other than stupid time trials. I thought it was easier to tune your cars in GT5 and had over 700 cars that I owned. GT6 is harder to earn lots of money and there isn't many cars that you can win. (maybe 20) I haven't played it in several months as I got bored with it, something that didn't happen with GT5. If you have a large garage full of cars with GT5 then it would be good to own it again if you can buy it at a decent price. The racing dynamics are not noticeably better with GT6 and some think it is actually worse than GT5. I know Sony is still tweaking it to make it better like they did with GT5. It might be worth while to get it if you can buy it cheap. Certainly not $50 like I paid for it when it came out. Maybe 25 to 30 dollars would be reasonable. Hope this helped you.
This particular one is NTSC. Most, if not all U.S releases use NTSC. Here is a link to a handy list http://shop.sandbag.uk.com/OneGiantLeap/PALNTSCInfo.html
No you cannot. No backwards compatibility
No
yes, they are independent games
Yes
Here are the supported racing wheels for this game: THRUSTMASTER T500 RS THRUSTMASTER T300 RS Driving Force GTG27 Racing Wheel G25 Racing Wheel Driving Force ProGT FORCE Driving ForceDriving Force EX
You can not transfer your cars from GT5 to GT6. The physics between the two games is different making it implausible to transfer your cars. They would not work correctly.
No. This game is the worst. I can't do anything with it.
Well it's more of the same. Same format, but better cars graphics! And Yes it's better!

Yes it has all of them. The game has a digital code for MGS1 that you can download from the PSN, it has the HD versions of MGS2, MGS3, and MGS: Peace Walker. The MGS3: HD edition also includes the original Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake for the MSX. And, finally...the collection includes MGS4. The only games that are not here are MGS: Portable Ops, the MGS Ac!d games, and the NES versions of Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2.
It does include MGS 1 which is what twin snakes is a remake of, but not the actual twin snakes game. So to answer your question, no.
It is made to be used for ps3
I believe the codes wont expire, they are codes for the PSN Network and will let you download Metal Gear Solid 1 and some extra's, but problem is if you aren't using an american account it wont work, so if you need to, make an american account and then go onto the PSN Network and input the code :) It will let you download it onto your american account user on PS3 :)
It is Subsistence as per other reviews with the fully controllable camera but does not come with Snake vs Monkey minigame. Plus you get the downloadable camos, MG 1 and 2 Solid Snake from the Famicom, and other extras.
Yes, it is. As most games sold for North America.
Yes
Legacy has the HD Collection in it. The HD Collection is Metal Gear Solid 2, 3 and Peace Walker. Legacy also has 1 and 4, extra content and a neat art book thing. Legacy is a lot harder to find too, so it might be extra valuable in a few years, who knows.
According to an article on Kotaku published in 2012, "the PS3 is usually entirely region-free [for games]...any publisher to region-block a PS3 game is a strange decision;" (http://kotaku.com/5923821/meet-the-first-ever-region-locked-ps3-game). Also, the Wikipedia page for region locked PS3 games only lists two games: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Region-locked_PlayStation_3_games. There IS a catch, though: it's possible you might have NTSC/PAL TV incompatibilities (see http://www.engadget.com/2007/05/07/ps3-is-region-free-but-theres-a-hi-def-catch/). The solution is to use an HDMI cable and play in at least 720p.
im not sure. the game has been tested and it does work.
No it does not. It comes with one wire control, av cables, and the ps3.
We unfortunately cannot ship internationally.
Yup it did white one been playing diablo 3 r.o.s. like crazy.
The consule, controller which was white also, and the power cable. Also there is a home cable. It was used so when I got it there was dirt around some parts of the outside. It only took 5 Seconds to clean it off. But besides that the consule works perfectly and never overheated. So I recommend it. :)
American I wish I could put photos up to show you it run great and it's 500GB just like the PS4 I love mine
Mine did, I don't know if this was a retailer or private owner.
Yes. It has an option for Portugese audio. Being Brazil dominates most classes in mma it would be very disappointing if it didn't.
check your email that you gave amazon. I just got mine earlier.
Yes
Yes u have to buy him in the dlc
Yes it does
Nope not yet at least I'm sure in the next installment they will somehow use gameface with connect that would be sick
You will not get it on release day. From Amazon release day shipping info "Note: Release-Date Delivery isn't available to Amazon Lockers, Alaska, Hawaii, international destinations, P.O. Boxes, or APO/FPO addresses." Link -
No jumping. Hurdling over objects.
My answer is always, "Would you take your child to this if it was a movie?" The content description is: "Blood, Intense Violence, Nudity, Strong Language, Strong Sexual Content, Use of Drugs and Alcohol". If you wouldn't sit through a movie with your child and that sort of content, then don't buy them a 40+ hour game with that content. Personally, I would not purchase this game for any child under 16, and not even all 16 year olds (some are immature). If it's helpful, the store policy and most major video game stores would prohibit your son from buying this game on his own without you present. (M Rated games require 17 yrs old to buy independently)
There is no Coop mode in Watchdogs. After you complete Act 1, Mission 4, you unlock the ability to use the PvP function. This enables you to play several different types of side missions against other people online. I will say that it can be kind of distracting when you are playing a mission then all of a sudden you realize you are being hacked by someone who has jumped on your game but it offers a challenge unlike other games out there. Here is a link to an IGN article about the multiplayer experience on Watch Dogs which should give you a better understanding of the types of multiplayer missions there are. http://www.ign.com/wikis/watch-dogs/Multiplayer
You can just play campaign if you wish. You can turn off the online aspects.
I bought the disc you'd have to check the Xbox store. It's likely there.
Hi leo, it's both.... you can buy the disk or download for Xbox One and also Xbox 360. http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/watchdogs#fbid=-nNsNr5aBkK
No. The box includes a pamphlet that has information about uplay but nothing important.
It's pretty the same except for improved graphics
It has the campaign which is single which you dot need live but the multiplayer you do. You do need live to get updates on the game though. So to get the best experience while playing this game, I would get Xbox live but you don't need it for the campaign part.

Better! Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag is an amazing open world game, especially on the Xbox one.
I'm 66 years old and find Xbox games a great reality escape. I started Assassins Creed with Assassins Creed II and worked my way up. I love the "Black Flag" edition, but it can be challenging at first. The graphics are breath taking and game play a real challenge. Although, I'm not a youngster with razor sharp reflexes, I do enjoy the Assassins Creed franchise and hope you will also. Good luck and have fun!
There is no co-op.
No. There is one dialog, but you can turn the voice audio off, and use subtitles. There are also seven available languages in case you speak another (english, french, spanish, german, italian, russian and portugese). The other option would be to use headphones. The dialog is quite important for the story, but also for the purposes of gameplay, as advice from the other characters is important - for instance, advice from crew when sailing can be very useful !
Yeah, the in game menu has several spoken language options as well as subtitle options...
this one is for Xbox one but you can get it for PlayStation 4.
no, it is just suggested adult theme behind it. The language can be rough though. There are a few 'F" bombs scattered throughout it.
Yes
Game disk
They are both pretty much the same; just purchase it for the system with the more comfortable controller, or the one you have more friends playing on.
Comes with the Baby Behemoth minion, Coeurl mount, Helm of Light, and Behemoth Barding, as well as a Moogle Minion and a Fat Chocobo mount which were recently released. You'll get in game mail, which you have to pick up at a mail moogle that has each item attached.
The helm is level related I believe, so it works with any jobs under the level cap listed on the helmet description. Aside from that, the extra $20 is mainly cosmetic.
Yes its the complete base. After you dl the game and go to Square Enix and create an account and go to log in the game it dls the patches for any and all updates!
The CE comes with a copy of the game and the benefits. You donr have to buy the game and the CE to get the benefits. Hope this helps.
Your character will be on both. It's tied to an account not PC/ps4
the collector edition items are adquire in game via the moggle messge. go to any place where there is a moggle message serivice, it appears at the map like a tegami or a mail sign. youy pick it then use it. presto.
Well yeah it have its own many story line. A lots of sidequest. Best of all. It will never be pay to win. Got to put some effort to get the best things.
Purchasing the game comes with a 30 day free trial. Or at least it did when I bought the game. After that its about 15.00 dollars a month give or take. I believe you can also do a "pay as you go" using Crysta purchased on the Square Enix site but I dont know how that works.

The CE comes with a copy of the game and the benefits. You donr have to buy the game and the CE to get the benefits. Hope this helps.
Your character will be on both. It's tied to an account not PC/ps4
the collector edition items are adquire in game via the moggle messge. go to any place where there is a moggle message serivice, it appears at the map like a tegami or a mail sign. youy pick it then use it. presto.
Well yeah it have its own many story line. A lots of sidequest. Best of all. It will never be pay to win. Got to put some effort to get the best things.
Purchasing the game comes with a 30 day free trial. Or at least it did when I bought the game. After that its about 15.00 dollars a month give or take. I believe you can also do a "pay as you go" using Crysta purchased on the Square Enix site but I dont know how that works.
You can
Yes, it will work. PS4 games aren't region locked.
You can play up to 8 I'm pretty sure, however, playing more than two people is difficult and annoying because one player for each team is usually optimal.
Only English French and Spanish
Yesss!!!!!
I don't understand your question! If you mean about the weight of the PS4, its weight is about 2.8 kg.
Buy it here it is in Italian or Atleast Spanish.
You cant really tell on the outside ... but if you check the spine of the case you can see CUSA followed by a code ... assuming that it is a batch number from the US
I believe it does.
I guess Yes, you will enjoy.

Yes, but until 12/31/2014
37.1 GB
I would say yes i havent experienced anything majorly wrong with it so far.
you will not have to repurchase the map packs but if you bought shortcut kits they don't transfer over
Nope.
Yes Can Put In Spanish...
You can only play on the platform you have. good news is its more players and all the maps are bigger
Yes
Online yes, but not split screen
From my research it seems that: WHAT IS BATTLEFIELD 4 PREMIUM? Membership in Battlefield 4 Premium gives you advantages like early access to all the Battlefield 4 expansion packs, exclusive customization options, 12 Battlepacks and much more.
i didn't get the bruce lee and i pre ordered it the day they announced i was common out
Yes, in 'Gameplay Settings' the bottom option allows you to select your audio language between English, French, German, Mexican Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.
No. It does NOT require online play pass
Yes its two players locally
Yes
There is no tag team, its only a 1v1 scenario but there is online as well
It depends in the difficulty playing it with a friends is a must have game ,
I believe so. I've never played against another person offline, but I believe you can as long as you have two controllers, it should work.
I don't believe you need to be connected to the internet to play.
Yes
CLAW grip mouse
You can! You have to install the Corsair M40 Mouse configuration program (available on their website) but you can remap it to another prebuilt command or to emulate a keystroke.
regula size mouse.
The website system requirements state that it works in Windows 8. I plugged it into my surface tablet for a test, worked immediately.
If free-scrolling is the kind you can flick and it keeps spinning, then no - it's an incremental click scroll.
Nope
There's only 3 levels and they're preset, no granular control. The buttons right below the mouse wheel is what controls the DPI. I can't remember what the numbers were but the highest was over 1k.
Try contacting Corsair customer support if your warranty is still valid, and try another mouse and see if you have similar problems. I don't believe it's a design flaw with the mouse itself, it's either a defective unit or something is wrong with the settings on your computer, or the computer/internet is just lagging.
Yes, you are able to turn the Corsair glow off if you want through the software that you download from their website.
just the logo
Yes, there are two discs. Disc 1 is the installation disc. Disc 2 is the "play" disc, meaning you have to have it in the X-Box while you are playing the game.
I've always bought new games but if I did buy a preowned game I would make sure they had a great review from them positive feed hope this helps
I would say no, I really didn't know how bad it was until I started playing it. The language and sexual references and actual sexual content, I feel make this game much worse than a rated R movie. The game itself and free play world are amazing, I wish you could edit the other stuff out.
Yes
8gb is required to play the game. I would get this for a 11yr old. My daughter is 13 and I just bought it for her. I think as long as the children who play this game knows right from wrong and is respectful, then it should be okay. I would buy the game from Xbox store instead of amazon. My daughters game only worked 1 day. Now I have to buy her another one. I could of returned it for an exchange of a new one but she threw away the box and label.
Hello! Thanks for your question. The best that I can tell is that you need the disc in order to play the game. So I think that as long as you download it once, you shouldn't have to re-download the game again. All you would need is the disc to play the game. Again, I am not 100% sure about this but from experience that is how it's always been. Sorry if I could not provide you with a better answer.
No because, there is less to do on Assassin's creed. It also has a smaller area than GTA V where as GTA V has a huge world with variety of gameplay. But this is just my opinion and I feel that kids and young teenagers should buy Assassin's creed due to GTA V having a lot of profanity in it. If GTA could tone that down then GTA V is for me a 100% fun time.
I don't know seems pretty cheap when I bought it I thought it was fake or something but I took a risk and everything seems pretty good works great runs great I've had no problems good game and good deal
This is made for USA made consoles. So it probably wouldn't work for any other country.
I would think of it this way. You should play it with your boy and explain things along the way. Just like would you let them watch Road warriors the movie by them selves or with you watching it with them.
Not to my knowledge but you can google it. I saw some youtube videos where you can change the language, so do some digging.
Yes nuke town is on it. Also come with a free map pack down loan that adds 4 more multiplayer levels and a zombie level. Its a great buy.
DLC has to be redeemed through the psn store, even if it's the gotye. You should receive a 12 digit code to redeem for dlc, or purchase it separately in the store
when i bought it the code worked so you shouldnt have a problem
It includes the game, with a code for the digital download. Yes.
Yea there's actually a paper and on the back comes a code for the first DLC Map pack
Yes, Thanks
I don't know if you can change the language but I don't believe it's in Spanish. The one I got wasn't.
No
I think nuke town is included also
YES , you can play this game OFF LINE , these people don't know what they are talking about. The game has game save issues , but if you disconnect your console from the internet and play it like you would any other game your game saves will work because its not going through EA's servers then to cloud saving. All of your saves will go directly to the hard drive like they are supposed to. If you get busted by a cop or just wreck your car to much and are automatically sent back to the garage , make sure you exit the garage and come back in again because the game does not save when those two things happen. Always visit a garage before shuting down your console because that is the only way to save. Just play off line to avoid losing you save game data. Also don't listed to anyone that tells you there is no off line play because there is and the game functions the exact same way as it does online except you don't have live players running around it is just the game AI drivers which is all I need because the game is still tons of fun even without the online feature. Everything you can do online , you can do off line Except race live players.
Hmmm I can't say anything for the ps4 version cause I only have the xbone, but the only bug I've encountered that's rather annoying is the start menu opening by itself while I'm free driving or in a race, other than that it's been pretty good and fun!
Not sure what a "Hear" drive is. All i have is an Xbox1 with no Kinect and it works as it should.
No. There have been no know patches. Unfortunately, it appears that this may not see a patch.
Yes, great game. Very kid friendly also.
Yes
I think the original would be ok as long as your 6 year old isn't going to be devastated by the loss of an earned vehicle. The open road and easy controls do provide an excellent means of entertainment.
This game do not require Kinect so if you don't have Kinect you will be able to use it without a problem :)

Yes
No. One player or multiplayer online only.
Yes. In this game you can play either as cops or the racer. Each side has their own cars and challenges.
No there isn't. Its region free. However, my console abs game are from US
No, I rented it through GameFly and there was no code. Just pop the disc in and play :)
It's less like the original hot pursuit from 1998 and more like the hot pursuit from 2010, whichever one it is you're referring to. While you're not consistantly selecting tracks to race on, it's more like having all the tracks combined into one seemingly cohesive environment, which you can either drive to yourself or "jump" to from your Hideout/Command Post. To be honest, it is what you want it to be; if you like more arcade-style racing where you go race to race, do that. If you want to just drive around until you find something you fancy, you can do that too. The nice thing that makes Rivals so compatable with different player types is that it allows you to make the game what you will. Don't like free roam? Don't free roam. Want to drive around challenging other racers head-to-head or messing with cops because you can? You can do that too.
Yes it is.
It's the same game , just has some bonus cars added by online download.That's the only difference that i saw.
Some of the game can be played offline but it requires an internet connection for a good portion as for the audio I am not sure never tried
Do you mean the controller? No it is not controlled by the motion of your hands, and I could not find a setting for it. Controls are easy to use with the analog joystick/moveable pad on the controller yes.
yes my friend I have my ps4 connected to a home theatre and it sounds amazing

I don't know the official rating, but I can say from playing that the game has no foul language, nudity, or adult situations. It doesn't have blood either, though it does have cartoon-like violence (your character dies often and generally goes around eating animals). If you get it for a kid you might consider adjusting the settings to make it easier, since it can be pretty hard.
Hi, yes :) Under the name of the game, on the top of the page -&gt; "DRM: Steam DRM"
The multiplayer is in beta right now. You can buy the beta separately to access online now, or wait until it's released for free to everyone.
This is the Don't Starve game. It is just a code, instead of a disc, which you enter through steam to download a copy of the game.
This is the online code needed to activate the game on Steam.
no
you can't run this game from your Amazon Tablet. Its system requirements are: Windows XP/Vista/Windows 7/Windows 8
No it doesn't. I can be bought on steam for about $5 if I remember correctly
Yes, it is.
You get a CD key, for the game and you give him the CD key. I don't know if it is usable in other countries though.

15 or 16 hours?????? i beat it in 5, like every other COD game. even on the hardest setting.
The DLC ar multiplayer packs. They contain new mp maps and new episodes of extinction cooperative game. There are 2 more packs coming.
Of course
physical
I don't think so
No we don't. Sorry
I have noticed it lagging a lot more lately. It didnt do that before Advanced Warfare came out. It may be because of the lack of people playing it now which would result in the lack of good connections.
no you cannot
Yes, mine is 720
No
Yes, I have it running on both 8.0 and 8.1 and it runs fine!
In the Train mode, on the left panel, there are seven choices for the player. The bottom one is "Show best move". It is the best move for you, the player. Houdini will then make the best choice for your computer opponent. I have tried this choice for many chess puzzles and it is correct every time.
We haven't been told if there is. At some point in the future there should be, but we just don't know when. This is supposed to work with a Mac if you have Windows-emulator software. VMWare Fusion (which I believe can be downloaded online) is supposed to allow you to use Windows products on a Mac computer. You might want to research that.
I am not sure because I only have one PC but I do know where you can find the answer. You can email Chess King support. The email address: support@chess-king.com I hope that helps! Mike :-)
According to the Chess King web page; all software is compatible with the Windows systems - XP thru win8. (see Paul Edvalson's comment)
Yes it does
My console came with an already used PS+ membership but Amazon replaced. Everything else was Good.
The Sony warranty is 1 year. Sony offers an extended warranty for 36 months at $40 for standard or $50 for accident protection.
You just have to write the code in the "Redeem codes" section of Playstation Store.
I believe 2.
Yes
This one came to us as the English version. Our kids love this.
You can use the figures from any skylanders game that came out before swap force did.
Yes
Yes. The portal platform with USB comes with this set.
Dear value Amazon Customer, Thank you for your question Unfortunately, the Trap Team will not work with the Swap Force. The Trap Team only works with the new portal, however all Skylanders figures will work in the new portal Thank you for your interest and we wish this information help you.
To get from beginning to end in a linear fashion you could do it with just a hand full of figures, but there are side areas and alternate paths that would require a full compliment skylanders to take full advantage of the game.
The Skylanders from Giants and Spyros Adventure will work on the portal. The only ones that won't work are from the newest game Trap Team, it has a new portal. You can also use the old games with the Swap Force portal. I also read the portal will work on a Wii or a PlayStation, although we haven't tried it yet.
Nope. There is a separate set.

I bought the disk version with the cable when it was on sale at a deep discount. All you need is the license key from the box by which you can log into your Steam account and activate the new game by entering the license key after which the latest edition (all patches included) will proceed to download to your games library. if you did use the disk, you wouldn't have all the patches and the game would patch after activation. Just using the code through steam, no drive is necessary.
Yes, this will get you there. There are a bunch of videos included with it starting with the absolute basics of holding and stringing the guitar. Most people don't watch many of them, like me, and just can pick it up and go from there. You can get to be pretty decent just by working through the songs. This has more than what you need to get proficient, aka able to play but not like a pro necessarily
Activation key does come with the DVD version. It is inside the DVD case.
No, you shouldn't have to hold it. Your female connector (spring steel clips) are probably stretched out a little.
As long as your version meets the minimum Requirements.
In order to use your guitar with Rocksmith, you do not use an amp at all. You plug the guitar to the computer with the Ubisoft Rocksmith Real Tone Cable.
Not if you have steam. Just activate it on there and you can download steam to your GFs computer. JUst bring your cable.
The cable is 1/4" male jack at one end and USB at the other end.
Absolutely. I loath video games and am by no means a gamer, but I love playing Rocksmith. You can set the level for absolute beginner or advanced player. One great feature is that you have the option of picking a song and playing it over and over. With each pass, the game will get just a little more difficult and pull you closer to mastery. A second great feature is the simple arcade type game feature. Here you can play simple games that will focus on a number of technique elements including chords, scales, picking, sliding, etc. As a music student enrolled in a guitar program, I can't recommend this game highly enough.
This game actually teaches you the cords so you could pick up other songs and play them after you get good at this game. It won't really help with "Sheet music" and music theory as much though.
Yes there is. I knew nothing when I started with the original Rocksmith and this version is much improved. In both they show you everything even down to the names of each part of the guitar. They also have lessons on basic stuff that'll be useful in many songs you play later. I highly recommend this. You'll see results ONLY if you put in time every week. Every day would be even better.
Honestly yes it is worth it. You get ALOT more content on the new one and the second one is more of an upgrade to the Rocksmith product rather than just a sequel. Definitely get the new one you won't regret it
Epiphone SG junior is a good beginner guitar and can be bought for about $110 shipped on amazon. It's a simple light guitar with a single humbucker pickup and an easy to play low action neck.
The actual game will only come with an air guitar, this guitar will only exist in your imagination and does not plug into any systems but your mind (advantage is calibration is not required and neither is tuning). For a physical guitar you can either buy the guitar and video game bundle or purchase the game and guitar separately.
7-8 foot you can get a double female and another guitar cable from a music store and go all over the house
Yes you can just change your settings before playing on multiplayer as long as you have it on the same console and 2 cables you should be good to go
It does have bass.
Its pretty easy to use on the PS3, never tried it on a PC.
No as per my knowledge, but some ubisoft PS3 can be upgraded by purchasing some activation code like Assassin Creed IV, pleas see the link below http://youtu.be/q2_G6Pthje4 I hope that helped enjoy
From what I understand two people can plug in and play on the same system. Two cables are required to do so and you cannot play online with someone.
No forseeability plans to make a 2015 Edition.
No you do not have to have Kinect. However if you do it allows you to use voice to navigate the menus. I personally do not use it I just use my controller and is does not affect any of my gameplay experience.
If your cloud has space then a hard drive would not be needed. I so far have only saved progress so that would be handled by the cloud system. If you do not wish to get a hard drive and want a physical copy of the files then saving to a flash drive inserted into the console is possible.
Yes you can
We bought my son in law both. He likes this one a lot better
Yes, you're asked if you wasn't too play left or right handed. I'm left handed and it works perfectly fine
When I tried using the Kinect I found that it picked up hand motions only causing confusion. I'm sure it works better for some and I was looking forward to never having to take my hands off the guitar but it didn't work out for me.
Only when you're playing it. Once it's in tune, based on the quality of your guitar, it should stay tuned. To that key anyway. When I change key in the game it automatically prompts me to tune it and the tuning feature is actually quite helpful. Usually takes less than a minute with my guitar. Hope that helped.
No amp is required, you do, however, need the cable, the cable is hooked up from guitar to xbox and the sound comes thru whatever you have hooked up to the tv, be it the speaker system or tv itself.
Yes it can. At least I never installed it. You will need memory to save of course.
It's a membrane styled board. It's a great board though. Highly suggest unless you just have to get a mechanical board. You'll need to get into the Corsair Vengeance product line if you're looking mechanical.
Yes
No they do not. If you have any cheap keyboard sitting around (rubber dome), the key press feels the same.
Up until now I have had no problems with setting up or transitioning with the less. They stay as bright as you set them constantly.
No, the texture is the same on all the keys.
This is one of the more customizablly comfortable keyboards that I've used. There isn't really any noticeable insufficienties with it, but it is a little high for just to play minecraft. I recommend a steelseries Gv mechanical keyboard at the most if you're adamant on a mechanical keyboard.
The K50 Has two I believe. I would recommend to look at unboxings
I would think so. I use mine for mapping keystrokes as a sizzle button and works great. As long as you can input the characters its should work fine. :D
Yeah it is, but I found it to be quite a bit more comfortable with it on.
About an inch.
I'm shocked people answered yes. Check out the lyrics to "blurred lines" and "c'mon" just to name 2. They are both very sexual...I wouldn't consider that appropriate for kids.
Regular wii gaming system, I am unfamiliar with what PAL or NTSC terms.
The United States version of just dance wii game will not work on Wii console purchased in Europe. Also wii console purchased in the US can work in Europe only with a converter because of the voltage. Most plasma TV especially the ones with wifi sold in the recent time can play pal or NTSC without any problem. So I bought my wii console and all the games in the US, works perfectly in Europe with a converter and the tv bought in Europe.
No
Yes as long as all of the wires fit into that specific t.v it's fine. Enjoy!
Yes, My 3 yr old daughter loves it! If they love music and love to dance they will enjoy this. It also has music for their age which is a plus.
I wish I knew, but I'm not sure. I bought it for the original Nintendo Wii, so I have a feeling it is not compatible.
No it's not.
Hi Mandy, Unfortunately, I don't recall any curse words but they are the actual songs word for word. If you don't feel comfortable with purchasing this specific one, purchase "Just Dance for Kids 2014". I'm sure its just as good.
Yes

I've taken my pouch to gamestop to when they had n3ds xl to demo. It fit perfectly fine, even with a bit of wiggle room. I was able to put the n3dsxl into a felt pouch and still fit it in the case. You should have no issues.
Yes, there is plenty of room for both the 3DS XL and the AC adapter! There's also two slots for games too.
No it can be attached to a belt using a carabineer but on its own only has a small metal hoop attaches to the back of the pouch
The case has two sleeves inside that will hold two games. From how I have used it, I put the 3ds in the big pouch and there is plenty of room in the middle of the case for other items, such as cleaning cloths, the charger, or another small case for more games. It's up to you. I hope this helps : )
There is a small elastic pouch inside the case where the DS sits. It should be held snug enough in the pouch so it might slide up and down inside but be protected by the cloth inside.
I had the same question, so I poked around and looked for the actual dimensions of the case and of the New 3DS XL. If I'm reading the dimensions right, there's still plenty of room. The New 3DS is slightly bigger than the regular one, but there still should be room.
It's pleather.
I would say this case has 3 sections - the 'back' and the 'front'. The back one is the snug one and fits the 3DS XL perfectly without a strap on it. The front section is exposed a bit more and currently holds my MH4 Card case perfectly. It can also hold the charger, headphones and other items of you choose to have a smaller card care (or don't take one at all). Hope this helps.
Yes
As far as I know it does.
Yes you do. You can control the menu and things with the controller but the actual gameplay is all about your own movements.
The kids say its better!
Hi Asam Unfortunately, I bought NTSC and it did not work. But I have bought before PAL and it worked fine .. So make sure it reads PAL on the cover compatible.
well... yes. I suppose you have kinect; because you must have to play
No I that will not work but they have been putting up some DLC from that on Just Dance2014. So yes and no I guess. I'm sure they'll put more from the past JD4 on this one as time goes on.
Not work!
We have 100's of different games on amazon.
I am sorry but that was bought for my daughter's group home and I have never used it. Wish I could help.

yes there is a port mic jack on it so you can listen to music while you game. There is also Bluetooth if you wanted to use that to listen to music through your phone.
Check your headset controls. Update console AND the headset by going to Turtle Beach website.
yes comes with alll the leads ect all id advise is to buy a better optical cable as the 1 it comes with is really flimsy :)
Yes with a blue tooth adapter
Yes, it does
Yes it does if your PC's sound card has a digital output (toslink/optical) a line out analog output (RCA).
They are actually pretty similar. The Phantom is newer and should have slightly better specifications, like the processor is much faster, but you are unlikely to notice too much difference. It may come down to which color scheme you prefer. They are both compatible with an Xbox One if you get an adapter, and with the PS4, but you need to purchase a talkback cable for the Tango while that cable comes with the Phantom. That is $17 you don't need to spend if you get the Phantom.
Mine did, factory sealed
Diane, you would also need to purchase an Xbox One Headset Adapter made by Microsoft to use this with an Xbox One. With the adapter it willwork perfectly with the Xbox One.
Not sure about PS4, everything needed was included for my XBox 360.
No. The Xbox one sends audio via wireless to the controller, then to the headset. Xbox 360 does not provide audio to the controller except voice chat.
It is wired into the controller. It does not require battery's and will run off the controllers rechargeable battery's
unfortunately no you can not hear your self through the headset
Yes, you can listen to game and TV at same time, when the tv is "snapped", and you can also listed to your xbox live party at the same time. One word of caution: the controller currently converts game audio to stereo (NOT surround sound). There may be a patch to fix this in the future, but who knows. There are 2 icons on the left of the adapter...the top is the controller icon that controls the game volume, the bottom is a person icon that controls the chat party volume. If you hold the chat icon for a couple seconds, it will mute the game volume; if you just tap one or the other, you can volume up or down the selected line.
You need to get the new version, the XO SEVEN Pro, to get mic monitoring. We just added it to the newer models of the XO ONE, XO SEVEN Pro, and XO FOUR Stealth.
You can with the second cable provided. You can also use that cable on a computer too. It is just like any normal headphone jack.
Yeah, very comftarble and excellent quality, I as a gamer I highly recommend them.
Yes it is
Make sure your controller is updated ...
It should. The headset doesn't plug into the console/TV at all. It's a regular stereo headset, and it comes with an adapter for the Xbox One controller. The only cables plug into the controller, and there's a spare more suited to another device like a phone or laptop.
Unfortunately no. Need to run the cord at all times. But this is a great headset has alot of uses
Yes. You just have to buy this...
Yup. I use them frequently with my PC. Just plug the USB and microphone jack in and you are good to go.
The headset has a 3.5mm "4-pole" plug hardwired to it. It is not designed for use with cordless landline handsets, but will connect to most smartphones and tablets.
eBay or Amazon. This headset is not all that anyway. Not surround sound and the speakers are only so so. I would invest in a true surround sound headset to hear footstep and vehicle direction better.
Yes....you can use it with your phone ...or with xbox 360 or xbox one...
No..
Neil, you would also need an Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter made by Microsoft to use this with an Xbox One. With that adapter it is fully compatible.
Yes
I am use with XBOX 360 and noew we are connected to TV.

The same way you set up any turtle beaches, just put the red & white component cables from your console into the turtle beach ports & you'll be fine, the HDMI is from your console to your TV, that has nothing to do with the beaches. :D
amazon
Yes it's ps4 compatible
Play On Anything Go from a console player on Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 to a PC or Mac gamer to playing on your phone, tablet or mobile gaming device and back again with a quick switch of wires. 3.5mm, 4-pole auxillary cable, RCA splitter cable
If you mean the voice cable for the 360 then yes other than that I do not know
Yes it will.
Yes indeed. The inline amp has an input where you can connect any source using a 3.5mm jack. So you can plug in your phone, tablet, or anything else you just need the right cable. Fortunately it also comes with a 3.5mm mobile adapter cord and a 3.5mm to RCA plug adapter cord.
The Shadow uses a thick rubber coated cable. The next version up in this line, the Spectre, uses the braided cloth.
That depends upon what you are connecting it to. The user guide has diagrams for each possible configuration (http://cdn-assets.turtlebeach.com/products/396/shadow_usermanual_en_101713.pdf). I believe the cord on the inline amp is 16 ft. long, as it runs to the back of the console, and the others are all shorter.

Yes
Yes, it comes with the adapter.
If you are referring to the voice monitoring system where the headset plays your voice back through the speakers like on the x12, then no. This was a big disappointment, as I loved that feature on my x12's (my wife loved it more:) You can hear yourself if you talk loud enough, but that defeats the purpose. This was one huge letdown for me with this headset, as the playback feature on the x12's was perhaps the best feature of the headset.
No, it plugs into an adapter that plugs into the Xbox controller
The XO FOUR Stealth has a new chat adapter made by Turtle Beach that repalces the one made by Microsoft that ships with the XO FOUR. It adds more features. like mic monitoring, Bass Boost, and others ... you can read about it here ... http://www.turtlebeach.com/product-detail/pc-accessories/ear-force-headset-audio-controller/644
The headset connects to the included Xbox One audio adapter, which is then plugged Into the bottom of the controller. The headset itself uses a common 'headphone' plug.
Yes but leave it in a safe place so you dont lose it
Yes but it plays volume through TV also, have not figured out a way to mute TV sound and keep sound only in headset. It's a great headset though!
The XO FOUR comes with the original Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter made by Microsoft. If you want one of the Turtle Beach adapters, which add features like mic monitoring and Bass Boost and other presets you should look at the XO ONE, XO SEVEN Pro, or the Call of Duty Sentinel Task Force or Call of Duty Sentinel Prestige. Those headsets were all launched after Microsoft decided that headset manufacturers needed to make their own adapters. Up until the summer of 2014 Microsoft mandated that manufacturers use the adapter made by Microsoft.
Yes, It has the adapter for the controller.
Yes
Yes it can be used with the PS3. The chat function (voice only) works through the USB but if you want in game audio you'll need either a jack input or the component cable from your PS3. I just used a jack input so that I wouldn't have to lose my HDMI. It is the same method for the PS4 and PC if you are interested in those as well. In my opinion this headset is the best choice at its price.
I am not certain on all games, but a few I have played yes and some no. Thanks
Technically, yes, and it is very simple to set up. You must plug the USB into the PS4 and the headphone jack into the controller, then go to settings and change all sounds to go to the headset. The issue with this is that you must sit directly in front of your tv because the split in the cord is so short. I mostly use them with my laptop. I have been meaning to test if it is necessary to plug the jack into the controller. If it does work without that, then these work great with the PS4!
Yes, if you use it without the inline amp it will work fine
Not that I know of, no.
Yes it will work on a Wii U. Just unplug the headset from the inline amp and plug it directly into the Wii U's 3.5mm audio port. Easy Peasy. The Marvel Seven is a great headset, I actually use one at my desk every day for phone calls and video chat.
At the moment, I believe the only adapter on the market is sold by Microsoft. http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-One-Stereo-Headset-Adapter/dp/B00OIPOTYG/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1416942895&sr=8-2&keywords=xbox+one+chat+adapter&pebp=1416942902749 The Marvel Headset is really nice, I use it every day at the office.
No it's not removable.
definitely this
Comfort is good you just have to break them in first. They were tight on me out of the box but after a few nights of leaving them extended on a box that wasn't an issue. But comfort is really dependent on your opinion and preference. Sound is very good in my opinion these are better than the more pricey headsets out right now. The mixer is a bit of a pain to use though depending on what platform you'll be using these on. I got these for the PC and have to change some settings to get them to work properly. Lately I have been using them on the PS4 except the mixer will not work at all for me. Just the headset itself plugged into the controller works fine though.

yes
Yes, it has HDMI output.
Yes, we replaced the 4 gb with a 320 gb in 3 systems for my boys..all three work great
As long as you're going to play games of the actual discs, then yes 4 gigabytes is plenty good. If you are wanting to download games from xbox live and run them off a hard drive, then 4 gigs will not get you very far.
Yes
You don't need a proprietary Microsoft one. I ordered this Hausbell one, which was the cheapest available at Amazon, at the time: http://www.amazon.com/Hausbell-320G-Hard-Drive-Microsoft/dp/B00B0QONB0/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&qid=1417195335&sr=8-16&keywords=xbox+hard+drive -it installed very easily and automatically, and has worked perfectly. There are larger ones now available, and I'd guess other brands are just as good. In fact, my drive had nothing that identified it as a "Hausbell" drive -the drive looked totally generic. Note that this and other drives advertised and/or labeled as for the Slim, work fine on the 360E because the octagonal slots are identical.
As of this past summer, you are no longer required to subscribe to Xbox Live to use apps such as Netflix, Amazon Video, and HBOGo. The only thing you need the subscription for now is multiplayer gaming.
Yes you lost certainly can but not Blu Ray ones. Only Playstation 3 and 4 does that. And you can do Netflix and Hulu also.
4
I bought this one here at Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Hausbell-320G-Hard-Drive-Microsoft/dp/B00B0QONB0/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&qid=1417195335&sr=8-16&keywords=xbox+hard+drive, but today I'd get this bigger one that is now available: http://www.amazon.com/500GB-Hard-Drive-Internal-Black/dp/B00JJIJNB6/ref=pd_cp_pc_3. Mine installed easily and automatically, and works fine. Any hexagonal drive designed for the Xbox will work, and any that are supposed to be for the Slim (like mine) will work perfectly on the 360E.
Depends on the seller. If it's used... But it should.
It comes with the basic cords. If you like games in HD you gotta buy your own
I return this xbox because of the Region, mine is Pal because im in Europe. If you want to install games on your console you should go for more gigs otherwise buy one that you thinks its best for you!
This one for sure , better system for the $ the elite made noises and always messed up so get this
If you buy it brand new yes or you could just buy the headset seperately.
Unfortunately no.
This is worded kind of difficult for me to understand, but if you are talking about the simple headset that plugs into the controller, there is no need for an adapter. But if your wanting to use Turtle Beaches or other fancy ones, you'll need to buy the adapter from their company.
I haven't had the red ring since using this model. It has worked great for me. As to fixing things with this one, I am sure they have updated some things.
Ntsc is a video standard used in the usa Othet countries like brazil use pal format for video Any device for video like any type of playback device or even movies like dvds or actual games need to be of the correct format for your country and the device they have to match each other Ntsc player = ntsc dvd or ntsc game this will make them compatible. Hope this helps
This unit uses a hardrive configuration that goes in a slot. The hard drive is not on the side like the white xbox 360 models. The harddrive for this model is different than the sidemounted ones
The fee is for the Microsoft service. You can play games without paying for the service. But, you will not get full functionality available on the the xbox (video streaming, etc.)
No only for updates but not for playing watching movies listing to music you download from a music
The older model of xbox 360 you can but this one I don't know never tried it
Unfortunately there is no Blu-ray drive present with the console, so you will not be able to play Blu-ray movies with this particular console.
I would have to a yes maybe since it's also a xbox 360 but do I know for sure no so for now buy it and try it if it's work then it's a yes if not sorry
Yes, you can use a generic hard drive (with case and correct xbox 360 format) or original hard drive, both are on sale in amazon.com
No- that what I do. I don't pay anything
110 but it goes into transformer. Don't know transformer output.
You should be able to play games without internet, simply playing discs you've purchased. But you'd miss out on any updates your system may need.
No. Sorry I don't do international shipping.
No, it does not... it's the first that I've ever experienced a game like this - everything you do is online/multiplayer; however, there are the following features that give you the 'single player' experience. 1) Small Squads - the online players make up about 10 of the soldiers that are fighting on the field; there are dozens of 'grunts' and 'spectres' which are part of the program (much easier to kill like in traditional single player modes). They balance it out with the 'live players' so it's a good mix. 2) There is a traditional 'campaign' mode that you can play from start to finish, but again, it's always online and there's always 'live' players mixed in with the computer enemies. 3) The developer rolled out their new enhanced 'match making' algorithm which takes the learning curve frustrations out of the way, i.e. as you get better, they match you with better players and visa versa. There's a 'training' section but that's super basic stuff. The game is just awesome... your pilots are outfitted with special jump kits so, in addition to walking, running, sprinting, etc. you can jump and get these little jet powered boosts... and there's the ability to perform special wall running/jumping moves that changes the shooter landscape completely.. Hope that helps...
It should be, I live in Germany and it made it here.
I honestly think so, but I use my Xbox for all the apps and watch my TV thru it as well. I also heard that titanfall 2 will be available for ps4
Sorry, no splitscreen.
Doesn't hardly take any at all. I can't tell you exact amount but since there isn't any campaign it's drastically cut down
Barely any people play at all now
No, you definitely do not need either. You will need a headset if you want to talk to other players online. What you do need is a subscription to Xbox Live Gold because this game is 100% online.
No ranked matches are available at this time. However, there are updates made to the game all the time (they just recently added private matches) and I expect that to be a gamerype added at a future time.
I'm 18, and I've been playing this game for a while now. In my opinion it does not have really graphic content or strong obscene language, just a fun sci-if game.
This game does not offer co-op of any kind. You can only play on Xbox Live together from different consoles.
Yes
It has three save slots, autosave and you can save to the slots anytime you want.
No, you do not need to be online. As far as I can tell there's no online element. The only thing going online will do for you is update the game with any bug patches or fixes. It's not necessary to play.
No, it's just a remake of Fable 1.
It's a direct port of The Lost Chapters version of the game, only with updated visuals and sound + tweaked controls.
Yes
you don't get to look through eyes just from behind
The original Fable was not hands free, so this game is not either. That would be cool though!
It's a remastered version of the first game. New graphics, old game.
Nope
According to the official Xbox website, this product contains the following: "Contents: Rechargeable Lithium Ion Battery Pack and Charging Cable (9 foot USB to Micro-USB)." Hope this helps.
1400MAH
Other posters are completely incorrect. It does charge with Xbox off (assuming Xbox is plugged in), just as it advertises.
Scott is wrong you can charge this with a wall charger as long as the wall charger puts out enough amps, i.e. my iPad charger allows me to charge it but the smaller iPhone does not. hope this helps. I know you posted this a while ago and you probably already know the answer.
It does not, sorry! But you plug it right into your Xbox and can play while charging
Microsoft promised controller support for Windows 8 in late 2014. So keep trying and it will eventually work. http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/controller-pc-compatibility If you can't get it to work try the drivers from the link.
Roughly 8 feet. If that's not long enough try monoprice, but it wont have the fancy charging/charged light.
Definitely around that amount. I usually charge around once a week and it charges in about 1 to 2 hours.
No. I'm not sure what kind of rechargeable batteries you have, but I have tried this before with the energizer rechargeable batteries and it doesn't work because you can only charge them with the charger case thing that comes with the batteries. I'm guessing this can be applied to all rechargeable batteries. For some reason the usb charger won't recognize the batteries, and if they do charge it is a lie! Maybe this didn't work for just me, byt it's better if you just buy the battery pack. Much longer battery life.
No warranty. But check to make sure it isn't the weather or anything bothering the current of electricity
Super slim
Here is what u can do.u can get the last of us bundle 500gb witch is 270$.and yes u can play other games with the last of us bundle.
The counsel comes with 500gb and it comes with (gta v) and a 30 day ps+ membership
I ship from Tucson, Arizona
Its a disk& no you don't need internet to play the game . you need the internet for Netflix or to go online and things like that
Probably not. Refer to Amazon's customer service department for more detailed information on shipping and payment method.
no is free to play online
No defect that I know of. Since buying this system it has been a champ!
I'm not exactly sure what you mean, but the system comes with everything, and the gta v disc is the full game.
Yes. The PS3 plays PS3 Blu-Ray games, DVDs, PS1 Games, Blu-Ray movies, and CDs.
Yeah it may take a while but that should be ok. You'd have to buy the expedited shipping option.
5 V. 5, yes. MyGM, no. MyCareer, yes but it takes longer to level up your player without VC.
I'm playing on All-Star difficulty with 6 or 7 mins per quarter. I highly advise to try tuning the User and CPU sliders for best experience in singleplayer mode, mainly toning down CPU's superhuman abilities like high % of made FGs, and offensive rbs etc etc. If you want, you can check out this great website www.operationsports.com for more info about NBA 2K sliders settings in the site's forum section.
Yes, you can
Yes, you need to change your language system to spanish
The dunk contest and three point shootout are in the myCareer and myGM modes. In myCareer you can only do the shootout because of some weird glitch. Not sure about myGM.
I'm not sure I've only gotten nba 2k games because of my player mode
no but you can on 2k15
Yes you can. I think 4 players, if not more, can play on the same system.
yes it can be if you choose. very fun game for kids, men and even family time for father and son. hope you enjoy it

Nope, you just play with the Wii Remote sideways like an NES controller. Of course if you want, you could get the Pro Controller too.
No. Is only for Wii U
Nope, just an HD TV, the higher quality the better but you don't need it
You can literally use any controller: the old Wii controllers work as well as the standard one that comes with the Wii U. I prefer the Wii U wireless controllers they made for the system
This is certainly worth $50. You can buy it used for cheaper, too. This is just my opinion, though.
I never played Mario Galaxy. Mario 3D World has a multiplayer where the players who fall behind will automatically be put in a bubble to catch up with the player or players in the lead. I play with my nieces (3-5 yrs) all the time. They don't even notice the bubble bringing them along. Great family game.
This game is plenty of fun single player, the way mario games are made is that there seems to be a natural flow of running and jumping that is inherent in your very nature. This makes it seem natural to jump around as you get better and more used to the game. It is definitely a worthy purchase for any Wii U owner.
Some areas of the game require the gamepad. When you encounter those areas, the game will tell you how to switch controllers.
No. One person can use the GamePad, and up to three others can use a wiimote, classic controller, pro controller, or wii+nunchuck.
You can play the campaign with up to four players

Most definitely !!!
Like others have said, it's subjective. The music that people use to deter others from playing only appear in the early stages of the game and only once, yet they continue to ignorantly dismiss the rest of the soundtrack and thus the entire game itself in some sort of backwards thinking. The music is remixed like the usual fashion of Mario World and the original Yoshi's Island, it's very cheery, calming, or exciting depending on the level. The only way to know for sure how the music is, is to play the games itself because the music is all made to accompany the levels and they flow quite nicely together.
I'm sorry, Becky - no. Yoshi's New Island is only for 3DS and 2DS.
Yes
Yes, it is for a Nintendo 3DS handheld game.
This game has three save files. :)
My 5 year old plays it and hardly ever gets stuck. So I would say it is good
Yoshi has to rescue a kidnapped baby luigi while protecting baby Mario so the brothers can be reunited.

Yes it does, my son and I enjoy playing together.
Yes it does! That's what I use to play this game! :)
All controller options are supported
This game is for the Wii U, so it won't work on an older system. You can play Wii games on the Wii U however.
It works on Wii U's sold in the Americas only.
Both games are a bit challenging. I haven't completed Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze to assess the whole game, but I don't think Returns is any harder. If you thought the previous one was too difficult, you might not like this one either. I would recommend Super Mario 3D World as it is easier but a lot of fun.
The game is a 2D platformer in which you, as Donkey Kong, romp through lush worlds, reaching the end of each level, and facing difficult boss battles. Donkey Kong can run, jump, roll, climb, and pound the ground. He can also have an ally like Diddy, Dixie, or Cranky Kong to use powers such as hovering, a double jump, and bouncing.
If you buy it new it comes with a new club Nintendo code. If you buy it used there is a chance it will be missing.
Much, much harder. The game even borders on cruel at times. However, it is some of the most clever and ingenious platformer game design I've ever played. Plus, I'm a sucker for the music and style of the original games and this one manages to more closely capture the imagination of those games.
I have a 4 & 8 years old who love the same games and they love this game!! We play together and we teach them to never give up!!!!
Yes it does, my son and I enjoy playing together.

Yes it does. It came with it.
It varies by mini game. There are some that pit game pad player vs the others with remotes who use the television to play. There are others that don't use the game pad at all, if I recall correctly, and some that use the game pad flat on its back like an old school two player Pac-Man game. The game comes with a small collapsible stand that will hold the pad flat. Lots of variety to the way the mini games use the Wii U.
Yes
No, you must have a Wii U to play this game.
I dont know
It came with a remote. No stand.
No, it is only play with your friends.
I think you have to have at least two players. I know they will have NPCs to fill in for the rest.....the game is most certainly meant for kids...I play it with my kid sometimes just as a bonding thing....my kid just checked and she says you must have 2 players
Each player needs one Wii Remote, with or without Motion Plus makes no difference. You will also need the Wii U Gamepad for many of the games, often passing it around. All other controllers like Pro or Classic Controllers are, as far as I know, not supported at all.
No, this is no Wii Sports wich you can buy online at the eShop

Yes
It only works on Wii U. You can use Wii games on Wii U console, but you cannot use Wii U games on a Wii console. I hope this helps!
Yes, for many of the events it will be required.
It's quite different. Some events are the same as they are olympic events but there are far more different events than there are same ones.
4
no you will have to get the wii U remote with sensor
It uses both the wii u controller and the basic woo controller. You do not need the one sold with the game.
Yes, it can be played with more than 2 people also in some games.
You can play wii games on the wii u. You will have to save the data from the wii on a sd card and tranfer it to the wii u. Wii u has instruction on how to do it
My son - who owns/uses the game - says no, the board will not work because it does not have the Motion Plus built into it.

You can use gamepad, pro controller, wii remote (with or without wheel), or classic controller (and pro).
Usually you get pre-order games the day they are released. Except for Nintendo games, I'm on Amazon Prime and every Nintendo game in the last 2 years or so that I have pre-ordered have been shipped out the day or day after their release date (some were released on Sunday so they were shipped out on Monday).
As others stated, Wii-U games are only playable on a Wii-U console. The Wii-U however is completely backwards compatible with all Wii titles, Wii Virtual Console titles, and Wii-Motes/Nunchucks, except a few dance games/accessories that may require the GameCube controller ports. The Wii-U is not backwards compatible with GameCube games or accessories.
Yes, you must register Mario Kart 8 between 5/30/14 (12:00a.m. ET) and 7/31/14 (11:59 p.m. PT) on Club Nintendo and you'll receive a free download code for the digital version of one of four free games.
Yes, it will be compatible.
Amazon doesn't directly sell any Wii U consoles. It's all third party sellers. The bundle may show up at some point, but it won't be direct from Amazon in all likelihood.
Yes. You register your copy of Mario Kart 8 with Club Nintendo before July 31 to get the download. The registration code is inside the game case.
Unless you own an American Wii U it won't matter where Amazon.com ship. The console is region locked, so if you live in places like Europe, Australia or any PAL region, you won't be able to play this edition and will have to buy from a store stocking PAL games.
No. Only the Mario Kart 8 Wii U Bundle comes with a red Mario themed wheel. You can however buy a Mario or Luigi themed wheel separately. You can also buy the original white or black ones.
Regular Wii remote will work fine.

Definitely. You cannot play offline and the campaigns are just multiplayer games with a set map progression. Therefore if you are looking for a 'single player experience' this game does not have it.
You shoot pixel soldiers and robots with pixel guns until they fall over or blow up. When you sneak behind an enemy you can snap his or her neck. It's a shooter so of course there will be blood and violence, but it's nothing that'll traumatize him. As for language, he probably hears worse things during recess at school.
It's $24.99. source: http://www.titanfall.com/news/season-pass-and-digital-deluxe
You need one of the internal Xbox 360 hard drives. Get the official Xbox branded drives from Microsoft themselves. The 3rd party HDDS are lower quality and can get your console banned. USB devices will NOT work, not even external USB hard drives.
The version I received after ordering states NTSC in the location you see PAL on the cover. I cannot speak for Amazon however I'm pretty sure based on your location and the type of order that you will receive the correct version based on the address of your primary account information. If there is a problem with your order once received, I would leave the plastic wrapping on, contact amazon customer service, and exchange it for the correct format.
There is no split screen option, so you can only play one at a time. The profile for your play is linked to your xbox live profile, so as long as you and your father are ok with sharing an xbox live gold account, and stats, you only need one gold account. Please be aware that this game can only be played online with xbox live. There is no offline play available.
Its rated M for blood death and shooting. No sex. No you cant turn it off its part of the whole game.
I don't think you can turn off the blood. But yes, you can turn off the voices.
No, not that I am aware of
No, there isn't a game code. A used copy should be fine.
It's multiplayer online only. Completely lacking single player campaign or mode. You cannot even created a private match alone against grunts and spectres and even if you could you still need to be connected 24/7 to actually play any of the game including the tutorial. It needs Internet to be playable.
lol
Should not have any problems. I run it on 8.1
just purchase the game then your set, you don't pay for multiplayer
Unfortunately to my knowledge there is no option to turn off blood and gore, however the worst thing that will be witnessed is a 2 second scene that occurs when a Titan crushes a pilot. All you see during this move is a misty red cloud. Aside from that the game is actually pretty clean.
The best setup is with a keyboard and mouse. Mice give much greater accuracy when compared to controllers. Although you can play with a controller you might be at a disadvantage though.
Yep, I use 8.1 And I there's no problems
Honestly, I am not sure. But some period they gave us special offer for free seasonal passes and maps. I think you don't have to pay an additional membership for playing.
don't know about second, but it is totally online against others, and there seems no differentiation of platform, and there is a lot of hacking. great graphics and controls, but very short till it isn't enjoyable. At ant rate, there are plenty of opponents.
nope. Hard copy
Yes, there is a monthly fee but the game includes one free month
you don't need ps plus to play online you just have to pay the monthly subscription.
You can just hop in and play it. It has a different storyline and is not connected to the others. The only thing that is connected is some of the Class Jobs you start with and the Advanced Jobs you can unlock etc. It is a very fun game I have been playing since the Re-launch. Every class is fun to play just play what you enjoy best! Little tip if you have not done any of the content just say in chat that this is your first time etc and people will help you out.
You only need to pay one monthly subscription for the account, regardless of how many systems you use with that account, but you do need a PS4 copy of the game added to your account. As an existing PS3 user, you have two options: 1) You can purchase a PS4 copy of the game and register that copy to your existing Square Enix account (the same one you use from PS3). This would then allow you to log into the game from either system, your PS3 or PS4. As this involves another purchase of the game, you would also receive another 30 days of subscription time "free" (which is their way of saying "included with the purchase price") or 2) You can transfer your existing PS3 service to PS4. To do this, log into your Square Enix account at the MogStation, select "Playstation4 Upgrade", and follow the prompts. This transfer is free of charge (until the end of 2014), but once the transfer is complete, you would no longer be able to log in to the game from your PS3. (And since there's no additional purchase with this option, there's no additional 30 days, either.)
As far as I know (since I had signed up for an account when it was in beta) you do not. In fact, that's one of the highlights of this game. Unlike Elder Scrolls where you do.
No
Yes.
Yep, and with the PS3 version too! Just make sure you're on the same server (known as "Worlds").
You can play in any of the systems with your character and data, the only thing that is required is the license (code) for that system. same will apply with the expansion when its released. So to answer your question yes if you have Final Fantasy XIV ARR for PC and you buy the game for PS4 you can play on both systems.
i believe its 15 a month
Sure does, that's one of its major features. I play it with my child often.
Yes 2 players can play at the same time.
The portal and disc will not work on the xbox360, the figures will work across platforms. I have both 360 and the Xbox one and interchange the figures regularly.
characters are usable on any system, just depends on the game, newer games support all while older games support up to the games' release.
The game disk is also included
I believe so, yes. This is my first purchase, but my nephew has the trap team and those characters do not work with this.
It is wired. If it wasn't you would go through a lot of batteries. Trust me we have the ds version.
These are the starter pack characters. I'm not aware of any choices. They're included in the box.
I'm not sure about the portal, but I know the figures work with each game.

No, you can play with other characters like Kaito, Len Kagamine, Rin Kagamine, Meiko, Haku, Teto, Luka and Neru.
Menus are in English, yes. Songs aren't.
The songs Len has in the game are "FIRE FLOWER", "DREAM EATING MONOCROME BAKU", and a duet with RIN in "REMOTE CONTROL".
It's out of print.
This version of the game is in English, and the PS3 isn't region-locked, so don't worry, you can play it wherever you live. ^_^
Ashes to ashes is his only single the rest are all in a group singing
Nope. It's only for PS3.
When I bought the Killzone Bundle the PS+ came in the box.
It's for online play. It's not needed for browsing the web, netflix, and free to play online games.
No it doesnt.
Yes. And 1 Dualshock 4. Basically all included in a new PS4.
Yes, as I mentioned it comes with all accessories. Are you planing to purchase this console?
playstation plus will not be included
Subscription excellent PS4 has always innovated and renew each year, ps4 for me is the ultimate and Playstation plus.
This is the American version and is the 500GB model.
The ps plus membership was sent by e-mail not a card in the box.
I have no clue... maybe the setting are in Japanese and the us in English? Maybe.....?
Sure, just remember u need high speed Internet for updates.
Yes
500
It is worldwide capable.
Yes it does. I am from Australia so I just plug my power cord from my PS3, a standard figure 8 lead in and it works perfect.
The game came outside the PS4 box.
yes, we do ship to Canada
I bought this for my step son for Xmas and I really am not sure because I wasn't there when he hooked it up, all I can say is that he's very Happy with the system. Im positive it was one not sure if two were in it, sorry
One year
You can buy an Amazon warranty i think is around 60-80usd
actually I received this but no and it did have the blue ring of death but Amazon work with me and resent me a new unit ASAP with no other complaints I love my ps4
No. The PS+ is important for online gameplay. You must buy it new; or a new $50 ps+ card.
you can search on Amazon for used item and you should be able to find it
yes you can use it on 110v and 240v Source:https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/PlayStation+4+Teardown/19493
Yes
our standard shipping is $20.76 and it is in manufacture sealed unopened condition. once opened any issue must contact PlayStation directly
One years worth of online time
Yes it looks like it's in India. A quick Google search: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Instant_Game_Collection_games_(PAL_region) http://www.gamechup.com/ps-plus-indian-subscription-details-one-month-sampler-sub-added/ http://gamingbolt.com/sony-touts-playstation-plus-numbers-in-india
nope
It has vibration feedback, but not true force feedback such as you'll find in the Logitech G27 and higher-end wheels. Meaning it rattles and shakes, but has no "pull" like a real car wheel.
I don't know. I just have used it on my PS3 and my laptop. I can tell you that it works pretty good!
I don't know. I just have used it on my PS3 and my laptop. I can tell you that it works pretty good!
I'm not sure, I have only used it with PS3 games.
around (0 degrees it does not turn 180 degree. I use it on Nascar and a few other games with no issues.
It connects via USB, so as long as you have a USB port on your laptop, yes, it will work.
Yes. It is PS3 capable. It should have no problem!
works good for me on midtown madness. I use auto transmission and park brake on one of the paddle/levers. I am 50 years old and this is my 2nd wheel--broke the paddles on the first one (it was a Saitek?) this one is very good for the price but I am not a gamer. just use it for midtown madness and it works great. the accelerator pedal is a little upright (too tall). I only use accelerator hand brake/park brake and one of the toggle buttons for screen changes. there are other buttons but my game is 12 years old and has no use for them. I like the suction cups and do not use the clamps because they hit my knees under the slide out table (keyboard slider board under the desk) that i set the unit on. I bought for the price and was expecting crap but am very happy with it.
Yes is it. I'm from Chile, so it worjed perfect on Steam. Enjoy it!
I'm using an Xbox 360 controller and it works perfectly, no hassle. Just plug in and that's it.
Yes it is an actual steam game, not a non-steam game. Achievements and all the other Steam related things work fine.
I downloaded it through Steam and it works just fine with Windows 8.1.
Having Windows 8 should not cause any issues. Do you have Steam installed? If so, go into your steam folder, find the game, and run MK Launcher.exe(C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/MortalKombat_KompleteEdition/DiscContentPC/MK Launcher.exe) If this doesn't work, uninstall it and reinstall it through Steam, as sometimes the game attempts to launch before the necessary files have been downloaded.
Yes. U will get code for activation on STEAM. Just give someone this code.
hi, is the code. you need to download the game from your steam account after using this code. (sorry for my poor english)
Yes you can play the game offline, if you have 2 usb ports you can plug in 2 controllers and play against your friends as well &#128522;
I've played through Steam with friends, and works like a charm. Latency can be an issue if whoever hosts has a bad internet connection, but otherwise it's fine.
Happened with me too but I found a game Neverwinter that's free and have been playing for months now.
Yes is it. I'm from Chile, so it worjed perfect on Steam. Enjoy it!
I'm using an Xbox 360 controller and it works perfectly, no hassle. Just plug in and that's it.
Yes it is an actual steam game, not a non-steam game. Achievements and all the other Steam related things work fine.
I downloaded it through Steam and it works just fine with Windows 8.1.
Having Windows 8 should not cause any issues. Do you have Steam installed? If so, go into your steam folder, find the game, and run MK Launcher.exe(C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/MortalKombat_KompleteEdition/DiscContentPC/MK Launcher.exe) If this doesn't work, uninstall it and reinstall it through Steam, as sometimes the game attempts to launch before the necessary files have been downloaded.
Yes. U will get code for activation on STEAM. Just give someone this code.
hi, is the code. you need to download the game from your steam account after using this code. (sorry for my poor english)
Yes you can play the game offline, if you have 2 usb ports you can plug in 2 controllers and play against your friends as well &#128522;
I've played through Steam with friends, and works like a charm. Latency can be an issue if whoever hosts has a bad internet connection, but otherwise it's fine.

No. It is ran through Steam.
You can download it right now, but won't be able to play it until the 25th.
If you did and completed the game, you would be honored as a hero.
I don't see why not, all you need to do is check the specs of your surface pro and check the pc requirements of DS2. You may not be able to completely max it out, but it should run just fine
Yes it does.
People have reported that the game is playable on low settings with Intel HD 4000 chipset at 20-30 fps. I could not play Dark Souls 2 at 20 fps but others may be happy with that. Be aware that when pushing older hardware to its max you may get other issues like crashes, stutters, artifacts, or over heating.
It depends...if you like eye candy then yes. The game looks and runs amazing at 60fps. The content is identical though
If it's a usb controller, yes.
yo recin lo compre amigo cambia el producto o el cdigo que te den en steam y lo podrs jugar como si nada. Muy bueno el juego y bastante difcil por un lado.
It's basically the black armor edition only you don't get the exclusive metal case it's all digital.

yes
if you mean vibration, yes it does
This controller is one of the best I have ever purchased, but if you need to modify the button layout because you find it uncomfortable or counter-intuitive there are a few programs that will modify the button layout. For example, x360ce is a very simple program to use (I use it for all of my games). It forces the game to think that the controller is an Xbox 360 controller so it is compatible with any and all games that use that controller as it's primary means. Just drop it in the folder with the LEGO LOTR executable (.exe) and run it, basically. Note: This program is not endorsed by Amazon. Beyond that, this controller feels a lot like a PS2 controller. So if you like that "feel," you'll love this controller.
sadly i don't think there is one. you need to use the cd that comes with the package
I didn't look at the provided mini-CD, which I assume has the device drivers for Windows XP or earlier, because I don't have a DVD drive on my system and I've thrown out the CD. Someone else might be able to help you with that. There are a few free ones around the Internet, like joy2key, but I haven't used them personally. The MAME emulator seems to pick up and use the game controller just fine without them. I also only have a small number of PC games, but they either use XBox controller or can use the built-in Windows driver directly.
It works on my computer with Win8.1
It should as long as you are able to download motioninjoy a program that can be used with the controller as a driver to simulate ps3 or even xbox 360 controllers. so I would test to see if the application works with your device before buying if that is the only reason to get this controller.
Pretty much anything that is not locked to a specific game type
I talk to etekcity directly and they said it does work for windows 8 but not windows 8.1 or higher. If you like my response please follow TwistedSaiyan on twitter and like us on facebook and subscribe to us on YouTube because we are apart of a special beta test program with Etekcity.
Variable rate
No, but it runs 1080p native on ps4 where xbox one upscales to 1080p. People say you can't really see the difference, but the game developers did say there were occasions where the xbox one engine slowed down to keep up with 1080p 60fps upscaling
This is the physical version of the game.
Very much so!
No.
Yes a few
Nop
no way, go to all regiosn Pen !
The box says 49gb minimum.
It came with mine. I bought it last week.
I believe so yes, I played around with the controls once and I think there was a lefty option.
No.
It comes with instructions on how to program - no software necessary as far as I know - looks like a series of keystrokes. Love this keyboard so far. Only complaint I have is that it didn't tilt up enough for me.
When you plug in the usb to your pc/laptop they automatically light up !!!
The FN button next to the right alt key, push and hold that and then press the escape key while holding the FN key.
It's ok quiet not anything to loud! I think it's a great keyboard!
19.13"
They turn on a boot up, but go off after awhile, and F+ ESC does not work for me either. I'm about to junk it, wasted money.
I have the same issue, then I just unplug the cable.
It is NOT a mechanical keyboard, I don't know why people answer without knowing this. It is a digital nub sensor keyboard.
People need to stop answering questions that they have no idea the answer to. This keyboard is not mechanical. Most mechanical keyboards retail for over $80 minimum. This keyboard is a digital nub sensor.
Yes, It will work for any flight simulator, or for any game you would fly aircraft. The Wheel Stand is use to mount your hardware (Yoke. Rudder Pedals), and it does not matter what game you are playing. The Stand works perfectly and is easy to move.
YES YOU PUT IT AT ANY ANGLE YOU WISH.
No...if it doesn't say the wheel you are looking for in the title then it is not compatible with that wheel.
No
Wheel stand pro is a stand to mount other controls such as flight yoke or race car steering wheel to. All of the instruments are sold separately. The stand is very well made and will take a lot of abuse.
I sell the stand only. I do not sell the Saitek yoke etc. Here is a link that may be helpful. http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?showtopic=37064 Thanks, Lucy
Yes
No, I don't see how it could
This is just a stand. Not the whole set of hardwares.
Wheel stand Pro can certainly support the Rhino, if you can get the platforms to interface (sit the controllers on) to the wheel stand.
Yes the belt comes with it
Regular wii remote is inserted in belt.
You could have them hold the controller but it will Calculate their score/calories differently since it typically calculates based on the hip movement. But if you want accuracy then yes you'd need another belt
Yes
NTSC
This game works on the wii u an long as you have all the pieces that go with the wii u there is nothing additional needed to run the game
you can hold the remote
Yes it does!
I do this in my bedroom and its small. I have no problem. Sometimes I have to modify the motions but its only in travelling moves
I'm not sure bc I've never played world party on regular wii...the graphics on wii u are amazing
Yes, as long as the game doesn't require you to use sixaxis motion controls. This dose not have motion controls like the standard ps3 controller so you might have trouble playing games like sly4
It's about 8-10 feet.
This controller will work with any game that doesnt require motion function(like the original six axis ps3 controller is capable of) so games like Killzone 2 are going to be unplayable in sections(arming bombs and whatnot) GTAV is good to go, have fun
Not sure if you can use for ps4 its not wireless
I haven't found a deadzone on mine and I've been using it on BF4. I don't know if this is indicative of mine or not but I am pleased with my controller. It is very well built. I hope this helps.
Unfortunately, no. As far as controllers go, it has no advantages over the original PS3 other than comfort but even that is dashed because the tiny shoulder buttons sometimes pinch fingers.
It does. but pc doesn't read the button scheme like the other ps3 controllers. it reads it like a X-box 360 controller. In fact I don't have to customize controls for steam's rouge legacy, or even most of steam's games.
This is for the original Wii. The Wii version will work on the Wii U, but not vice versa.
Yes it's fun
Yes, the belt is necessary BUT it already comes included with the game. I found this out after I purchased an additional belt. I love this zumba though! Have fun!
It always plays through the entire song. If you're doing well, you get more background dancers and the scene lights up more. If you start doing poorly later on, the extra dancers will disappear and the scene will go back to the original style.
Yes, the belt is included.
I haven't done the Zumba videos. I like the game because it walks you through most of the steps, scores you based on how well you follow the steps and keeps track of your progress.
Yes, I have lost over 40lbs in 5 months doing the elliptical for about 50 minutes in the morning and doing a full hour of Zumba in the evening anywhere between 4-7 days a week. I was more consistentl with Zumba precisely because it was so much fun while getting a great calorie burn. Don't be too concerned about staying on beat, my motto was as long as I was moving I was burning and I lost going from a size 14-16 to down to a size 6-8 in only 5 months!
You don't really have to hold the remote, the video comes with a belt for you to put the remote in while working out.
It didn't, I already had one.
Yes it does
It doesn't but the keys are very responsive with the price considered.
RIGHT NOW
The keys light up. The letters also light up blue as well as under the keys. It's a pretty good mouse and keyboard I like mine.
Not on my Mac. The keys work, but the light won't. No problem on Windows though.
You can turn on and off the LED back light on the keyboard using the scroll lock button. The mouse is permanently lit; no on and off button. I'm not sure about the warranty.
Yea I like it that way but it's definetly not quiet
Not that I'm aware of, but in my case its the individual characters that don't respond.
Has a nice matte finish, some parts of the keyboard are glossy for looks but it doesn't look like cheap glossy plastic. Keys feel nice. Outside of the keys doesnt feel as nice as the keys but it doesnt feel cheap, its nice and sturdy. Looks good.
The Tactile feedback is great! Right when you press the keys it snaps just like a mechanical, also if you like the sound mechanical keyboards make you would like this one. I have never seen or used an EasyAcc keyboard but I think you would love this keyboard :D
They're about 6 feet long.
My daughter said the quality is FANTASTIC. I talk outside the room they are playing their games and the person on the other end can hear me clear as a bell. She said you can hear everything. They are well made. They are definately worth the price. There were 2 in the package and I bought 2. I gave them 1 and I have 3 put away. My kids were going through 1 headset every 2 Months. Maybe more. Un like the cheap ones you get with XBOX, which have only one side for hearing and they were cheap with the band around the head, these are like stereo headphones with both ears with cushions (real cushions not that cheap black stuff) and a Mic that has metal around the bendable stick part. All in all,this was a great find as far as I am concerned, and I am very happy that I purchAsed them. I'm sure you will be happy too !!
Sadly no. The speakers are used for listening to the friends you're playing with.
No it doesn't. It's part of the plug assembly.
Yes my boyfriends uses his with his wireless controller it works perfect he loves it but you need an xbox online account to talk but the mic is awesome I recommend this mic it came early and works
It has a volume conto on the cord. Slider wheel.
yes...only the wireless controllers...i don't recommend this item..They came in my home out right out the package broke...never got to use them
Yes
Small hole at bottom of controller. Under the bottom of where battery pack plugs in.
Yess it plugs in thee controller
I don't think the system matters because it's the controllers that you attach the headset to.
One short. One long
yes
It does it hooks up to the xbox controller and the computer so you can hear the game and chat.
yes it can
no actually I've been trying to get in touch with you guys because the mic does not work what can I do about that
Yes it does.
Go to Accessory Settings in the settings tab in the main dashboard. Choose the Audio Device Settings option. Change the Input Device to the dream gear option and the output device should automatically change to the input device.
Yes but I recommend you get something stress bend kinda sucks
Its alright I wouldn't get it again for its price.
It works on my iPod and laptop perfectly and on ps3 n xbox
Dragon Ball Z Attack of the Saiyans for the Nintendo DS.
1.) No unfortunately mission is like story mode, No open world. 2.) There is no Gathering Dragon Ball (only online to win, but no wish). 3.) No fuse/items to make new character. Recommend Old DBZ game like DBZ B3 or U.T
English.
I'm sorry to bring the bad news but yes, playing offline mode is single player only. The only way to play together would be to play online with another system and game :(
There is no Dub in Spanish. It only has subtitles in spanish.
I wanna say no because I believe they made a version for the PlayStation 4.
No it doesn't
Yes its in English
No. The Xbox one is not backwards compatible
No, it will not, different formatted disk.
Nope, sorry. He isn't.
In this game only super sayin 2 and 3 goku can teleport
This game doesn't have couch co-op or local co-op. Co-op is only available on Xbox live
I don't know, I gave this DVD to someone for gift.
Yes
Yes, I had to run it in compatibility mode to get it to run well and have better control the scrolling.
No. Though you can probably make them work if you really want to, you would essentially need to set up your controller to control a mouse pointer. These are all RTS strategy games (with the exception of "Renegade"). I can't even imagine any situation where a controller would be preferable to a mouse with an RTS strategy game. They were never designed with that controller in mind.
Hello Andrew, All games work on XP (sorry for my english)
EA Origin account required
I don't think the online servers are still there (I have never tried to access them) - CNC 4 may be an exception. You can play multi-player on an internal network.
I dont know but, found this info from KrittMasta, No, this is strictly working on Windows. Unless you run Windows emulator (Vine) or something on Mac, you can't play this game. You'll need a mouse to play. It would be very effective if you have a fullsize keyboard with it. Other than that, sorry.
I never got it to download from EA. DON'T BUY IT. Amazon will NOT REFUND YOU
They do work on windows 8, matter of fact, that's what I play them on.
There are 17 different titles to download. Each ranges between 650mb to 4gb depending on the title i think. I have not downloaded all of them at once... i hope that helps

3 separate codes.
Now, I'm not 100% sure, but I believe it will give you the option for pc or windows download
No, just the main games. I picked up the infinite season pass on sale for $10 right after I bought the triple pack. That was a few months back though.
I assume that as long as you have Steam and Windows, it should work.

Yes. ..I bought this product and works great try rapid fire and silencer
Well, Amazon sent me a different controller by accident but I'm sure MOST of the mods work
Honestly No it isn't my younger brother is better then me at it and he didn't find it any help ful, so no it isn't at all. And it's tooo expensive
Its working pretty good for me sometimes its a little slow on shooting but i find it usefull for me for those guns
Yes it those drop shot jump SHOT exc
you can redeem the code on a mac, but the game itself is NOT mac-compatible. Currently this game will only play on Windows.
Hi! You can use any pc available controller. I for one, use the 360 controller sometimes but my brother uses his ps3 controller and it works nice with both.
If you have a steam account, you should go to "Your Account" -&gt; "Your Games & Software Library", then just copy the product code, and paste it to activate the game on steam
Yes
Once you have it on steam it carries over to any PC you have.
Hi! It does. It runs almost with any recent processor with integrate graphics. From 2013 to date, any processor can handle FF VII graphics requirements. I had a core i7 from 2012 and no graphics card. The game runs perfectly! Hope you enjoy!
I have Windows 8 and it worked just fine for me.
You will download the steam client then follow the steps emailed to you
It is a game download. You have to have download steam and then you can download the game but it works great.
It's a digit game code for Steam to download the entire game.

Because XB1 sucks and PS4 is better
Yes
It has a campaign but you can't pay split screen with friends or play against bots either.
no it does not
yes, yes, yes!
Yes lots of people still play this i get to play full servers all the time which is 64 people max on the conquest game mode
honestly i dont know. bought it as a present
No
Unfortunately not.
U can play with the CD borrowed from your friend on your PS4. But if U are not going to use the CD/return the CD, Then U still have to download the game.U cannot install the game on your PS4 from a borrowed CD.
4 discs in two cases and a digital code for mega man 10.
You can download the digital games anytime you want it, the only restriction is that it is limitated up to max 3 consoles and the game is associated with the PSN account that used the code to unlock the digital content; if the game is used and the user used the code, you won't be able to download it to your psn account... btw: the game sucks :P (i deleted it)
Yes complete games good ofert
Yes it does supports trophies, since each Game comes in different disc, so is like having each Game separately.
Yes
No
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes it is, just download uplay and enter the key and boom you're in!
Don't worry it's a uplay code that you redeem through them
It does not work for Stream, only uPlau. You will have to create an uPlay account if you don't currently have one.
I don't know, is 'ghsoting' motion blurring? If it is, then I think so, I have it and never noticed.
I'm glad to help you with your question, but this kind of questions can be solved by a simple google search. PSP stands for Play Station Portable. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable

Yes,not problem
Yes, A PSP is a PSP! Just like ps3 game work in a phat and a super slim.
the whole game is playable with 2 people. I'm not sure about 3+. but it's super fun with 2!
Yup. Plays like all lego games but with dialog... Cool story line, tons of playable marvel characters.
The PS4 digital code allows you to download the game directly to your system.
No. Tried both settings on game and PS4. Sorry!
Honestly, I'm not 100% sure. I remember there are different language to select but not sure if German was available. I tried to search for it on the internet but I cannot confirm. I'm unable to confirm it as my house is under construction so my playstation 4 cannot be used at the moment.
I believe the controls are customizable but the defaults are (this taken from the manual): Directional Buttons/Left Stick : Move Character L1/R1 : Toggle between characters in free play Triangle : Change Char / Hold to X-form in to a big LEGO figure Square: Attack / Shoot / Hold to Aim Circle : Build / Use / Activate / Special Ability or Weapon X : Jump / Double tap to hover, double jump, or combat roll Right Stick : Move Camera R3 : Look / Rotate Map Touchpad : Map Options Button : Pause / In-game options Hope this helps you decide. It's a great game.
Yes. You are able to play with two characters and a third in tow, allowing one of you to switch to that third character depending on the task to be completed.
I doubt it for the audio in spanish. this youtube vid shows all you get in the main menu-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa8bUCqekwo No i don't remember needing internet access. I only used internet to connect at ps Vita as a second controller, but i've never needed a connection for any gameplay.
Yes. My kids love this game.
I believe it's only up to 2 players at a time.

Although I have no knowledge of those boxes I do know if they have micro usb audio output or bluetooth audio then it should work. If no micro usb audio out then perhaps an adaptor to go from phone jack to that? You'd have to check with a place like RadioShack to help you for such things. Also there's such a thing as phone jack to bluetooth transmitters. Hope that helps.
These hook up with Bluetooth and will play anything including telephone conversations and they also have a microphone. It doesn't matter what you play through them.
Yes...
Yes they Will connect to any other blues tooth device
I have worn mine in the rainrain with no ill affect
According to your radio device, if radio FM signal is good, then the sound will be very good.
Musicjogger just can listen to music with bleutooth device, not included with TF/Micro card, and sorry that aslo can not listen to radio station itself unless by your mobile phone
yes, can connect with multiple devices, just need to turn off previous device bluetooth, and then can connnect to another
I believe as long as you have Bluetooth in the Kindle it should work, then again I only used on Apple products.
The headphones are pretty tightly bound to your head for comfortable fit while running.
Yes
I would think so. But I wouldn't know for sure, I only have an XL 3DS. But I don't see why it wouldn't be able to.
It fits both.
It fits the 3DS XL, so it should fit the DSi XL
No you can not.
Nope, just storage.
Honestly I don't know. I've never put a regular sized one in. Sold mine forever ago. But I'd assume that it would be fine. From my memory the older 3DS, while smaller, was a tad thicker. And since this case has a strap on the inside that should hold it in place. And even then, if it did start moving around you could always try using one of those protective hard shell casings. Hope this helps.
A regular 3DS will, in fact, fit in this case. While it is designed with the XL in mind, it holds pretty firm so you shouldn't have to worry about too much sliding around. There are smaller cases for the standard size 3DS too.
Yes, that's what I got it for and it is a perfect fit.

And since this case has a strap on the inside that should hold it in place. And even then, if it did start moving around you could always try using one of those protective hard shell casings. Hope this helps.
A regular 3DS will, in fact, fit in this case. While it is designed with the XL in mind, it holds pretty firm so you shouldn't have to worry about too much sliding around. There are smaller cases for the standard size 3DS too.
Yes, that's what I got it for and it is a perfect fit.

Similar but just as good.
I am assuming you are talking about the puzzel code that pops up through out the game. Once you solve one of these it usually gives you access to Cameras which allows you to hack certain areas. Some of these codes are relatively easy and some are not (they get tougher as you progress through the game). I was lucky enough to score one of the Limited Edition Hardback guides (almost 3" thick) and it goes into great detail on each of the individual codes and shows you exactly how to complete them. Without this guide I would have been completely lost. This is one of the most intense games that I have ever owned and takes a great deal of patience to play but very satisfying at at the end. I hope my comments help.
The thing with this game is that, as an open world game, you pretty much dictate what to do. If you follow the story you will be given specific missions and cutscenes are expected, but if you dont you can pretty much create the mayhem you want and be chased by the police. Besides it, there is a mode to use a giant mechanical spider...pretty cool. It is not by any means an alternative to GTA or Saints Row as it is not as polished and structured as those ones. but its pretty fun.
you can't afford ps plus?

Yup!
It clicks as you scroll
Yes it does make a slight clicking noise with all buttons. Its somewhat quieter than most and definitly quieter than just about every keyboard I have owned but you will eventually not even hear it all after a short while. The buttons have a nice feedback feel to them and if you have small hands such as I because I am a shorter person than average the mouse will feel a little big to you but all in all I like it.
On my mouse i can it has options for 125 hz. 250hz 500 or 1000 in the settings menu
No sorry
Its a regular palm mouse. I threw it in the trash 3 months ago because it stopped working after 6 months. Its the same size as the razor epic chroma mouse that I now have.
The dpi is set to a specific color by default. You change te default colors and dpi by pressing the dpi button on the mouse. You can customize the colors by using the software that is included.
http://www.utechsmart.com/index.php?s=/Download
You can change the colors via software as you like.
The mouse has a DPI button below the scroll button and you get to choose what speed you would like your mouse to move at.
Yes
Yes, there was an adapter that came with the ds.
Yeah. It comes with a SD Card, charger and a stylus.
USA
You can.
as of May 13, 2014 (5/13/14) the firmware version is 7.1.0-16U
I don't think so. It's discounted and the pictures don't show the second analog stick on the right. I guess Amazon isn't selling it before it launches on the 13th.
No it cant play them. Only plays DS, DSi, and 3DS games. But some games have been rereleased as a game for DS. Example the classic sonic the hedgehog games got released as "sonic classics" a DS tittle. "Namco museum DS" is another good DS game, it rereleases old arcade games like "galega" and " Pac-Man".
That depends. If you bought them from a normal local vendor (one based in the US), they will almost surely be from that region. However, if you buy them from a pawn shop or from a person, it is possible they won't be. This has never been an issue for me since the dawn of video games. I do suggest that you simply be careful when purchasing games on websites that are completely in another language as it is very likely the games will be from another region. My brother made that mistake and assumed the game would work on his English version console. Considering that the game was only released in Japan though, it should have been obvious.
Yes
why would you even ask this? it's a "retro" version of an old school game gear. not everything needs facebook or wifi lol
My girlfriend ordered it as a gift. From my understanding. It's a standalone handheld sega. So no sega games needed they are on it. Hope it helps
No, if u want multi system emulation get the JXD-S5110b. Just type it into Amazon and you'll see the PS4 clone that emulates multiple systems from the 8 and 16 bit eras, I think it does N64 also
My sealed box states a production year of 2013 on the box label. I do not know what year it was first produced. Maybe check out the company website, www.atgames.us, for more information.
No
Not sure, but way more efficient than the emulator on my phone. Lower power needed for display, I suspect. Great back seat entertainment device for road trips.
read the reviews.
You can use a small one. The rom files are tiny by today's standards. I think no more that a gig is needed, you could even get a considerable library of games onto 256k or 512k. g\Good luck finding one that small nowadays, though.
This was a gift but I think the games were built into system
It's not a built in game, no.
I forgot to tell you that I was using a splitter on mine. The head set plugs into the controller for power no batteries for the head set. But the part that plugs into the controller has a 3.5 plug on. Because you can unplug the head set and plug it straight into your iPhone and it works. There is also another cord Polk sent me for free that is for use with a phone and it has a built in mic... Hope this helped a little.
yes, it comes with an adapter that plugs into the controller.
I believe it will I've watched movies and Netflix with them the only problem is the controller shuts off if you don't move the joystick or press a button every 5 min or so and if that happens you will not have sound.
No just through the controller but you get dts sound quality
Actually they will call you and confirm you received the boom mic
Honestly, I didn't see any difference
My worked just fine but it was horrible having a cheap add on mic to a beautifully made headset with pop up mic which didn't work, so I don't want to use it any more... I have since spent 200 more to have a headset work as intended (Sennheiser G4ME ONE)
I can't you an absolute yes or no, but all I know is that you tend to talk louder cause you can't hear yourself talking. The headset is awesome, the clarity of the sounds from the game is over the top. Plus you can hear things like the phone ringing or that someone wants to talk to you is great. Hope this helps.
I never got anything. I think they've stopped caring. It would help if they showed what it looked like. I even called them, spoke with someone who said I'd get an email with tracking but I never got anything.
I wondered the same thing! From polk customer service: "If you look at the bottom of the feet, there is a rubber pad. Simply pull the rubber pad back, it's held on with double sided tape. Once they're removed, there are 2 screws that hold the foot to the bar. It's that easy!"
It should. I have one and I connect it via optical audio.
I would say its less than 10lbs....shipping is under 15 lbs with all of the packaging
There are no issues I have a PS4, and it works great with it.
modes? Do u mean halo, forza,movie? Use remote or function buttons on soundbar
Check this link out: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_response
I don't believe it will work as part of a surround sound setup. The input is optical and so I don't believe you can setup the amp to output via the optical port the centre speaker.
No
This one is great for everything, in my opinion, I watch a lot of action movies, space battles, and it delivers.
It has feet at the bottom to allow it to sot on a table, but it does have portrait slots on each side to allow it hang from the wall like a picture
16gb
Yes. There is a micro SD card port in the back that supports up to 32 Gb. 64 GB microSD comes with exFAT format that is not supported on any android system. If you want to use 64Gb, you need to format the 64 GB microSD card to FAT32 using your PC or Mac computer.
I've never had a problem with mine.audio works great
I bought this expecting not to use it much i just like hand held games , I got it to stream from my pc which works very well , however i didnt expect to be playing android games on it , but i find myself playing them all the time . I also use it as a emulator through android apps so now i have access to all the games for older systems such as n64, nintendo, psp, playstation, sega ,just about anything you can find an emulator for also i can hook up the xbox 360 wireless dongle and hook it up to the tv and play multiplayer games like twisted metal, or i can just play my computer games on the big screen in the living room it all works very well, they keep it up to date and are adding alot more features like pc streaming outside of youre home network. I would never hesitate to buy another one and ill buy any newer versions they come out with. there is also a nvidia grid feature that they are testing which allows you to stream games from nvidias server and it works great with my internet connection and is free to do right now they have several good titles, this is by far the best quality hand held you will find i didnt think the controller would be very comfortable because it looked weird in the pictures but it is a very comfortable controller . needless to say I love my shield and would recommend it to anyone.
The GPU is an Nvidia GeForce ULP (Ultra Low Power) with a total of 72 cores (48 pixel shader cores, 24 vertex shader cores) and 4 graphics pipelines. "Tegra 4" is the name of the SoC (system on a chip), which contains the CPU, GPU, memory controller and I/O controller.
The best games for NVIDIA SHIELD that I like are GT Racing 2, Asphalt 8, Dead Trigger 2, Modern Combat 4, N.O.V.A 3, Fractal Combat X, Minigore 2: Zombies and Virtual Tennis. All of them are totally controled by Nvidia Shield...
You can play some Android games offline that don't require an Internet connection. It does support the Android steam application, but I don't think you can launch games from the mobile steam application.
It has been 1 year since your question, but I felt it necessary to post that Scott Beeson, the previous poster to answer your question, is wrong. The NVIDIA Shield is designed to do exactly what you described.
No. You need the screen up even if you aren't going to use it (HDMI-Out Only) as when the clamshell is closed it covers up the buttons on the top.
Yes, its still worth it, its still I awesome piece of hardware. I personally dont really use the game streaming feature a lot, but I love the attention it gets me in public. People are always like wow what are you playing on.

If you're asking if it comes with a DVD player to play the PS3 games you can buy at your local store (as well as DVDs and Blu-rays), yes. If you're asking if it comes with a hard disk drive, no it doesn't. You can purchase a hard disk drive for it, along with a frame that holds the drive and allows you to screw it into the console, which is what I did. If you don't buy a hard disk drive, it is limited to 12 GB of internal memory, which won't let you play more than one or two games at a time.
Only the first generation PS3 consoles can play PS2 games.
It has no hdd. The 12 gb is internal memory. You can install your own hdd as long as it's 2.5''. You also need a mounting kit so your hdd will fit properly
I do not know the space requirements for that game, but you can look at the back of the game case or google your question. Either way you will use up that 12gb really fast with system updates, game updates, and save files so i would still invest in a internal hard drive. Not an external hard drive as you cannot play your games off of the external.
Power cord, S-video cable and usb charge cable for the controller. No HDMI cable though :(
The PS unit does, but to buy an individual controller at a store or online, no.
Only older model PS3 controllers
I assume you're talking blu ray movies. Play them? probably, display them correctly? I mean the ones encoded at 25fps that aren't region lock, I don't think so but I've never tried them myself. For Region B locked Blu rays no unless the console is the pal version. Region Free I'm pretty sure means for games only, there is one game I know of that is an exception to this rule: Persona 4 Arena. In short no it will not play Pal encoded Blu Rays nor display them correctly.
It comes with one wireless controller
On all the ps3s there are only 2 USB ports, but you can plug in a 4 port USB hub and have all 4-5 controller's working. Actually the ps3 supports up to 8 players but good luck finding a game that will support 8 lol Wireless is up to 8 controller's also, you can of course combine wire and wireless.
You plug your lightning to usb cable just like you would with a wall charger. It should work just fine. To charge the moon stone's battery you use the provided micro-usb to USB charger to plug into your wall
The key is a headphone wrap and the fish is a cord wrap.
I charged mine with an outlet...not computer..took a couple hours. And I only used it until I could get my phone or iPad to a regular charger
You would use your iphone 5 usb cable
You can use both ports ... I have had 2 phones charging before at the same time
Yes.. works with anything that has a USB cord.
My iPhone 4s works fine with it, and I think it should work with an iPhone 4.
I havent charched a tablet with the Lepow series 3000mAh. It perfectly works with my cell phone.
We'll I don't own a LG phone anymore I can imagine it would work just fine if it uses a micro USB port.
it takes a couple hours only

It isn't free-spin, and it does have tactile feedback of the scrolling. It's not as pronounced as some mice that have more of a ratcheting feel to them, but it should be fine for fps gaming. I use it that way myself.
Yes, A very good manal.
Yes there is. Underneath the battery cover there's a place specifically to securely store the USB dongle.
No, it's a unique receiver that's not compatible with other Logitech products. The K750 uses the Logitech unifying receiver which is compatible with a range of Logitech products that supports unifying, but there are no Logitech gaming mice that support unifying receivers currently. Net, you'll need to use both receivers with that keyboard and mouse combination.
The Price.
Yes they are very easy to push down and all buttons can be pushed pushed from just about any angle this also includes the thumb buttons. Up down left right but thumbs requires more push as it would interfere with pressing them if it were any easier you would get miss press's.
If I understand your question, they're mechanically clicky (you hear a 'click' sound).
Nope. I have a glass desk and bought this and still have to use a mouse pad. It's a great mouse and I still like it, but it does not work on glass.
Yes, it supports this function. Through the Logitech Gaming Software, you can assign any button of the mouse to "Shift DPI" function. You choose the button and the DPI you want. As long as you press the selected button, the mouse operates to the specified DPI.
The scroll will is click stop but very smooth , new experience from logitech. You can't control it like the MX
We bought ours from Premium Controllerz. They send us a detailed email with all instructions. Sure they would you as well. Just ask through Amazon.
yes
It is decent. A friend of mine has a faster trigger finger. But it's still good for people who don't have a tringer finger
Yes you can.
Not every game but most cod games it does
Yes
Those are bolt action snipers. So it wouldn't work at all. And mods don't work well on BO2 anyways
Yes it is amazing for every game easy to use
The controller itself will work, but the modded portion will probably not work due to the game being in 3rd person.
Yes
Improvement, especially on the looking
As long you use a computer with a USB port, and mouse compatable then yes.
It is wired. Braided cable btw
It sounds normal like any other mouse clicks and you will get a wired mouse no doubt. It works very well.
Yes comes in original box.
This works perfectly windows 8
The lights turn off when you shut your computer off completely. Putting your pc on sleep does not turn off the lights.
No,there aren't,this mouse is plug and play
Can't really compare this to the type R as I don't have it. It's a solid mouse for the money though. What I can tell you as far as weight is concerned is that it's seems slightly back heavy (perhaps because of the "balance ring" which is the thumb catch towards the back), but for the most part pretty well balanced. My only real complaint is that I wish they would've elongated the "balance ring (thumb catch)" a little more. I find myself sometimes sort of running over my thumb with this. But for the money, I would recommend it!
You can get it in both. Just double check which one your ordering.
Hey, lopez. The game is the cartridge only thing you can do online wise is check out other player scores on a scoreboard.
There is a very brief scene in the game where you see a woman button her shirt and a man zip up his pants in an attempt to imply that she was trading sexual favors for medical supplies. There is no nudity.
no it already comes with all the chapters of season one plus the 400 Days DLC(special episode)
it looks great! runs smooth just like the console. Ive seen some pretty bad vita ports. (god of war collection and sly cooper: thives in time) but this game and PLaystation all stars are amazing on the vita.
Unfortunately, no. I wish there was though. I would have liked to use my ps3 season 1 save to continue season 2 on my Vita.
Its not that bad of a game i mean its not like he is asking for dead space on a playstation 3. However you are doing a great job at parenting seeking help first before buying him a game. I think it is rated mature. I would say let him play it 12-16yr olds i think should handle it just as well as a 17yr old. Ive played mature games since i was a young kid and theres nothing wrong with zombie games for a 12 yr old. If youre a really cautious parent though then no he would need to wait a few more yesrs
Yes it also plays on the Wii U. Played it this morning. :)
Yes
zumba kids states it is for use only in the USA, Canada, Mexico, and Latin America. I did not see any marking to indicate it is a multi 5. I hope that helps.
I think there are a max of 4 score keeping slots at any one time, I have done it with 3 kids at once. But if you have enough room to move about it is the movement that is fun not the score keeping, So if they like "dance" it is fun to move along with out keeping score, and it is a work out, so taking turns or in other words resting, is certainly an option and there are enough slots to keep track of everyone's score.
No, you need to play it on Nintendo Wii with controller. The game checks to see how much the controller movement matches up with the movement on the screen to award points.
Yes, it plays in the Wii mini.
No. Not at all.

Only Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim have Steam keys. Arena, Daggerfall, Morrowind (inc. DLC) and Oblivion (inc. DLC) can be installed via CD/DVD without the need the need for Steam, Skyrim however requires Steam activation before you can play, even if you install via DVD. (It should be noted that Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim plus all DLC are on ONE Steam key.)
Bethesda answers this here : http://www.bethblog.com/2013/08/07/the-complete-elder-scrolls-collection-comes-to-pc-this-september/ "For Oblivion, this means that the **disc** version of the game does not include the smaller add-ons (Horse Armor, Fighter's Stronghold, Mehrunes' Razor, etc)... more on that below." "As a bonus, the included Steam key will activate Steam versions of Morrowind GOTY and Oblivion GOTY Deluxe. Like the disc release of Oblivion, the deluxe versions include the main game, Knights of the Nine, and Shivering Isles, but it also adds English versions of the Wizard's Tower, Fighter's Stronghold, Orrery, Thives' Den, The Vile Lair, Mehrunes' Razor, and Horse Armor. These add-ons are not compatible with the disc version of the game, so you will need to use the Steam version to access them."
Yes, I have 8.1 as well and all the games run fine.
You only need to download steam for skyrim i believe and once its downloaded it should ask for skyrims activation code
Just over 16" x 20"
Hey Ashlan you can still play your game it downloads everything and will continue with your game. You will not lose anything. I hope that helps.
why not just not install skyrim? they come on separate discs
Sadly no. Its a PC only.
These are all windows games, so they will work on 7. (If you you have a non/ low gaming pc run skyrim in low) Skyrim, and Oblivion have it opted in to using a xbox 360 controller, morrowind might have a mod out to do the same. As for Arena and Daggerfall, you only really need the keyboard, as the mouse is optional, these games simply can't be played with a controller.
Sadly, no. You can find digital copies in .pdf format at manuals.bethsoft.com, however.
Yes Halim S. I have used it in two separate countries since I bought it. Currently, I am in a country with electricity rating 220 Volts, alternating at 50 cycles per second. That means this device does accept 220 Volts at 50 Hertz, and you do not need a voltage converter. It has multi-voltage support, just like the PS4. It is definitely "plug and play" anywhere in the world. Enjoy your purchase.
I've had these charging stations on the PS3, and according to Energizer when the controls are already charged, the LED lights are on, but stop charging the batteries. And it really works, because I had four controls, and they worked perfectly until sells them.
No, the USB is different. Mini vs Micro USB.
Yes. I live in North America and the charger works fine.
The adapter works on both currents.
Yes, it does.
Yes it will as long as the silicone isn't too thick.
Yes
I bought this device in order to avoid let on mY PS4 more time than I expected. This charger for me is very usefull, becasue let you charge two controllers at the same time. However, if you have just one controller, maybe it is not a good idea.and about the time, for me is very fast.
The lights are off when there is no controller attached
All 1.0 characters are playable on 2.0, but playsets are not compatible so you can only use the characters in ToyBox mode.
Characters work on any platform. Infinity bases are platform specific. Example: If you purchase Infinity for Wii and decide that you want to move to an XBox360, you will have to buy Infinity for XBox360 but you WILL NOT have to repurchase your characters.
Yes
The figurines are sold alone. The packs are sold with two characters and two power discs. The play sets are sold with two characters and their own "world" to play in.
Yes, all the infinity characters are designed to cohesively work together. It is kind of neat to see a Marvel character and Elsa cohabitate the game, she has similar powers to Iceman from the X-men
Yes, as I live in Australia. I have brought the item and it works here.
Its for 1.0 but can be used on the 2.0 in the toybox
Yes
Yes
No it does not play on the original Wii. To play Infinity 2.0 characters you need to change to a X Box 1 or a Playstation 4 or the Wii universe (or whatever the latest model is called).

Characters work on any platform. Infinity bases are platform specific. Example: If you purchase Infinity for Wii and decide that you want to move to an XBox360, you will have to buy Infinity for XBox360 but you WILL NOT have to repurchase your characters.
Yes
The figurines are sold alone. The packs are sold with two characters and two power discs. The play sets are sold with two characters and their own "world" to play in.
Yes, all the infinity characters are designed to cohesively work together. It is kind of neat to see a Marvel character and Elsa cohabitate the game, she has similar powers to Iceman from the X-men
Yes, as I live in Australia. I have brought the item and it works here.
Its for 1.0 but can be used on the 2.0 in the toybox

Yes, it most definitely does have two player mode or single player.
The ESRB rating is E for everyon 10+, however this is a family friendly game. If you 6 year old watched the movie I don't see any problems with them playing this. As with all of the Lego games you have to smash objects and enemies, but it isn't a violent game. If you have any concerns download the free demo and play for a few. Great game if you are a fan of the film.
I don't think it will play through the Kinect. I read the game manual insert and the entire case and the Kinect wasn't mentioned. I have the 360 version, so if you have the Xbox 1 it may have added features, however I don't know. I played the entire game without seeing any mention of it. I hope this helped answer your question.
It comes with a case with the disc in it.
The game should auto-save as you are playing provided there is a hdd on the 360.
Yes there is you must complete the game first to unlock it.
Not really,........... my wife and I had to stop playing it, because is was too "busy"... The game itself is fairly self directed. In other words, not free-roaming.
Yes, you can earn all the characters from the movie. Similar to how you earn characters in other Lego games.
After you unlock them via secret code or via playing a story mode
Ahsen you unlock characters as you play an complete missions! Also money collected can unlock characters.

There is a very little noticeable difference, but the game is more interesting to play on the wii u. And also you hace the option to use the game pad as a standalone console.
Wii u games cannot be used on the wii but wii games can be played on the wii u
Yes very fun as well
I asked my son this, and he said he does not know. He has never seen the option for it. Sorry!
Yes
Lego Indiana jones 2
no,this game is only for the Wii U,all new games are now for Wii U
Yes and yes. It follows the formula of the other Lego video games, but I personally prefer this one among the rest. :P
No you can't
Yep

Yep
http://www.callofduty.com/ghosts/dlc/season-pass The season pass should follow you for free if you bought it before May 31, 2014, but I don't believe the game is available for a free upgrade anymore.
yes it's included with the other goodies...
I think it was worth it because the original price was $200 and I got it for half of that but the game itslef isn't that great
Yes but it is bad for the battery
This camera contain diferent bases for mount in helmet, or bike, or in the head, this camera it's great
yes it should be in with the game case
No it isn't sadly
Yes
Yes
Yes
Go for it man but make sure to check for the satisfaction percentage of the place that is selling it and where they are located
Anything. It also can be mounted on a bike or on the dash of a car.
Well the camera itself looks really badass and the quality is very good. It came with a 4gb micro sd but switched it for an 8. Also if you go airsofting you can attack the camera to your airsoft gun. I say its worth it, because a game cost $60 and thats how much your paying and the camera is basically free, which is very awesome. If it was original price I wouldn't get it but since its very low price its definitely worth buying.
Yes
Not it dosen't
Yes it is. The game alone cost about $50.this set also includes a tactical recorder. To capture all your online or off line play. It usually sells by itself for about $70-$100. So its a great bargain to get the game, expansion maps, recorder and a few more bonuses. Good buy. U recommend it.
No. Our Astro 2nd Gen batteries cannot be charged and discharged at the same time for protection of the battery.
The 6000 is capable of 2 full plus a half charges for my phone. It seems that 2500 is needed for for a full charge so figure that the 9000 is good for 3 charges and change. Choosing between the 6000 or the 9000 depends on how many times you need to charge for a given time away from an outlet. Also size and weight is something to consider.
Yes
It will start as soon as you plug it in.
If you are asking how long your PHONE or other item will stay charged, after charging....then I charged my phone in the AM at camp, and didn't use it much and it still had prob 40% or so when I went to bed. So a normal day's charge for me. The device itself, I've been home 2 weeks, and it still had 1/2 the usage bar full when my husband borrowed it this morning.
3.7 x 1.8 x 1 inches
I only used it to charge a HTC 1S. It showed up as USB charging.
My Galaxy S3 charge about 1 and a half times
Well to charge the Anker it comes w/ a wire to charge w computer but you can plug the USB side to you iphone plug. And to charge your iphone use your iphone wire
You can use the same charger you use for your phone or tab. You could also use the computer usb port but it takes much longer. If you want rapid charging you could also buy a rapid charger.
Not nearly as many bugs, but yes it still has issues (for example, graphics and audio loading issues when a multiplayer round is started). Still fun to play.
You will need a larger Hard Drive. The game is quite large and if you intend to play online, you will need more space for the online content, patches, and map packs. I would suggest that you upgrade your hard drive and move your data to the new drive and work from there.
Yes you can purchase premium through the game main menu it will say store click that and it will bring you to abunch of options you can buy including premium....
If you are referring to the harddrive on the Xbox or the an extra external drive you may purchased than yes. Thats how you save your game progress
No you have to purchase it from the store online............
Battlefield 4, although BF3 &gt; BF4 Destiny seems pretty good but it couldn't get me hooked like BF4 did.
No I don't think so. But there are switches that can stop vehicles from entering a certain area. You can also have a flashlight on your gun which can blond enemy's. This feature can be toggle on or off. Hope this help
You need a HDMI cable thst plugs from your 360 to your flat screen tv if It keeps on saying that then you need to just turn your xbox360 off and then back on or just restart the whole console if you need any other help please feel free to email me at allyboy94@yahoo.com
Thanks for the message.....this is the us version of the game.
Campaign is "single player" mode playing set missions against the computer. You can get online and play a campaign with other people on your team as well. Most people get online and play multi-player matches where everyone is a real person on both teams.
You do not need to buy an online pass to play a used copy of Battlefield 4 online. EA didn't put it in since it caused trouble with Battlefield 3.
I am not 100% positive, but I am pretty sure it will work on any PS3 console.
Mine is in English im not sure if you can change the language on it
As far as I know mulit language support for Battlefield 4 includes English, Spanish, French and Brazilian Portuguese... So yes it includes Spanish hope that helps you out.
I bought one copy and i worked on my ps3, Im in Colombia. Im sure it would work in Mxico.
When I first purchased my ps3 version, it had a $10 coupon for the ps4 version but there was no automatic upgrades and another purchase was required.
My son said no it doesn't; you have to buy it.
Yes it does but I'm not sure when it expires
no. it is in English. you could try to contact EA support (easupport.com) or go to battlelog.battlefield.com forums to find out information if a language package might be included in a future patch. gg
It is 5 inches from the microphone extension outlet. In reality, it is about 4 1/2 inches (or less) depending on how you bend or shape it. That is not really long enough and I have volume issues since purchasing these to the point where I'd just be better off with a secondary mic.
Yes, the right-side headphone can be removed.
Its standard 3.5mm connections. Shouldn't be a problem (no drivers)
it should come with an extra cord that lets you attach it to your iphone. its a string that has a input, and the chord to ur headset is inserted in this attachment. i recently used it to use it as a PS4 mic. so it is possible if you have that cord attachment
They are stitched on, so not sure that you can change them, but might be able to get covers over them.
Hi. No these do not work with the XBOX 306 just for Macs, PC's, tablets and phones. I hope this helps.
It works fine w/o internet. When it's connected to the internet, it simply gives you access to your profiles / settings that you have saved in their cloud. If you don't have access to the internet, it will just use the local copy of the settings you have. It's nice because if you go to someone else's house or use a different computer, you'll have your custom settings right there for you.
No - you can only change the intensity or turn it off all together, but you can't change the color.
I wouldn't say better...just different. I've used both now and the G13 has an awkward analog stick instead of the D-Pad. They're entirely two different devices as far as I'm concerned. Try them both and decide for yourself.
I haven't had any issues
Yes I am currently running it on Windows 8.1
The fit is almost exactly the same. The palm rest comes a little further out for large hands that. They removed the wheel and gave you a button, which matches up with most games giving you 12 action buttons and then you still have room for Shift/Ctrl/Alt on the pinky side. The buttons feel the same as the TE, they aren't mechanical like the Orbweaver, but they are responsive. Yes there still is a thumb button above the "hat" joystick and a thumb paddle button below it (hard to see in pictures). It seems that Razer also improved the software somewhat over the N52TE with one exception - we lost the "repeat until another button it pressed" macro action. So you have to toggle on/off macros now. Maybe they will fix that in a future release.
I'm 6'4" (1.93 m) with fairly large hands and it fits great.
Yes James it should do you good there
Yes and absolutely yes. this keypad barely has enough buttons for the whole alphabet, let alone an entire keyboard. By no means trash a keyboard for this, it's purely meant for a more ergonomic input method. As for the wired/wireless, there are tradeoffs. Personally wired is more reliable, no battery to worry about and no wonky connection issues to deal with. But if you can't configure it to be somewhere comfortable for you within the reach of the wire, that's what wireless is for. Be advised that any wireless device will have at least a tiny bit of lagged input to the computer, so it's not advised for anything competitive.
I'm not sure if it is good for the game in question but I love this thing. Never crashed one time on me.
This headset can connect to an Xbox One controller through the (optional purchase) Stereo Headset Adapter from Microsoft.
about 4 feet.
You need the TV volume. This is a chat headset.
Yes you can still hear sound (from your home surround sound system), they are vented so that they are not sealing out the outside sound. These are just for voice, work well
It plugs into controller .
I dont know for sure, but I doubt it. Also, the one I bought is unusable because the sound is so low I cant even hear what anyone is saying if the is any noise at all in the room, like a fan, an open window, the game sounds or music. My advice is go to Game Stop and get a full headset meant for PS3.
Yes. The mic is reversible and will go either direction.
I personally don't own a PS3, but my friend uses it for hers.
You need to enable it within settings under devices I believe. Look through PS4 settings menu. You may need to reboot PS4 afterwards too. Set it to output to headset.
You are able to get dolby digital audio through the spidif, if you use the bluetooth as comunication device on your computer you will be able to use speaker and microphone on your headsets as mean of comunication. The spidif it self does not support the microphone audio to be send. I have been using the blutooth for skype calls and online gaming and it works. Hope this helps.
I would check the PS4 settings for chat volume. The headset has chat control on the right side of the headphone. Hope that helps
Pull on the middle of the cord, not on the base attached to the headset.
It's the Turtle Beach PX4. If it's wireless that will confirm it. Also if you have the accessories of the PX4
Yes the headset is compatible with PS3 as well as ps4...awesome headset. I purchased the headset when the ps4 first came out on day 1 and a year and half later it's still running like a champ.
NO
I would assume so. It has an audiojack cord, and I've used it in a pinch for my ipod and pc. I don't own a vita, so I don't know what size jack it has.
Yes. It has a feature to automatically adjust chat volume according to the sound signal, ie what's going on in the game. So if youre in a loud cinematic in game moment, the chat will also j crease in volume. I turn the sound down most of the time unless I'm gaming alone. I personally I don't like the feature because it sounds like people are uelling in your ear when the music gets loud
Yes you can. You will need to sync the headphones to the laptop. It will work as long as your laptop has blue tooth capabilities. You can find out by going to the master volume control on the laptop's control panel. Hope this helps.

Yes, it will come with everything you need to open the box, set it up and start playing. If anything is missing or if something is not working, let us know right away and we'll help you out. You get the same one year limited warranty and the same 30 day return period as all other ASTRO products.
Yes, it comes with everything and is packaged like it was new.
Yes
So, I deleted my earlier post. Getting 2 audio sources to play simultaneously is actually pretty easy. The mixamp has a line in for spdif (optical) and your typical aux 3.5mm jack. I hooked my computer via spdif and my TV via aux. You'll get both AND be able to toggle the balance with the right earcup game/VoIP switch. (I initially thought it didn't work, as I was 100% to my computer source, hence my deleted answer. Don't make my mistake). I would recommend the spdif from your console and aux from your computer, you'll get better in game sound. The balance feature is really nice, and it is tailored to your exact needs.
Yes they are.
Yes
No, the chat cable runs directly into the headset from the controller.
Yes all ASTRO products will work with the next generation PS4. It uses the same technology that the PS3 used so there are no additional products you need. Sony will be releasing a firmware update though after release that will be required for the chat to work. No details have yet been released about this update. Regards, ASTRO Gaming
No there is no other accessories you need. When you get your new Astro's just plug them into your PC and download the lastest firmware for them and you are good to go. The PS4 does accept this device and never had a issue.
I had problems with my mic on Windows 7. Works fine on Windows 8. There could be a ton of reasons though. You need it set as default in your sound setting and typically selected in the program you are using too. Also, if the mic boom is straight up, it turns the mic off.
A key for each.
All dlc for origins, base game only for da2. Note that to properly authorize dlc for origins, latest patch must be downloaded.
The key is for origin
Yup... Works on Windows 8.

The stealth edition does not have the distinct "click" with every keystroke. It will sound more like your traditional keyboard when you press the key.
yes.
This does have mechanical switches. In past years, Razer used Cherry switches. However, in this and other current models, Razer is using their own mechanical switches. Unclear if they outsourced the design and manufacture of these new switches.
They are just Green . Chroma version has unlimited colors!
Just the ultimate.
The only difference between the backlit and the standard is well backlit! And the difference between the stelth and the greens are the stealth isint clicky
The new razer keyboards have razer switches so the standard has the razer greens and the stealth uses the razer orange
Yes, on the right hand side of keyboard there are a USB port, a headphone jack and a microphone jack.
The side USB and headphone/microphone jacks are ever so helpful(to me), and the key-caps are the slightest bit different ...Aside from that (and the back lighting), they are the exact same keyboard.
I don't know if these are the latest versions, but these only have one color, which is green. If you want the ones that do change color, you're probably looking for the Chroma Blackwidows.
Yes Yes Yes and YES!!
No, you cannot. You can play split screen with others on Xbox Live, but not with the person sitting next to you on your own couch. How annoying is that?!
For 360, you have to sign in under the person that has the gold membership, go to settings, accounts, memberships, and make sure your gold membership is applied. Whoever plays will have to play on that persons login. From what I have read online, for the xbox 360, each person has to have their own gold membership in order to play under their own login...which doesn't make sense because you have to be 13 to get a gold membership, yet the game is rated for 10+ and you can't play without gold.
No
You need an Xbox live gold subscription.... Xbox live gold is a paid subscription that Xbox users have to buy in order to play online games. Without a gold subscription you can only buy services and games from Microsoft but you cannot play online, since this game only has online multiplayer and no single player campaign you can't use it without the paid subscription.
The developers don't tell the players
It is xbox live players only
I think acess too certain games in xbox one requires the same gold membership extra money per player as 360. play station does not require additional payment no matter what version and all games like Minecraft and plants vs zombies are ps just like xbox. only xbox seems to want to charge extra
They are on different servers
it is a monthly membership. if you don't have it - you cannot play the game... AT ALL! would have been nice to know that before we bought it.
Yes Yes Yes and YES!!

It's actually quite fun regardless of age. I would even bet most of the players are older! I wouldn't judge it based in its wonky and cartoonish presentation. It's rather very competitive, deep, and balanced, and a lot of fun actually. I found me and my friends got hooked on it for months. IMO it's the best xbox one game to date. Looks great, plays great and it fun what more could you want It's has a third person view, also a zombie or plant master mode where you kind of micromanage as well. Has character cards to unlock abilities and customization for classes. A survival wave mode, team death match, and a domination style mode. All of them are very fun. Every class requires a certain strategy to succeed. I recommend the game to anyone honestly. It's out for Microsoft consoles but will be out on pc and ps3 and ps4 soon I believe
Each family members need to have Xbox Gold in order to play online. Since you have it, only you can play XBL. Also make sure the Xbox Gold time in your account is not expired.
Correct. It's a online only play game.
No
I'm not sure if it's technically possible (no way to test it since I'm linked up), but even if you can, you won't be able to play it well, and it's not a significant enough part of the game to justify a purchase. The co-op part of the game is balanced around planting "assistant" plants that are only available through card packs that you acquire online (either by earning coins in-game or buying them for cash) through the EA servers. No connection, no packs, no helpers, no way to win.
Yes you do need 2 Xbox live account's to do split screen
Nope- and currently your stats do not transfer
With the physical disk you can re-sale/trade-in. With the digital download you can't.
Sadly, it's only 2 player local only splitscreen. And you can only use one profile at a time, so the 2 player is limited to player 1's progress. Kinda lame.

Absolutely give it another try! I also had to return my original for a defect, but my replacement is doing fine. I just can't race Forza 5 without it. Racing with a controller makes no sense.
Same style of attachment except better if that helps. I've had both.
There good now you'll still need to updated on a PC to the latest firmware.
Yes
you'll most likely have to get it directly from Thrustmaster since the connector setup looks like it is specific to their product.
The people having problems didnt take the time to update to the newest and correct firmware. Even the one I ordered had issues when I first tried it. After the update and applying the correct in game settings, everything worked perfectly and continues to this day. I hope this helps.
I have not had any issues with my wheel. I use it a lot on my Xbox and some on my pc. A few friends have had theirs since not long after release without issues. I was a bit hesitant also when I bought it but I'm glad I ordered one. Has made Forza horizons so much fun.
120v the power block is now internal so all you have is about a 5 foot power cord.
I don't know if amazon will let me spell it but here it is http://www.thrustmaster.com/en_US then go to downloads and choose your system thrustmaster dot com just in case you don't see the link
Hello Angie. No, this wheel don't have any input for Microfone. You will need connect your headset to your controller.
Not universal but can be used in 110 true 220v in my country(turkey) we use 220v and i do not have any problem about that. Great product, you should buy it.
Yes it works in the US, and yes, it will charge your controllers until they are full, then it stops. I own this item, it works great!
it charges both at the same time:) and it will stop charging one once it's full.
No, the charger has an automatic shutoff so it won't keep charging. It's designed to hold the controllers until you are ready to use.
Standard legnth, 6ft.
No, you just push down on the controller once set in the cradle and it "clicks" into place and starts charging. It's instant.
I haven't used any other chargers, so it is hard to compare, but this is my personal observations so far (2 months of use): I have not noticed any decrease in charge capacity after use. Typically mine will charge from 1/3 to full capacity of controler in 1.5 to 2 hours, this doesn't seem to be too fast.
Light is either blue or off on the controller. I know when I first plug it in its an orangish color.
Found it on amazon and ebay for about $90... but i got a stand at game stop for $19.00 not official but it's just a piece of plastic
No. You cannot use it to charge the headset.
Would not recommend as an internet machine. Has basic functionality but not the greatest. Better as a game platform.
You can use old games - regular DS, 2DS and 3DS games work on it.
yes but not if you order one from Japan they are regional blocked
yes
North America.
ASIN B00EOAMRH6 is the pink color. The other colors have different ASINs.
Yes
Unfortunately, the system that I received can only select English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese as languages.
Nintendo, like many other purveyors of electronic media, enforce a region lock on many of their systems and games. Unfortunately, the 3ds line is region locked and the United States and Europe are in two different regions.
You'll have to link to the other device for specification. This is an XL model, which makes the screen bigger.
Yes my son uses it on his laptop. Windows 8.1 lenova laptop
I don't understand. Of course it will work for God of War, it's just a standard PS3 controller. The buttons are incredibly responsive. The d-pad especially is wonderful, although I'd expect you won't use that if GOW. The face buttons have nice rounded edges which is great for standard beat-em-up fare like rapid square/triangle combos. I have a callus on my thumb from playing Castle Crashers on a stock PS3 controller. The HORI works much better for me.
Mostly yes, that's more game-specific, you'll probly want an external remapping app such as joy2key or Xpadder for some games.
Yes it comes with the cord. The cord is attached to it .
Yes
Not sure about that unless you mean the two thumb controllers that rotate sorta like a gyroscope. It also has a turbo feature.
It only works with the PS3, so no it does not work on a MAC.
Yes
Hello Eric, You sure can use 2 Stinkyboards at the same time. You can actually use as many Stinkies as you have USB ports. Each board can be given a unique name and programmed separately.
Yes, you can use it on several computers. The configuration is stored in the peripheral. Steph
Yes...it has a "pulse" setting that can be used to repeatedly press a key rapidly and also has a adjusting rate to set how many times per second it will press.
No, it only accepts on key press at a time at a time. There are some games or software where it's quite handy (at replacing those awkward key reaches for crouching, ducking, throwing a grenade, or swapping weapons) there are other games (WASD) where it's not as useful for steerage. It can do dual-key commands, but sadly it does not do macros. It's a niche product and takes a little bit of a learning curve to train yourself to use it. It's a very sturdy product that uses Cherry keys and will likely outlive me, but I do not use it in all situations.
I think it is possible. One switch to increase and one to decrease volume. However, figuring out which keys to bind may be tricky.
Yes, it does. It uses MX Cherry switches, so internally it works just like a keyboard.
Yes
No - it's very clicky in each of the four directions, and slightly sticky. I've found that even just using it as arrow keys is difficult, w.r.t. getting precise motion.
Sure. The driver is always loaded. You can bind the four switches to anything you like.
Just like a keyboard. Thing is great
I'm not sure what triton triggers are, but I have a pair of high end triton headphones that I use with my Xbox 360. I purchased this cable to replace the oem one that broke! Hope this helps some!
Yes, that is why I bought it, and it works good. Yes
Yes
nope, only a mute button and a chat volume button
Yes.
Brother this won't work with ANY headset....save your money. Five bucks wasted is not a savings.
Mine did not operate/function Waste of money. Don't do it.
it may its a 3.5 attachment
Yes it works great and for that Price you can't beat it.
I honestly don't know. I bought it for my turtle beaches. But i've yet to find anything that it actually fits. Won't work on tritons, razers, or turtle beaches. I wouldn't recommend you buy it.
I am not an expert or anything but i have a US PS3 and it worked fine. Though I would take Note before buying this that you have a HDTV and HDMI Cord because this game can only be played in 1080p.
If you download the US version, you'll be able to use the DLC. The hard copy is from Europe and they do not have DLC. I hope that answers your question.
Most of the higher priced one piece games are the English games and Japanese ones sell for less
English, only the audio is in japanese

Yeah the five episodes and the dlc are on the disc, the game is in english
It's on the physical disc, not a code or DLC you have to grab from the store.
It depends on what format you are playing it on. For me, I was playing it on Playstation 3. I know that it gives you episode 1 for free on the IOS app as well as Android, and then after that you have to pay either $5 per additional episode or you can buy the season pass, which I believe is $19.99 which also includes the 400 Days bonus episode. Either way, you have to purchase the remaining episodes, no matter what platform you are on, unless you buy that disc version of the game. Hope this helps.
Right it is a move and click game which might not be for everyone. I enjoyed it and the game has a great story, which you are the creator of episode to episode.
Yes. It's a survial game. You will be shooting and fighting zombies also there's diolouge and choices you have to make quickly.
need set up with psn account otherwise waste money
Yes, it is possible. I'm so sorry I missed read the email I was sent regarding Marie's question!
Nope. It's a good thing too, because that way you will only be subjecting a freshman in high school to some harmless violence (e.g., smashing a man's brain in with a pallet) instead of something truly horrific like sex.
To finish the game is not so long. But to see all the possible routes, you need very very long play.
Third person except for a couple of shooting sequences in episodes 3, 4, and 5.
Yes because like me you bought the UK version right or Asian. End you are trying to play it in the states. Which is a different format and the download content only works on the US version so they match up I bought all the downloads and can't use them either
Yes, it has nothing to do with tv itself, it is more related to the console region, but this one is region free so will work on any ps3.
Yes it should my game still works fine
Yes it does , its an amazing game , you could also do a set of multiple characters and arrange them into fights to get to the top
Yes I live in arizona
No amigo solo en ingles tal ves alla otra version en espaol .. sorry bro its in english maybe there is another version
The options are in english caracters speak japanise but they are subtitles so no problem awesome game for usa fans just make sure the video is from uk region free or english subtitle on thr specs
Is like a story mode with standar fighting check it out on you tube the game play if you like it
Yes it does!
Yea that is the cover and it does not have spanish subtitles, only English and French
no it doesn't come with all the DLC you still have to buy some and the skins have to be purchased seperatly as well.
Yes. This game works on Windows 8 & 8.1
The game provides a Steam Code. There is no DVD required to play the game.
I'll double-check with our shipper, but I'm 99.9% sure it's USPS. If you don't hear contrary info from us early tomorrow, doubtful, then it's USPS. Thanks!
well its most dlcs beside 3 hunter packs and1 dlc with +10lvls, and no ekstra skins at all :) all of this must be bought separately
I can find no option in my version that allows for languages other than English.
test it on this website : http://www.systemrequirementslab.com
Yes you can.
Yes. BL2 is a Steamworks game.

No, There are no headhunter packs. This is still an awesome deal because of the 4 DLC already included, each a game in itself. There are 5 headhunter packs total. Xbox live had the headhunter packs for 50% off yesterday. Might still be going on...
You don't need an internet connection to play it, and it's kinda open ended, it's linear in a Skyrim sense, but parts of the world can only be unlocked through story quests.
this game does not say that it is in spanish we only have it in english. thank you and have a great day.
Brand new CD so you can get rid of your other one. :D
It comes with all the DLC. My copy did not come with any pre-order bonuses, if that is what you mean.
Its on the disc it just installs it to your harddrive just make sure you have enough room on it.
If you need a map to play, go on the Internet. This is one of the best fps rpgs out there. You want it
This just comes with dlc. You can still play as the gunzercer, siren, assasin, and soldier, but it adds the mechromancer and psycho. You meet the characters from the original game in the story.
Yes, you can add on the extra downloadable content to multiple devices. I have done this to three different consoles, without issue.
No. This game comes with all the latest updates, patches and DLCs. The DLC's for the game though you will need a hard drive for since they take up 4.5 space of storage.
In Ireland and it works fine.
Hi Coleman. If you search up "Football Manager 2014"on the Amazon search bar, once you are on the page you should look at the right side of your screen and it should say "Go to your Games library". Above that you should see "How to redeem this item" just click on it and it should give you the instructions. Just incase that doesn't work, here is the link for the instructions
If you are running Windows virtually and that VM meets minimum specs I don't see why it wouldn't run. Keep it mind if the VM doesn't connect to internet at all, you will want to get the disc version.
If you have the disc no However if you have the code yes Luckily you can play off line after you download it, and downloading steam is very simple and fast
good

Yes it comes with two codes you enter at the nintendo eshop. One is for a downloadable digital copy of Windwaker and the other is for a digital copy of the Hyrule Historia the history of the legend of zelda game series. And I must say that Windwaker looks amazing and the few little things they added/improved like the speed sail so you move faster through the water is great!
No, only Wind Waker.
32GB, just like the deluxe version. About 3GB is used by the system, but you still get about 29GB
No, Wii U system and Gamepad only.
It's the standard battery, but it lasts a good amount of time. Unless you're going to be playing all day without a break, it should be plenty. Also, are the extended replacement batteries even out yet? I was under the impression those haven't been released yet (as of this writing).
I don't know you tell me.
When I received it, it had not been opened. It is like if you would buy it from a place like Walmart. Everything is there.
I'm not entirely sure but since they're still selling it and sometimes products take awhile to move I would imagine there isn't an expiration date. At the very least it would probably be good until their next console comes out. However, like I said I'm not that sure on this since I just did mine a couple of days after I got it. If you're thinking along the lines of holiday presents then I would say you would definitely be good there.
Yes, it has both ports, hdmi and component
No
No it does not.
America.
Unfortunately, No Its Just The System
Depends on how you break it. If it breaks from faulty parts or something similar, it's under warranty by Nintendo. If you take it outside and jump on it and then smash it with a hammer, then no I don't think so. :)
This gaming system can play DS games as well as 3DS games. All DS games should work in this system.
ours was brand new in the box. yes it has a 1 year warranty
I dont think so
Gaming keyboards have faster reaction times
I believe the red one is the older version and do not have the backlight.
The kb delivered to me is different. Amazon.com made a wrong delivery.
It's pretty quiet. The quietest keyboard I have ever owned. Had mine for almost 6 months and I use it very heavily. Outstanding product for the price
No, but it look pretty awesome and fairly easy to setup.
Not sure if it will work for mac... Connector is USB port :)
Yes. Just let it install the driver automatically.
Assassins Creed Ezio Trilogy comes with three separate games: Assassins Creed II, Assassins Creed Brotherhood and Assassins Creed Revelations. All three have the option of Several spoken languages, including Spanish. However, Assassins Creed II only has subtitles in English. The others have many choices for subtitles, including Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Norwegian, etc.
You can play directly from the disk. There are three discs, one for each game
Yes definitely
No
Yes
The discs are in separate disc trays
Yes. They are all in one case on separate disks. The case looks just like the picture
Yes, it has online multiplayer 4-8 players. It has an offline campaign of 1 player.
They are 3 separate discs.
If you mean all three games in one place as in three games on one disc, then no. But it is all three games in one place in that they took the three discs, discarded the original boxes, and put them all in one box. Since the games are unchanged aside from a missing case, the achievements do all still activate.
500 GB
Yes, it is excellent
only on 110
No it doesn't!
yes, it has autovolt transformer. REgards
Yes if they or you have wifi or Internet connection.
No it doesnt, and also if you make the math, theres no savings in the bundles, they charge you exactly the same as if you buy the additional items separately.
You have to have an extra usb cord, cause it only comes with one. But if you have two chords there are 2 ports on the console, so you can charge both at the same time.
Not sure where these other people were looking but it will play blu-ray...per the playstation.com website: "Yes, you will need to download and install PS4's day-one system software update 1.50, and then activate your Blu-ray Disc video capability with a one-time activation through the internet in order to play Blu-ray Disc films and DVD video content."
No
Yes, i just tried and it worked
No it does not, it comes it a plastic clear box.
Hello Matt, the Ouroboros performs quite well on non-traditional surfaces surprisingly. I have tried it on wood (desk), vinyl (like a fold out table surface), plastic (video game case), my razer mouse pad, and on my bed all seem to have little effect. I will say this though that it seems most important that the surface is smooth/flat. Let me know if you would like to know anything else!
It does not use bluetooth. It has a dongle that is built into the charging stand, which has a micro usb port. A usb cable with a micro usb male tip and regular usb female tip is included. The usb cable pulgs into the charging tower and the pc: this setup is for wireless mouse use. For wired use, the usb cable plugs directly to the mouse and the pc: this setup unpowers the charging stand, but the mouse is being charged by the cable. Not sure what frequency the wireless connection is, but the response time is nearly identical to the wired setup. I dont play FPS games, so I may not be aware of any differences that other programs or games would allow me to notice. As for other games, drawing and painting, designing etc, I cannot physically tell the difference between wired and wireless modes.
The side buttons are well designed and will not be accidentally pressed easily, no matter what type of wings you choose. And the feel is clicky.
Nope, changing from the "wing" to the "flat" side panel has no effect on the button, the panel lays over the button, also it's default configuration is for DPI throttling. Hope this helps!
It depends. I know the Razer Ouroboros is a great product because I use it every single day. I have not used the Logitech mouse so I can't really compare the two. They Razer mouse is more adaptable if you are left handed than most computer mice. It has a very different button layout than the Logitech though. So, it depends on how often you use the additional buttons (other than the left and right click and the mouse wheel, which are now pretty standard inclusions). If you use them often you will want to consider which ones you will be more comfortable using. I do like the stabilizing wings on the Razer mouse, which the Logitech does not appear to have. I don't know that I have helped much, but they are two very different mice and I don't know nearly enough about the Logitech to give you a better answer.
Yes. Since it is USB 2.0/3.0 compatible it is capable of being used on any OS that has USB driver support (generally UPnP)
There is through a custom tool developed outside of Razer: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/razer#Compatibility
You dont need a plug for it, it only needs an USB port
yes!
I think u can
Yes, but only in a mode called Garden Ops ( you protect your garden from AI zombies) and you still need to be online. ( select private match/ invite only )
It took several hours (maybe 3-4?). But I have cable modem, so it would be faster than your DSL. That was my frustration with this purchase... downloading that much to my son's PC, and then NOT have it work unless it was on-line! Amazon never offered me a refund nor was there a way to request one.
I believe so. The only real issue with Vista is that it doesn't have anti-virus updates any longer. I liked it much better than the Windows 8 I have now. My son loves this game, so I'm sure yours will too.
I would say most games are better on an Xbox but the pc version of this game works really well. The graphics are great, colors are vivid and there's no lag time in play. I bought this version so our son could play it and not tie up our big screen TV. It was a great compromise for us.
Hi. I dont know. I buy this game and run it in my Hp laptop with 12Ghz
I did not try it on mac. I am using windows 7. But i think it should work on any PCs. As long as the origin server works on you pc, you should be able to play this games on that server.
Yes as long as your credit card matches the US Address.If not,Then no
No
yes!

yes absolutely in fact that's exactly why i bought it. you just plug it in and play;^) i use it to play skyrim at work when its slow lol. i have a Macbook Pro loaded up with Windows 7 via Bootcamp.
I bought it for my Grandson. It is approx 6 feet long. He dances around & jumps up & down in front of the Big-Screen. Plenty of room for that.
It simply means that Microsoft did not manufacture the controller at one of their plants or a company That is officially licensed to manufacturer their products.
No, but there are instructions on the box that will teach you how to wire/wrap your own cord. Just kidding, of course it comes with a cord.
Yes Nathen it does I HAVE THIS controler for 3 weeks now and its still the best one ever
Yes
10 feet.
Yes it will work for any windows platform.
As far as I know, you can only turn off the lights.
No, but it comes in a very professional box beside the control is awesome when u turn the light off, vibration is great, a really good investment I will buy a blue one as I got a green one ;)
Must be 3 or 4 feet. Hasn't been an issue for me because I sit next to my tower but its long enough to comfortably wrap around and plug it in the back and still have slack
Yes it does
Seems to be just over 7 feet.
Yes
I assme it should work for Mac computers. I'm sure the controller's drivers will automatically install once you plug it into the USB port on your Mac.
Hello, Not from this company. PDP has a yellow controller that lights up. Copy and paste these key words in the Amazon search bar: Rock Candy Xbox 360 Controller - Yellow. Hope this helps! Media Branch
The only thing that I could find was this: Gu5.3 LED Bulbs, Light Lamp, 50w 60w Equivalent. The wattage seems a little high but the LEDs inside these contrallers are crazy bright. I never have mine on but my kids think that its cool.
I'm assuming its because not many people purchase this color, so the price is going low so people start buying it. It's not like it's cheaper because its not functional or anything of the sort
It is. I've been playing Dark Souls 2 with this controller on 8.1
My son says his still works and works well.
This Controller works on windows Vista, and windows 8, and is exextremely finicky with windows 7. It's really only made for xb360 though.
It's super cheap and will break quickly. I would not buy it.
This is a wired controller. It is permanently attached to the controller on one end and has a standard USB connector on the other end.
Theres a button on the back of the controller try pressing that. It should fix it if not then idk what it could be
The AX1 is older.
Yes it still will light up and vibrate.
I do not know if i can answer the question, but check the game settings.
Yes, as long as you either have a spot to insert an SD card or you own an SD card reader you should be able to.
not very loud
The Nintendo 3DS system has two separate screens. The top screen is a 3.53 in (90 mm) 15:9 (5:3) autostereoscopic (3D) LCD screen with a resolution of 800240 pixels (400240 pixels per eye, WQVGA) that is able to produce a three-dimensional effect without 3D glasses using a parallax barrier. According to a spec sheet from Nintendo, the screens on Nintendo 2DS are the same size as the current 3DS model. The upper screen measures 3.53 inches and the lower screen measures 3.02 inches. Those dimensions are smaller than the 3DS XL, which has screens 4.88 inches and 4.18 inches in size. Hoped this helped.
Yes
Yes
To do online functions, yes, otherwise you can play w/o wifi
There is a "share" function between all DS' but it requires the DS without the game to download it from the other and for the desired game to allow "Download play". You should also probably note that the shared version of the game isn't actually the full game and only allows limited content for the downloader; although the game is downloaded it is also required that the two DS' stay within a close enough range to hold the wireless signal. If it's a single player game you'll most likely have to buy 2 but if it's a game like Mario kart or multiplayer centered you could probably do fine just buying one and require the kids to be civil about who gets the full content or share.
Of course silly. But only a wall block and usb cable. No car charger. Amazon has a great $20 kit that comes with a car charger and nice carrying case.
I have 2 children that have 2DS 12year and 10years old. They take them every were. The game cards and the styles are hard to keep track of. But they seem to keep going.
To my knowledge the 2ds can only link to another 2ds or a 3ds since they are basically the same device.
Yes, as long as you either have a spot to insert an SD card or you own an SD card reader you should be able to.

hi it includes Manual, charger and stick!
nope
No
Yes.
Not sure whether you fixed the problem or not. Sorry for the late answer. It might be a bad ac adapter you have or the battery is dead.
No its closer to the size of the standard 3ds.
Yes to 3DS games and most of the regular games - as i was told by a Gamestop clerk.
its supply and demand. The blue one is more popular then the red so some try to sell the blue for more. Most stores sell them both for the same price.
I cannot say definitively. This is Amazon, and they do have their customer guarantee policies for damaged/defective products. However, I purchased mine as a used product, so I cannot say a brand new version would not have a copy of Nintendo's warranty provided with it. That being said however, I do believe that some form of a product warranty would be available to you since you are buying this product from an Official buyers/traders marketplace.
no it comes by itself with a charger
Yes, I imported the vita to the uk and had no problem with changing the language. The only problem I have encountered is with some games the x and o buttons swap functionality.
The charger, the vita itself, and paperwork.
Some qr cards you probably won't use. The system itself a charger (that was surprisingly long) and some manuals in Japanese. There's not much to it other than that.
Japanese imported Vitas do have O for confirm and X for back. You can't change that. But it's only for the main menu! If you're buying Western games, it isn't like that. I've gotten kind of used to it since the games still have O for back and X for confirm.
Yes, sony products are not region locked. So it can play any american game / Japanese games!
Only difference is color and O is select and X is back if color matters to you get the import of not get the borderlands 2 bundle with black vita slim I think it's only 199 hope that helps
Definitely not true. I've had mine for.... Well, I while, at least six months or so and it's still kicking haha. My friend has an American version and he prefers mine due to the color. Cuz that's really the only difference! Sounds like your friend just hates happiness and color, cuz that's what you get with the Japanese vita xD
It is used condition and no official warranty but I guarantee for 3 month.Thanks
You choose the language in the initial set up. Really the only difference is color and you use circle to confirm x to go back in the OS menus (in games its normal).
Games usually stay the same. The only difference is in the Vita menus.
I think yes! http://www.siliconera.com/2013/09/10/playstation-vita-tv-will-play-persona-4-golden-lumines-and-these-other-games/ check here
Hold off until US release hope it will be at E3
PS Vita TV is a stand alone high definition console version that connects to your television. It will not stream from a PS Vita handheld system! The Japanese PS Vita TV system is very limited in the US with most games and app service not able to operate. YouTube will not work work on a PS Vita tv , but works on a Vita handheld system! Crazy!!! You have to have a Japanese Playstation account to use it!! No option to connect a US account! An US version is going to be released in October 2014 and hopefully open all the locked out apps and games. It will stream video and games from a Playstion 4 console, but seem to lose connection quite a bit for me. Hopefully after the US release all these problems will be worked out. The system has great potential, but Sony seems to be holding it back and letting it die like the Vita handheld.
Psp games look really bad, not meant for big screen. Images are stretched and very pixelated.
Yes
You don't stream the compatible versions. You just download an play. Everything else you stream.
Not for me.
Yes you can however there is an compatibility list. Not every game on ps vita will function correctly right now.
No it has to be plugged into the ps4 for it to work.
When you press the Left Analog Stick (L3) you'll see a hand with a finger pointing out, moving the analog while holding the O button simulates the front touch screen. The Right Analog Stick (R3) is for the back screen and when you press the other stick while in Touch Screen mode, you'll be touch both screens. TL;DR: Press L3 for Touch screen, O button actually touches the screen
My American games work just fine on it. Pretty sure games from any region will work on it though.
It comes with the vita console, charger and instructions all in the official playstation vita console boxing
Can you state your question in more detail. The vita is packaged with an original Japanese box therefore the package does contain Japanese words describing the vita. The only English words on the box are PSVITA, SONY, Lime and Green/White.
Yes
Yes
Mine did not, what I can gather from the Japanese on the back of the box, I don't think it's suppose to.
Yes u can play all english games, and save all your game saves on the 1gb storage without a memory card. If u decide to buy a memory card later on all saves will transfer over to new memory card.
Yes. everything works just like the american version. Only diff is in home screen is O button is to confirm and X is to cancel but its no biggie
Yeah I've had mine for a while too, and haven't encountered any problems with the wireless, however sometimes the joystick becomes unresponsive and moves my character spuratically.
Yes
It's for playing vita games on your television. . But it is region locked and you must open a Japanese PSN account. I like mine would just love it if it was region locked
It is a screen-less PSVita. Think of it that way. It is a cross between a PS Vita and an AppleTV or similar. On the one hand, it is quite small and streams everything. On the other hand, the lack of a touch screen (and back screen) limits the number of Vita games it can play. However, it could stream your PS4 to another room (It will use a PS4 controller with the latest firmware). You will have to have a JPN PSN account to ropily set it up.
It's not on the list. And only few us titles can be played on vita Tv..........
Don't buy this yet it's region locked to Japanese psn aaccounts. Wait about 4 more months
Yes
Yes you still need a jp email address also.
Nothing except the color and name. They are both the exact same thing.
Yes as of patch 3.30 u can but come oct 15th will be released in us. Psn store is not fully updated yet but will be soon.
You can't create NA account because it's region-locked. It'll allow you to update to new firmware like any other console.
I think it's only available in Japan
Yessir David, works perfectly just like a chip from here. I got mine in the mail not too long ago and couldn't be happier with all the space it has on it
It worked if you are still curious lol
Thank you asking. Normal shippng:(sal/small post) is about 10~14days to US .
Yes. It's sealed original packaging. If you dislike this product after purchasing from us, you can return this product to Amazom.com. Best regards,
You could sell it.
Format or not it only lets you use 60gb
Seems to be about the same as the 4GB card, but that is just based upon loading times when I used both. Haven't attempted to test with my PC for fear of possible accidental damage to the card.
Once you hook your vita up to the PC it should prompt you to install the content manager program. Using that program you can copy the data from the memory card to your PC. Then insert the new memory card into the vita and copy the data onto the new memory card.
More than any other memory card, depends on game size or movie size, some games are 500mb up to 6+gigs same with movies. It just gives you the maximum amount of room to budget on one memory stick.
It should work. I have an original OLED Vita I got from the U.S. I popped the memory card in and it worked.
Online gaming and the PlayStation store both work normally and you will have no problems. The only difference between a US Vita and Japan version that I can tell is that the circle button okay's things and the X button backs up out of menus.
Yes, the included ac adapter works in the USA.
Hello. I can ship this item to Cambodia.
Yes you can
Yeah
My is a Japanese import but I'm not planning to sell my if you like go check out seller japan premium that where I bought my
It supports quite a few languages. You select the language during setup.
No you cannot. Playstation and Xbox are on two completely different networks. However, if your friend another Vita, you can play there.
No
it's a retail box version, in other words, it come with original packaging with factory seal (of course, box written in Japanese)
Yes. I got this for my kids for Christmas and it is pretty much the same thing as a regular wii but can not connect to wifi. It is also just different color. Plays all the wii games but not wii u games. Hope this helps.
Sure you can. It actually depends on the game you want to play that allows 2 players. This particular item comes with only one controller, so you will have to buy the wiimote and nunchuck (if needed). That was my case.
It is not capable of any form of HD as it only ouputs 480i via a RCA cable.
You can do 4 people simultaneously (even more if you buy extra equipment). When you purchase a game just look at the back of the cover and see how many players it is made for.
Yes, they work.
the only difference between this wii and other one is it will not hook up to internet can not watch movies or play games with others on internet...all other functions are same...so yes it will
Every Wii game we tried with it works great (old and new).
None
Yes it does.
Yes
Hi. Yes English or in German. You can choose when you install the game. So to answer your question is has both.
Yes
The DVD is needed to install the game. It is not needed to play the game.
The code comes with the game if it's new. If it is used you can get it from steam.
You could claw if you want to. The ergonomics are good for palming though.
Try delete the driver and reinstall again?
Yeah, any USB mouse will work on a macbook!
Yes
to be honest thats not something i have tried to do. sorry i couldnt be more help. but i really like the mouse, if remapping is a deal breaker maybe look at something else just to be safe, but if its not this mouse is very cool
Nope! Everything is on the disk. One of the great things about GotY games is they come packed with everything ready to go.
No you can play the first disc...or install the dlc from the 2nd...once you install it...it goes to your hard drive...both are not needed...hope this helps.
First time through... roughly 18 - 20 hours long.
I think because of the violence , blood , some gore, there is also a brothel, and just the subject matter over all else. But Those are the only reasons that I can think of. And why they gave it an M rating.
Yes
Yes
Yes
I don't believe so since it never ask me for one. It just uses the internal that is there. the only reason I can think of why it would require an additional hard drive is if your drive is full. you might want to check that and delete any old saves you don't need any longer.
Mine did.
Yes
it comes with a usb dongle (hidden between the joy sticks). just plug it in and it'll self install the drivers (windows 7 tested). after that it's up to you to bind the buttons to your games. the usb cable does nothing but charge it
A little over 8 ft, but the controller itself is wireless. It just uses a USB drive and the cable is just used for charging.
About 10 feet. Give or take.
I bought the controller for my 10 yr.old grandson and he loves it.he likes playing in the dark for the illusion of the light. It was a Christmas gift. I compared it at other stores and it was the same thing but cost more. I recommend the item.
It has a rechargeable battery built in and it also come with a 6 ft. Micro usb
Yes
Its perfect. Nothing more (es perfecto, nada ms)
This controller is just a Dualshock controller. It does not have Sixaxis support
Yes, it does. The feet flip up to raise it approximately 1/2".
It is a wired keyboard. I've been happy with mine; performs great, back-lit keys are nice. Only thing i could even rag on is that i wish the Volume control knob was more sensitive. I have to spin it more than i would like to raise/lower volume. If that's my only complaint, I think you will like this keyboard. Also, I game and have never had a problem with pressing to many keys etc. and it has a windows key disabling function so you don't tab out of your games or anything else. Cheers!
If you consider the volume knob to be a media key, then yes. if not, then no.
Yes it is a USB keyboard. Overall a nice keyboard for the price!
As mentioned previously, the keys are not mechanical, but they feel similar to Cherry MX Brown switches (if you know what those feel like) somewhat tactile, but have virtually no sound.
Yes, absolutely. With the backlight off, it is just like any other keyboard. The characters are clear and a good size.
1 Year limited warranty. Excellent keyboard!
Yes, it is
Can anyone help test it? To test the NKRO functionality, reply to this thread and do the following.. 1. Hold both shift buttons (left and right). 2. While holding both Shift button, Type in the following sentence.. "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" Thank you for the help
no
Over the ear. Thickly padded.
Having the lights on does take a lil from the battery without sacrificing allot of power. Note these are led lights and do not consume not as m much power as you think. But having them off will give you about 30 minutes of extra use after a full charge
No sir. Ours never have. We use them for 2 totally different features but they can be used on the same game ad well! Just perfect for us!
yes, but are overpriced and too fragile
Yes they are compatible with Xbox one. Having said that you'll need to buy the adapter for the Xbox one controller. They are an excellent head set. You'll eenjoy them.
The tower replace it
No
All I can tell you is that I have used the headset for quite a number of hours now and I can't spot any obvious wear and tear on them. Still look and function like new.
It takes less than two hours. The longest I have had it for continued used is 6 to 7 hours. Sometimes less depending on the volume configuration and the light setting.
Yes. Until PS4 patches a third party Ian audio problem, you will have to use the plug to hardwire them into the controller. Cord goes from "line in" on headset to bottom audio jack on controller. The problem reportedly will be taken care of, but while it's not patched it doesn't allow for you to adjust Game-Chat audio OR the volume from the headset. You must use the settings on the ps4 menu to adjust volume and game-chat is standard. The only headset actually in full function with ps4 now that I know of is the PS4 gold headset, but with the patch on the way, this one is an obvious choice for me. Quality is amazing and super cool looking.
On mine the jacks are on the station. They plug into the female port on the front of the controller.
0.8lbs
Yes as soon as you power Down
yes, however, mine only lasted about 3 months before it stopped charging
I have never tried plugging it into a wall outlet, I always charge them off the USB port on my home computer. Mine does light up like the picture shows. I have had this for quite a while and no issues.
I bought this as a xmas gift for my daughter. Alot of people said you can use an adapter and plug it into the wall just as you would a phone.
Yes
I don't know about others but For me it's just perfect...nice product
Yes it works great
Funciona exelentemente, solo es un poco incomodo para colocar los controles
A key for each
no in single player only. No co-op or multiplayer. You might also consider the redux version at this point. It had better graphics and improved gameplay over the original.
Amazon will provide a Steam key for you. :-)
Yes, I have :)

Yes, I have :)
They have an inline Mute swtich, with volume control. There is only one wire leading to the headset.
It's genuine leather and the stitching on the ear cups is superb. Also, the leather is soft to the touch.
Yes. You will need the Microsoft Stereo Headset adapter that plugs into the controller to get game chat(that goes for any headset). This headset comes with a 3.5mm headphone adapter that plugs into Microsoft's Headset adapter on the controller and delivers game audio and chat straight from the controller. This is what I currently use for Xbox One. http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-One-Stereo-Headset-Adapter/dp/B00IAVDOS6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1402548470&sr=8-1&keywords=microsoft+stereo+headset+adapter
Yes
The headsets are very sturdy. They are made of quality materials and because they are designed for gaming they are heavier than traditional sets. The look and feel is outstanding and they are very comfortable (snug) on your ears. Hope this helps.
I did not get a hard case.
No
No
It's not micro usb ... it's actually smaller & has more pins. It plugs into the SteelSeries usb mini-sound card or one of the included headphone/headset adapters. One with mic & headphone connectors or one combined connector for cellphones/ipods.
You just need buy dc adapter for 220v or give current to engineer, they can change from 110v to 220v. Told from my experinece
Yes thank
Yes there is a USB connection.
Go to http://www.xbox360.com (I think that is right link. Going of memory as I'm sitting at a pool. ) then click the support menu. It should be easy from there. I would wait until Monday though.
If you have Xbox 360 with the kinetic device, all you need is good space to dance on.
The Xbox 360 has more games for younger children. The Kinnect allows you to actually connect with other people playing the game. You can limit it to just their friends. It also allows you to do interactive games because the Kinnect bar sees movement. I hope this helps!
The package that I purchased included one controller. I purchased a second wireless controller separately.
Yes (hard drive) if you download games and a lot of apps. Just connect an empty hard drive with usb.
I'm not sure it will work in Europe. The console is NTSC which is made for US and Canada. The power plug is a two prong Input AC 100-127V 3.7A
No the MFR date is 10/06/2012. Thanks for asking.
You can, BUT you will have to buy a different power supply. I bought a 220v power supply through Amazon for about $23. The power supply that comes with the US version is only for 110v.
It has one - we were able to use it with our wireless router immediately.
This bundle has everything he needs to play the system. You will still need an Xbox Live card in order to play online which is $60 a year. If you have a High Definition TV you will also need to buy an HDMI cord in order to play at the highest definition.
you can down load and play more games and shows.
It depends on the bundle! I received a disk with Halo 3, and a code for Tomb Raider. Read the description carefully!
no you do not
Yes
Yes
It was supposed to come with Halo (which it did), a token for Tomb Raider (not there) and a free subdcription to Xbox Live (got that).
Well, It would be better to ask him. Remember to buy the original...
football, baseball,, regular tennis, boxing, darts
Dimensions are as follows: length 11,5 inch (29 centimeters); width 1 feet (31 centimeters); height 7 inch (18 centimeters). The weight is about 3 Kilograms approximately
Yes
no you don't need it to play the game.
The XBox 360 does have access to Amazon Instant Video if you have an XBox Live account and an Amazon Prime account, however it only lets you watch the free videos or ones you have purchased from the website (it does not have a storefront).
get an adaptor set for European plugs.
Yes if it is for Xbox 360
No. You need to buy a converter
You need to activate it
NTSC
yes. it happens to me too rarely though. I suspect is the software and not the keyboard it self. I also use the arrows to drive.
Yes, it have, is really completely, the best mechanical gaming keyboard.
yes you can pretty much bind all keys to anything you want and save it to a profile if you want. The software roccat software is pretty awesome with plenty of options. They make it very easy to change things how ever you like. I even made my T2 key an extra esc key. I definitely recommend this board dude not because of all the lights and flashy things but bc its simply a great keyboard.
The picture on the box is of the German keyboard layout, but U.S. Ordered keyboards will be the standard QWERTY layout an American is used to. I own the keyboard and can confirm this based on personal knowledge.
The roccat Ryos Series keyboards are blue led only. If you want a keyboard that can change the led colors you could get the ROCCAT Isku FX keyboard. The Color of the Cherry Switches (Blue, brown, red, black) does not define the color of the leds.
yes they will work for sure
Yes it does,but you have to use it with the USB sound card and SteelSeries software. The volume for that feature is adjustable.
Synthetic
http://steelseries.com/products/audio/steelseries-cross-platform-audiomixer You need this audiomixer for the steelseries siberia elite to be compatible with your ps4.
No, they are very uncomfortable for long hours of gaming as well.
I have not tried this myself, i use them for the computer. There is no button to use voice control so you would have to hit the button on the phone itself, but the microphone itself is of very high quality. It is mono-directional so background noise would be minimal compared to a wire-mounted mic, and because it sits close to your face the sound of your voice will be very clear. I don't know if the iphone would properly detect the microphone because i have never tried it. I will try it with my Iphone 5S and see if things work as they should. I hope that helps
Either faulty or program
There is a USB sound card that does come with the product. It is not required for use if you want to use the Headset/Mic audio jacks However, if you want to use the software features, you need to have the headset plugged in with the USB sound card. Horrible Google Translation: Hay una tarjeta de sonido USB que viene con el producto. No se requiere para su uso si desea utilizar las tomas de audio Auriculares / Mic Sin embargo, si desea utilizar las funciones de software , es necesario tener el auricular conectado a la tarjeta de sonido USB .
I wouldn't buy these, they mess up or break down very east due to the wiring in the left ear cup. I wouldnt want any cosmetic damage on the ear muffs and as well as the the lighting.
I have a 23.5inch/~60cm round head measuring just above the ears. For me they have held up really well and stay comfortable.
No, it has blue LED lights. No multicolor.
I don't think so, but since Roccat still hasn't released a Windows 8.1 version I can't test it.
yes you can change it to whatever you want each key has its own individual light so be creative lol
Keyboard is qwerty with number pad yes
Yes works fine on my X79 board pre-boot.
There does seem to be some problems with one person I see bashing this product online. Searching this device and 8.1 drivers he has flooded a lot of forums, improperly. I have not one problem with this keyboard, except when playing around 3rd party's lightshow programs. I would have to uninstall Roccat Power Grid (optional software, that allows some lightshows and control through smartphone apps) and re-install drivers and firmware on the keyboard using Roccats updater and things work as normal as when I first got it. I have learned that most other lightshow programs and controls are outlived with support or just are not finished entirely to a well polished transition back to normal. But looking on Roccats website it does in fact support window 8 and further reading on forums indicate that people have been using it with windows 8.1 since driver Roccat 1.30 and firmware version 1.25. I strongly believe it is user error when installing software and hardware, their are instructions on how to do this, like, when to plug in your keyboard when installing this onto your PC, lays a big hand to success.
No, but just get a keycap puller and transfer the keys to the UK layout and remap the keys to the UK layout.
If you are plugging this keyboard into a computer that has usb 1.0 ports, no. If you are plugging a usb 1.0 into one of the usb 2.0 ports on the keyboard, yes.
yes.
I asked a rep and they said it's US layout
We haven't had any problems with it working in Win 7 64. It's recognized immediately as a game controller. Just FYI, from my review "There is a switch with "DP, LS, RS." This is so that the joystick can emulate either the D-pad, Left stick, or Right stick on the PS3 controller. You might have to change this switch dependent on the game."
I've been using the Rea Arcade on PC for a while and I don't have any problems with it.
Totally works, play Guilty Gear all the time with it.
It is square at the diagonal points. I am comfortable with it, but the octagonal plate is easy swap.
Yes, it will come with everything you need to open the box, set it up and start playing. If anything is missing or if something is not working, let us know right away and we'll help you out. You get the same one year limited warranty and the same 30 day return period as all other ASTRO products. Regards, ASTRO Gaming
Yes
I bought a pair a few weeks ago and was blown away at how nice it all is. Everything in the packaging is just like a new headset except the sleeve on the outside of the box says refurbished. There should be no issues with build quality or longevity compared to a new headset.
It should. You may have to update the mix amp on the Astro website. But I didn't buy the pc splitter. So you may have to purchase one sepretly or unless you can find one that comes with it.
It does work but you will need to purchase the xbox one chat adapter to be able to use the microphone.
For the Xbox one. The bass is too loud
Yes. 7.1 Dolby Digital. :) The sound really is magnificent.
Yes it comes with the Mix Amp. I had to follow instructions on a YouTube video because I had issues setting it up. It did not come with instructions.
The mixamp that comes with the headset provides Dolby digital 5.1. I have these and an Xbox one and can attest to this
Yes it should be. Call customer support or even better if they have live chat support let them know. They'll probably have you send the broken cable to them and they will send you a replacement
Hello! Yes, but you will just need to download the driver from Microsoft.
It has Left Stick/Right Stick/D-Pad capability, so it should work. I probably wouldn't suggest using it for a real 3D game but if you want to then go right ahead
it should since my wired 360 controller still works on 8.1
This one is slightly more solid over all the the qanba. It has a standard square gate and the buttons are slightly smaller and smoother also. I own both a qanba and madcatz te stick and if I had to just one for lasting quality and performance it would be the madcatz te. It feels the most comfortable and is the easiest to mod if you so choose.
I think it was 7.8 lbs
No Any Game That Requires the use of both the left and right analog stick it won't work sorry
It responds as any 360 controller would. ive never tried it on fifa, so I don't know if u can map buttons on it. You can probably get a cheaper stick if that is your main use for it. Its a good stick. It has very responsive buttons and handle.
Its a little difficult. The art already on it is one big sticker. You will either have to have something printed with an adhesive backing or buy a plexi top.
3rd party sellers inflating the price since the last run sold out. New pre-orders on the next batch are shipping out August 15th. Prices should go back to normal after that. Retail on the new run of sticks will be $120. Source - http://store.madcatz.com/categories/specialty-controllers-category/Mad-Catz-Arcade-FightStick-PRO-for-Xbox360.html
No, If your looking for a Xbox One fight stick, Madcatz makes the Tournament Edition 2, and Razer makes the Atrox.
Yes, both the PS3 and Xbox360 version are.
Yes. You need a cthulu board for xbox360. It is an absolute pain in the ass from what I hear though.
It's about 3kg!
It is wired.
It's a square gate.
No its just for ps3
It plugs in Via USB to a PS3. It can be dual modded for Xbo 360 as well if you know how o do it or find someone who does.
As long as you have the right drivers installed it should work.
Hmm something is definitely not correct either dimensions. The pro versions is wider a bit but not twice the length. Check YouTube.
no it does not
Yes, we use the balance board from our old Wii. It works great with the Wii U.
No it does not. You can get the wii u fit with board but not sure the meter comes with. I would shop around to see what yiu can find.
No. It will only work with the Wii U system.
Yes, more than one player may play at a time; however, it won't accumulate your data, time, or anything else that we saw. We only tried it once. We took turns back and forth trying to beat each other on a specific game/exercise but it did not keep our results. There is a 2 people run activity, but we have not done that one. Maybe we just weren't doing it correctly.
The listed max weight is 330 lbs. After that point, the game will turn off and not let you use the program. You can work around this limit by putting a layer of cardboard under the board. Just cut out the corners so the legs touch the floor. If you need to reduce weight even more, you can add additional layers or use foam. I have read that the board can support up to 500-600 lbs.
Per my son, he received 60 coins.
There are too many to name. Main ones missing from old Wii version is Skateboard Arena and Parade. The other old ones have been updated for Wii Fit U plus tons of new ones with multi levels.
Yes. It comes with larger pads to put on when used on carpet.
Almost all the exercises do so yes you need one.
Yes.

The balance board itself is compatible with the Wii. However, the Wii Fit U game and fit meter are only compatible with the Wii U.
Yes, we use it on carpet and it works perfectly. There are foot extensions that come with it specifically designed to allow it to work on carpet.
Well, basically the space it takes for the board, and the space for one person standing with the board in front of them (for stepping on and off exercises. 4 square feet? Obviously more would be better.
Yes, it will. That is the beauty of Wii/Nintendo; they always retrofit their games and equipment to the older products, so you don't have to keep forking out cash for every upgrade. Unlike other game consoles.
A Wii U is required to play this. Once you have a Wii U, this box includes everything you need to play Wii FIT U.
Some games do require a Wii Remote with motion plus, and a few games require 2 Wii remotes with motion plus. A lot of games just require the balance board
Yes.
The Balance board should work with your Wii, but nothing else.
The balance board will work for the Wii, the game only works on WiiU

Nope, as long as you get the XTD version, it comes with an external sound card. I highly recommend this headset if you have the dough for it. It's super comfy and sounds insane.
The headset is hardwired into the remote (the remote is not wireless) and the remote plugs into a usb port on your computer
No, There is a button on the base that will either select Speakers or Headset.
Yes
Who said it would work for a PS4? It doesn't. It's specifically for PC. The software to manipulate the voice changer and audio settings are on the PC
Unfortunately the only thing the Bluetooth is able to connect to is a smart phone. As for cable connectivity, it is not intended for consoles. If you want a headset that is surround and for consoles then I would suggest something along the lines of astro, triton, or turtle beach headsets.
Unless you can hear what the other person is hearing(your voice) from their mic then u can't
Yes. Right Click volume icon &gt; volume control options &gt; playback tab &gt; select KAVE XTD Headset &gt; properties &gt; Levels tab &gt; turn microphone up to 100
TLDR - No The entire headset and control module is powered through the USB. Plus, the wire that connects the headset to the control module is permanent. It would be safe to assume that this headset is very much geared towards desktop PC/Mac users.
No
I redeemed the code through Steam.

This is a physical copy, NOT a digital code.
Yes
Yes. 2 additional character slid will open up.
Yes, on the surface it appears that its just one additional act but its a long act. There are also new additions and changes made to the whole game. there is a new character to play thru all 5 acts now. There are minor changes to the gems, one being that they added a new one. to level up the blacksmith and jeweler no longer requires pages or books but deaths breathes. with the changes and the additions it is well worth the money to get the expansion pack just don't get the collectors edition. Once your character makes it all the way thru act v there is this whole other world-Adventurer Mode and rifts to play thru. So to answer your question yes its just one act but there are still so much more to it than just an additional act. If you love D3 then get the expansion you'll love it even more...
The box contains a CD with authentication key for installation, a note pad, several guest passes for other battle net games and a very small instruction sheet on installation. Since you have Diablo III installed all you need is the key to get the expansion.
You can download the software straight from blizzard one you have the serial number. So of you purchase it you simple need to give the key that comes in the box to your friend. You may also be able to purchase it through blizzard as a gift and they will email a key to that person.
You cant. There is no cross server compatability between pc and ps3. So u would have to start from scratch on pc.
Only if you buy multiple copies. Blizzard's policy is one copy, one player. Your wife/husband, girlfriend/boyfriend, children, and friends can not play your copy. It is grounds for account termination.
Yes u can!
Yes
I don't think it will the game system is a pretty tight fit inside there.
The one I received from this company has 12. There are 3 rows of 4 in the case I bought for my son.
no
Yes, you could play it in the case but it might hinder some gameplay
It does have the extra cushion since there is a pocket for games. But to be on the safe side I would take extra caution and put your device in as shown facing in, instead of out in case you do drop it and shatter the screen. My 8 year old is who has the ds and the case, but my 2 year old has tried to get his hands on it from time to time and when told he can not play with it he throws it. And his ds still works!
Yes
Mrs B, just checked with my grandson, and yes, the DS fits "perfectly" in the carrying case. Pamm
Yes. Just the case and the small wrist carry strap.
The actor is Adam Harrington. He's a voice actor who has worked on several video games including telltale's Walking Dead series.
It's a seasonpass for the whole series, but so far only episodes 1 to 3 have been released. As the series continues, the new episodes will be made available to you.
Call Amazon customer support and they will walk you through it.
No, it sadly can't be played through Steam as the DRM says it is for TellTale Games Account. However, Steam is now having a 50% sale of that game. Go get it right now! It's only $12.49! ;)
Easy...you need to first load the Demo....at the end of the Demo it will unlock the other episodes. the DEMO confirms your purchase after it ends

They are not bad at all. The Sanwas seem to return back to neutral faster even though they are a bit easier to push down. If you were going to mod I would recommend replacing the joystick before the buttons. I thought that mod was a major improvement over the stock stick. Hope this helps.
Yup! I am currently running Windows 7 and it works just fine!
On PC its no difference. The q1 is more compact than the other models but all the same premium parts. The q1 also has no mic port. The buttons are rounded so if your playing street fighter 4, you can execute slide techniques great! Its the business!
No
You might have to download the Microsoft drivers that are required to use a basic wired controller. Considering at the base level, it's just a controller. If you google "Microsoft driver 360 wired" you should get it. It's a small download that'll let you use any wired 360 controller.
A little over 5 feet.
It's made for PC as well. But I only use it on my Xbox. If it's a game that uses the stick and dpad you'll have to switch between the mode button on the top row but can't use it simultaneously
It comes with square gate installed and the circular and octagonal gates in the box.
Diagonals work fine for me. Sorry I don't know why it's not working for you.
I am not experienced with doing so because it comes with it. So I would have to strip the wire and add a new one. Which wouldn't look as nice. In all, pretty hard to replace.
Great question, no you do not! All the game of the year stuff is included on the disk so no need to download anything or be hooked up to Xbox Live.
Yes
The new characters are actually on the disc
Ultimate edition has all the new characters and all alternative costumes already unlocked, plus the challenges are unlocked for the new characters. Standard edition doesn't have any of that unlocked.
I don't know from personal experience but my brother says the original game and this game are the same so i hope that helps
Yes. There is an story Mode that follow an interesting storyline
Absolutely!! The game versus mode alone is worth the $20.. There is an original story mode also! It plays identical to Mortal Combat, it is made by the same developers after all!
No sir honest
I assume it would.. If you just download it from the Xbox Games onDemand it will say what all languages it supports! Hope this helps lol
I doubt it. I have had issues, in the past, with purchasing video games from retailers outside my home region. I would strongly recommend that you find a retailer in your home region to buy this from. I can't say for certain that you would have a problem buying this from an American retailer, but I would not risk it.
Yes it does everything is unlocked from characters to modes and etc.
Yes it should have full Latin Spanish but I wouldn't know because I use it in English but the game does have language settings.
Yes
Yes
Mine is in blue.
Yes
no
Yes
Region 1 is printed on the back.
You have to put in codes to get the DLC so it is not recommended that you buy it used.
No. It's just an option to play with people online.
No, sadly, it actually doesn't, the fotus armor was only included in the limited console edition
Rated `M' for Mature... Blood and Violence.
Imdb states that the game has very mild language such as "hell" and "damn" used occasionally.
Yes! In fact it used to be different from other FPS titles such as battlefield and cod. Halo is known for its amazing storyline campaign and its unique multiplayer. It's a start of your intrested in getting into the FPS genre.
There is some mild language, really no further than "damn" or "hell". I really never have understood the "M" rating on the Halo series. However, it is a shooter and thus you will be shooting things and though the violence is a mild form in comparison to other games. It still implies death and I think that is where it gets it's ratings mostly. I really find this game to ne more of a "T" for Teen rating, but then again, maybe I'm just desensitized...
It is rated M mainly for violence. I didn't notice any language while playing.
yes, it comes with all maps (addon); i am a halo fan and I bought this a few months ago and was the best choice and you will save a lot of money instead buying this games separately, so grab it because it worth it
No
It charges till its full then auto shuts off. Problem is after a while, it charges for 30 seconds then shuts off. Seems like batteries die easily. Hope this helps
It plugs into the wall socket
I've always used the nyko chargers. They work pretty well and last a long time.
There are two lights on this device that should be lit whenever a controller is docked. When this device is charging a corresponding light will indicate that controller is being charged by a red or green indicator. When controller is fully charged only a white indicator will be lit when docked.
That I am not sure on. I would contact Nyko on it.
http://www.nyko.com/products/product-detail/?name=Replacement%20Battery%20Kit%20for%20Charge%20Base%20for%20Xbox%20One $7.99 for a new battery
You can charge two engines and one device
Yes, you don't have to keep buying batteries all the time.
I haven't try the Rayovac, I always have NYKO. I believed the battery has a lifetime warranty on it.
You might try best buy or GameStop
At first I thought no, but it actually telescopes out enough for my google nexus 7. It still had about an inch more of telescoping it could do
I have the slim. It works to hold it but it is not extremely secure. I am trying to find a way to make it more secure.
will this clip fit with a bluetooth keyboard attached to the controller as well?
If you put Velcro tape on the Vita and on the Nyko clip, yes. Without Velcro tape, no.
the tablet z3 compact has a width of 4.866 inches, the max that the clip will hold is 6 inches. so yes it should fit/work.
No. Only for phone size.
The clip opens up pretty far, Im sure it would
It sure does. But it rests lightly enough on them that it hasn't been a major issue for me.
Yes it will support phones up to 5.3"
This product is a platform for the PlayStation 4.
I'm sorry this won't answer your question, but for both to break within 6 months seems that it could be a defective product or batch. I've had mine for quite a while now, and my fingers never come across touching or bumping the dongles (and I have large hands). I have never had an issue sliding them back into their base. They work amazingly. I wish I knew where I put the original packaging to see what the warranty was, but it will NEVER hurt to contact them and explain your situation. Nyko has been great about handling defective accessories. If you have the documents that came with the unit, contact them. If not, you probably can find their customer service connection on their website to address the situation. I hope this helps a little. ~C
You can get them direct from Nyko. Just search online for it. I think they're five bucks but may cost shipping. They aren't available anywhere else that I can see.
Yes it will stop charging once the controller has fully charged
Its not possible to mount the base due to the way the controller are setup (gravity) Check out my review video on it youtube.com/deejaystech
The charge base doesn't, however Nyko makes a battery pack that is compatible with this base that does and it works very well. The wonderful thing about the charge base is you don't have to fight with the micro USB plug to recharge your controller. You plug the dongle in and it's the last time you have to deal with that stupid plug.
I would not recommend it. Thank you for asking.
Nope works with gravity hahaha its the only thing making the pins charge the controller there is no clip o holder just gravity
No it's designed to be plugged into an outlet.
It is an AC unit that uses dongles connecting to the PS4 controller. Then all you need to do once the dongles are connected to the PS4 controller is sit it on the charger base. I like the design a lot and don't ever have to worry about scratching up the area around the charge plug anymore now.
Not sure...the charger has a little plastic adapter piece that fits onto the controller. It's fits pretty tight on the controller. If your case is very thick...I don't think it will work.
Yes Sandra.
It's one code. You enter in to the xbox 360 and it downloads, and then you go I cod ghosts in the Xbox one store and it will be free. So you get both versions
Although I am not sure if it will work on a foreign account. I'm pretty sure it will though. The code does not get emailed, it is shipped to the address that you put in for the order. Enjoy! It's a great game.
No, You can only activate the game on one Xbox live account. So if you activate it the Xbox 360 copy on your account, the same account will be allowed to download the Xbox one edition. You can sign into your friends Xbox one and play from there, but he wont own the game.
You have to download it to your xbox 360 first. Then it will be available for free on your xbox one. If your consoles share the same xbox live account.
If you mean as soon as you pay for it no. It will be sent to you in a plastic case with a download code for ghost xbox one and 360. It took at least 3 to 5 days to receive the codes.
Sorry we cannot.
Yes
I already shipped this back to you. It was a quick turnaround back to you. I shipped it back the same way that you sent this to me. It was a return to sender package. You did not have the disc inside.
Once you redeem it on 360. Search for the game on the xbone store. Should be a free download
The game looks amazing....the story line is short and its the actions are limited and repetitive. It would be a lot cooler if you could venture off into the world but you can't.
for all xbox one games go to xbox one settings, network then click go offline and all games install faster however when you enable this again youll have an update for the game but its still faster to install
Not really. You have a sword and a shield, "X" uses your sword and "Y" uses the shield. There really aren't combos to speak of other than going back and forth with a combination of your sword and shield. Some enemies require a "heavy" attack where you hold in "X" or "Y" and it will break their guard. You hit"B" to do a roll move, which you will need to do for some enemies. It's a beautiful game though and the multiplayer is pretty fun if you have a friend to play with. Worth it if you can find it used.
no all positive language
This game is played via controller only though one has the ability to control legions with voice commands via Kinect.
Usps first class!
Every time you have to finish an enemy off he glows the color of the buttons you have to press, so its basically lots quick time events without the actual buttons showing up on the screen, But you will be doing Very short quick time events throughout the whole game.
No you can hold LB instead of using Kinetic during the speaking parts like "fire volley" etc
Unfortunately, there is currently no indicator for Xbox One exclusives on the game covers themselves. I would recommend using a guide such as this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Xbox_One_games.
Yes it does. No LAN play though. :( which seems to be a thing of the past these days.
Yes, the 2015 mustang is a free dlc
Yes
No steering wheel needed. I personally like to play on the controller since I am used to it but if you really want to, there is a wheel for the xbox one called the Thrustmaster TX Racing wheel that you can buy for about 200 bucks. And there are also some optional add ons. But no, you dont need a wheel.
I'm not too sure about that one. I know the game supports many languages but I can't say for sure if Korean is one of them.
Can't earn all of them...gotta buy with real money...sucks.
No
A lot of what this game does well to set itself apart from previous installments is features such as drivatars, new vibration system, improved physics, and advanced visuals. These things are for the most part probably not possible on the 360, so what would be the point to release Forza 5 with less content and features on last gen without these new additions to the franchise? I really don't see any.
Yes. The game will switch to split screen. However, you can not play online with two people using the same xbox.
No. Forza Motorsport 5 is only playable on the Xbox One entertainment system. Forza 4 and Forza Horizon are two racing games, from the same franchise, that are available on the Xbox 360.

There are a few instances, especially at the end, where prior knowledge of the Dead Rising universe lore would be helpful for understanding the plot twists. However, you could still play the game and have a great time without prior knowledge of characters or meta plot.
You can only play DR3 on Xbox One and not on the Xbox 360. This game takes full advantage of the Xbox One's new hardware, especially the Kinect.
No
Well it depend on you. If you really enjoy play "kill zombies" or something. I like this game. I not really play this game a lot. I love build new gadget, vehicles, and ETC. If you play deadrising 2 and you like it then you will love deadrising 3. I promise.
Other players can joint your world, or you can join theirs. There is no split screen.
It installs the same amount whether you get a hard copy or a digital. Only difference is you're pulling from a disk rather than downloading it using your Internet speed so it goes faster(unless you have blazing Internet speed). There may be a slight difference, but not enough to choose one or the other.
yes online you can play but for first timers I recommend that they should play single player mode before trying two player being you can only use two player mode with another xboxone lat leas as far as I know
Yes
No. Did you read Japan Import? Is $20 more because it is imported. Sony announced that they will release the wave blue in US for 60 bucks in the fall.
Yes. Our inventory is 100% original products of Sony Computer Entertainment.
Thank you asking. Package; Nylon bag (water proof) and New cardboard box Cushioning material (paper etc) And This item is New. Best regards.
That's right. It is a product that Sony has produced.
The mouse does change colors. However the click wheel has 5 main color presets and can not change (green,red,blue,purple,yellow, maybe pink too?). But the numbers and the logo will change to any color you can think of with an amazing color palat that lets you change the brightness, hue, contrast,ect. You can even do black lol! Hopefully that answers your question
Hey J, I found the software nomenclature to be a bit confusing. Mode, was not clearly defined. This turned out to be your profiles. They are selected with a button on the bottom of the Venus mouse. Each of the five different profiles (mode 1-5) has an indicator color which lights the scroll wheel. In the profile setup you have a series of five DPI presets each with a pair of sliders for x and y axis. Generally you would want the x-y to be parallel. But for a special program use you may want it slow left and right and fast up and down. In that case the x-y sliders would not be parallel. These are selected from within the current profile (mode) with the up-down arrows behind the scroll wheel. This will light up a series of 1 to 5 lights on the top of the mouse indicating which DPI setting you have engaged. You may like 5 lights but prefer a slower setting just pull the x-y sliders down to the desired setting in the 5th DPI.
The thumb buttons are mechanical keys. They also have a curvature for quick button finding. There is #1-#12 keys.
Yes it is smooth plastic. It feels very good when u touch it. :)
Nope, they are extra programable keys.
You should be able to bind them to anything, usually it binds to keyboard key(s), anything in photoshop that can bind to key(s) is thus covered by this.
This is for sure the same mouse in a different body. The Perdition has the same weight system as well. If debating between the two mice I say it comes down to the cosmetics and the need for a thumb rest or not. Even the software for both mice are identical aside from the logo of course. I think I want them both, at such a low price point I don't see why not. What really gets me is this mouse info states it's been on Amazon since late 2013. Mind boggling as I've been looking for a true alternative to the G600 and Naga for such a long time now.
It is easy to start up and easy to use to set up the keys. The starting keys itself is already fine meaning you don't need to set up all your mouse bindings if you don't mind a standard mouse set up with the side keys 1-12 being hotkeys for the 1-12 numbers of your keyboard and if you want to change any of the bindings an image on the in software key set up will show you what option corresponds to what on your mouse making it really straight forward. Its been a super easy time using it in general.
There is a quick button on the bottom of the mouse is cycles through the profiles in order. You can assign a color to each profile so you can easily see which one your on. You do have to pick it up to do it but I think you can also assign a button on the top of the mouse to switch profiles.

I would say 7 and older they have to know the essentials of farming to understand the game though it's complexed like planting spraying and combining crops!
no they the cows mile themselfs. they walk through a automatic milking machine
No its not its farming simulator2013 2015 hasn't come out for 360 yet
My son said , to pick up eggs just walk over them. Use a hay bailer and place in pasture or stalls to feed cows. Hope this helps
Yes
Your chickens are in one spot and you cannot change where or how they are kept. The cows are fed buy grass, straw and chaff that you collect and have to mix for the best feed. As far as organic farming, you either use fertilizers bought and filled on your farm or get it from raising cows. There are you two choices. This is a limited game.
No there is not
The only business involved is running your farm, improving with better equipment, keeping out of debt, there is not a way to set prices but there are demands for crops that pay higher prices during limited times.
On your farm there is a place you pull up to on the left side where you can park your equipment under the long shed. You also can fill your fertilizers up on the right side of same shed. Hope that helps if not use the walk through section of the game and they show you how to do it.
It is very realistic..and fun to play

Same thing! Just looks different.
Yes
It comes in the for of a card with a scratch off behind it revealing the code. The card should come directly from the seller.
No KMA
Only for USA People.
The item will be shipped.
Yes the game works 100% lucky me I didn't know it was the EU version only thing that does not work is any PSN codes u get as they are EU only: /
you cant get the downloadable content. my boyfriend is able to play it just fine in the US. only downside is you have to download all of the games except AC3 onto the harddrive and it takes up a lot of space. wish I would have just bought them all separate now
i really dont know, i havent played yet
No ps4 is not backwards compatible, found that out firsthand unfortunately
yes
Hola Luis, Sorry... only single player in Amrica and latn america
With the systemI got everything HDMI cable and only one controller, if u need another controler u have to buy it, im happy it works really good , and it was brand new , no flash memory card included !! Any question feel free to ask
Yes you can
some listed for sale on amazon do but some will not. i have one listed and it does not include the stand but you can still set it on it's side.
Yes. And blue rays
Yes
Yes, But my only complaint is this model does not have eject disc. It is only manual open. Other than that, it is a fantastic game console. Works great, have had no problems and looks Kool too.
This ps3 unfortunately does not have backwards compatibility for ps2. Ps1 games however work great still.
Yes you can surf the internet. It a little difficult because there is no keyboard tho I would recommend to buy one
It can rest horizontally.
The controller uses built-in batteries that are charged via a USB-type chord to the machine. It blinks when the battery is low. I prefer it to the xbox controller and I have both.
Yes
No it will wprk with the controller
Yes you can set number of laps
you get points for each finishing position, so Kevin had more top 5's pr top 10's than you did over t he season
I believe it is but the screens are extremely small... Very difficult game to play at first but extremely realistic!
I don't know I haven't tried it ,sorry
Yes when you set the race up you can turn the cautions off under the flag options.
No..only single season...
It has every track on this years Sprint Cup Schedule.

You prob need to update the video card on your computer..

It now includes all the expansions except Warlords.
Yes, it's the same as the digital download on Blizzard's website except that it also comes with a nice starter's guide that details the classes and races and some basics of the game. It includes one free month of game time, as well as the first 3 expansions (Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, and Cataclysm.) This bundle does not include the newest expansion Mists of Pandaria.
This is the one that you have to start with. The rest of them are expansion packs you add to this original software. When I purchased this I thought I was getting the version in the picture (the newest release date version) but was sent the original box version. From my understanding there isn't much difference and I did make the company that ships this aware of it. Customer service was IMPECCABLE. They were very prompt and courteous in emails.
I recommend going to us.battle.net and making your purchase there for a good digital copy. I am not sure if the digital copy is available through amazon. I also did not look though.
Yes it does.
It has a Lot of commands and sub commands that xbox windows controller won't be enough'
In this case you should buy Mist of Pandarian as well. So the pandaren character would be included. Now since you played a trial I really don't know if your character will be deleted. I'm a new player on WOW and I was requested to create an original character from the initial game at lvl 50it will allow you to create other characters from the other expansions
You get the game, code and free game time
Windows,Mac,Linux
you boost from 1 to 90 instantly, but professions aren't level to max unless you have your character over lvl 60.
It now includes all the expansions except Warlords.
Yes, it's the same as the digital download on Blizzard's website except that it also comes with a nice starter's guide that details the classes and races and some basics of the game. It includes one free month of game time, as well as the first 3 expansions (Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, and Cataclysm.) This bundle does not include the newest expansion Mists of Pandaria.
This is the one that you have to start with. The rest of them are expansion packs you add to this original software.

Yes, it happend to me a couple weeks after I bought it. Also, I could not down load new updates.
My kids installed it, so I didn't get a chance to see the exact amount after format, but even with their profiles and some game stuff saved, I still thought I saw 58g free of the 60
This item is specifically for the SLIM because of its design. This drive inserts into the body of the slim through a door that opens on the end. It slides in and attaches and you shut the door back. This would not work on any other xbox.
There is a small door on the side of the console that pops open. If you don't already have an internal hard drive it will be empty and this one just drops right in.
yes this will work fine
if that means the xbox slim than yes
Hey, yes it does!
Hey, Our Xbox One Phantoms are only available through the KontrolFreek website at this time.
No
It comes with two grips for both analog sticks. Just like any other Kontrol freeks i personally use a cqc on the left analog since it is shorter
Yes it is. It gives you great aiming with sniping and any other weapon.
No
I'm pretty sure that they will work.
They are a tight fit on my controller, but I did get them to fit. I have a Microsoft brand wired controller, along with 4 wireless controllers and they fit them all.
Nope there Slick As hell Smooth movements/Aiming Worth the 15$ even without the regular Cover C:
Of course, I use it on my ps3 and it really improve my accuracy. Once you get use to it you will think that the thumb stick are more shorter than before you use kontro freak
Yes it does!
when bought brand new? Yes. if bought used, then it may or may not. But, the point is if it's brand new, then it should come with everything it's supposed to.
Yes. Register the device with Nintendo. It can be transferred, from card to card, but I was unsuccessful. (even tried calling Nintendo support) Fortunately, once your device is registered, you can download the game for free from the eshop.
Yes, it comes with its own charger, original for 3ds as any other bundle... About the dsi car charger I don't know if it works... You could try thou. Greetings
No. Just 110v
I don't know about all of them, but I do know that mine did NOT. Was a little disappointed by that, as I assumed by the photo your talking about that it would come with that download. My didn't though!
The bottom screen is touch-enabled, and generally it works really well, even without the stylus. A lot of 3DS games make use of the bottom screen in all sorts of novel ways, and some of that requires a finer point than just your finger can offer.
The screen on the 3ds xl is supposed to bigger than the dsi xl screen.
Check to be sure the listing says New. If it's new & unopened you should receive it in it's original Nintendo packaging (factory sealed) with all the included accessories & manual. If it's new & unopened (factory sealed) it is Never Shrink-Wrapped. I know this to be a fact because I worked in the Nintendo (formerly Pokmon) store in NYC & all factory sealed boxes come with a special stickers on each end that when peeled open even gently it is obvious that it was unsealed to prevent tampering, etc. This is also true for all the other gaming consoles (XBox 360 XBox One, PS3 & PS4, Wii & Wii U, etc, even the old game systems & handhelds from years ago). All retail employees can tell if it was opened & will not take it back unless of course you are selling it back as used for way less even if it was just purchased 5mins prior. Good luck everyone.
SHDC is a SD Card with better read speed( works better) for digital games or files in 3DS, R4 card it's an illegal product for play piracy games of DS in 3DS with 1 micro SD card, The SHDC, you can find it anywhere like this http://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Gaming-Digital-Nintendo-SDSDG-004G/dp/B004DWQLTK/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&qid=1401073580&sr=8-13&keywords=r4+3ds , The R4 can find in other markets if you want, not here, but be carefull, some websites are fake and nintendo 3DS firmware blocks R4 firmware in every update They make and not all R4 cards update his firmware for solve that problem.

yes
Yes it does, the game is downloadable as well, which means when you connect to WiFi the box will give you a downloaded code for you to download from the Nintendo Store and will have it in a couple minutes.
Yes, this unit can play 3DS and DS games (but not game boy advance cartridges).
The charger is rated for 120 volts and 110 volts at 60hz. It has the standard two flat parallel prongs, but one is not bigger than the other.
What it will give you is a download code, you'll go to the online store, input the code and it will download to your system.
No, the item does not include the download code.

Same exact game. Different characters.
Yes however it may be cheaper to get a used set from starter pack rather than buy them a-la-carte!
Dark edition is a starter kit and comes with the base and game plus 5 dark edition skylanders.
Yes, I have the regular game and my brother has the Dark Edition and we have no problem using the characters with either game.
Sorry hut we are not shipping internationally at this time. IWD
Yes. The portal and the game is the same as the regular swapforce.

It could help but it is not necessary. Entirely different story.
I just checked and the game has options for both audio and subtitles but it seems like it's linked to your system setting so I had to change my entire system region over to Spanish but then it showed access to both the English and Spanish audio and subtitles.
About 5lb.
This edition Includes the beanie
yeah, its take some force to adjust to fit your TV. i was scared at first but its a lot more durable then you think it it.
So that if you wish for the camera on the kinect not be able to see you you can put it on. The camera is always on if the kinect is on and sees the whole room.
No, it isn't required. The Kinect sensor is bundled with most Xbox One consoles (it was required with mine but you can buy the console without the Kinect now). Research the Kinect. It's cool. I have young kids so I didn't want them to play with the Kinect so I bought this to mount it up high. The Kinect can sit by the TV but it looks like it belongs on top, with this bracket installed.
I have not removed the mount off of my television, but there is padding on the mount. I guess that should prevent any scratching on the front of the television.
Curve shouldn't be a problem. The kinect can be tilted up and down there is a hinge
You can point the mount down if the kinect is not catching everything. You should be ok
Yes. It has a stand that you have to be very gentle pulling it out. Once you pull it out put on your TV and adjust it.
No
Yes most definitely i have mine set ontop of a 24 inch monitor. the only question is if it can hold the weightof thekinect wihtout tipping over your monitor. Mine can, howevr i do not now how much yours can hold. the mount is super light so really just take into consideration the weight of the kinnect and make your decision from there.
The mount is only adjustable to make it sit on the TV properly. Once the Kinect is mounted, you can still tilt the sensor as you normally would, but your view range is dependent on the distance. I got the mount because my living room is smaller and putting it on my TV allowed it to see more of the room. Once you move it, you can recalibrate the sensor to the new position through the Kinect settings. In this sense it worked for me, but it depends on your set up. Does this help?
Yes
Just Elsa and Anna. Rapunzel is separate. Jasmine can only be used with Infinity 2.0
You need to buy the new game Disney 2.0 which comes with the new portal. Characters from 1.0 will work on the new 2.0 portal.
It is the best offer I have seen, it will match Walmart pricing and you get the extra coins.
Yes, all figures can be used in Wii U, if you have the Wii U Infinity Base.
Yes. They all come in their original packaging as you would find them in retail stores.
Yes, but this bundle contains most of the figures.
The more figures you have the different scenes and adventures you can play. Each character has their own world the more you have the more you can unlock.
These are add on pieces. In order to play you need the starter pack which includes three characters, game and activation base. These work for every game system that you have the base and game for.
While the characters work in the "toy box" portion of the game, you can not use the levels in 1. you need to keep 1.0 to play the original games.

I got it for new battlefield as it needed hard drive (I have Xbox 360 with 4gigs). Worked good, it extends your memory so I don't see a reason why it wouldn't work with original games
It's for a system not a game
Basically, yes, it is inserted in the top of the Xbox when you remove the slats. This one is for Xbox 360 slim.
To answer your question I will give you the difference between the deluxe vs console. basics: Memory: Basic: 8GB / Deluxe: 32GB Color: Basic: White / Deluxe: Black hardware: * Basic: 1 GamePad, Wii U sensor, HDMI cable * Deluxe: 1 GamePad, two power adapters, HDMI cable stand for Wii U, charging dock GamePad Game included: Elementary: None / Delux: Land Nintendo or Super Mario Bros Price (U.S.): Basic: 299,99 dollars / Deluxe: 349,99 dollars * The Deluxe version has Nintendo Network Premium (give discounts to download games for 2 years). As for graphics will be the same, both have 2GB of RAM and will run games with resolution up to 1080p (Deluxe version has more storage capacity, but not more powerful)
You can play Wii games on it but not Gamecube games!
No, it does not play DVD or Blu-Ray movies, nor does it play audio CD's. It will only run Wii U and Wii software (including titles downloaded from eShop and virtual console).
hard copy, one disk of both games.
Both games are on one disc. http://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/QzGKZgfv5oFkGY0J9CZ3hgnyOwH4KBqo
32GB
You can tranfer all of your old downloaded games from your wii to your wiiu as long as you have an SD card (this will also wipe everything off your wii). The wiiu has a "wii mode" that just looks like the old wii home screen, from there you can play your transferred games and old wii game disks.
That is not a Wii console (last generation) that is the Wii U console (current generation). The Controller is the pad on the left in the picture with the Wii U logo on the screen. So just to be clear this does not include a Wii this is a new console called the Wii U. It will play Wii games, but will not play the Gamecube games like the Wii was able to do.
5 people can play at a time (depending on the game). That requires purchasing 4 more controllers or using old Wii controllers. Most people seem to prefer the Pro controllers to the Wiimote. A lot also love the included gamepad, but only 1 of those is supported.
To be honest I don't know I don't play that long. I bought the nyko pro controller and I could always use that if the game pad ran out. It's a great controller and 20 bucks
This version of j stars victory vs is region free meaning it works on the US vitas as well as Japan vitas
It doesn't have english subtitles I've found but you can find translations of menus online Easily. I've tried to connect to online and it has not proved feasible. Maybe you can find a way. There are many configurations and every time I get to the competitor confirmation screen, it takes me back to the previous screens so I suppose that is a decline.
Yes he is
Nop

It just means its on a vita cartridge not a digital download
2592 kb with the game disc
Does not support. . . .
Yes
No official word of any GoW PS4 title, possibility that all the GoW games will be available when PlayStation Now officially releases to the public and im guessing the definition of the original will be the resolution from PlayStation Now streaming service .
They need to be stretched to fit the screen. They were originally shown in a 4:3 format.
It is in english but there are very few talks in the game.
Yes but with only a limited amount of games
Not that i know of
I heard that Fire TV has a speical keycode for the controller so maybe F2 doesn't work with it. Sorry we are not 100% sure.
Yes
I googled S5 showing the S5 is with 4.8" screen. It fits the holder, which can support 8.2cm maximum.
YES, It work with Mac book.
Hello, yes it does work with iPhone or any device with Bluetooth
Sorry, no.
I don't think you can.
Yes they are, although the text in the game and menus are all in english.
It has a bonus High School Mode.
You get to read a manga style comic book. You will get to make some desicions that will affect the outcome. You may wanna check out some game play video on you tube.
It is basically the same as the PSP game Hakuoki:Demon of the Fleeting Blossom, but it has other features and a bonus game that you can unlock.
All regions
I'm not a sophisticated gaming user, but I have a fingertip grip and it works OK for me. Note that the side buttons (on the left side of the mouse) are probably better placed for a palm grip. As with any mouse, you're best off trying it in a store before buying if at all possible.
if you have hands bigger than 7 inches, go for it.
i dont have a g500 but I do have g400s and DA,rival has the same LOD as g400s which is pretty low.

It's a clicker, but it's a very loose click. There are gradations in the wheel, but it's still very easy to scroll with little actual force.
It can be remapped, but you can't map it to be a continuous hold. It can be mapped to a one-off macro of keystrokes in the driver. Could be used as a toggle for voice activation or microphone mute, but not the traditional PTT.
I have about 700 hours in CS:GO, I have this and the Steelseries XXL mousepad I think it's called, tracking is absolutely perfect though the mouse is a tad bit on the large+heavy side. I'm 5'6" and have medium hands if you were curious.
Yes, it should work with most if not all Mac OS versions.
Yes, its a great mouse if you know how to set up the dpi right + config to use the side buttons.
Yes
Yes. There is an entire campaign/story mode that is single player only.
Unfortunately it does NOT come with the pre-order bonus. Which sucks, since I ordered this in March. I had to buy the DLC separately on July 16th.
No. Only online co-op.
A steam account, is an account on this page http://store.steampowered.com/. You can download a software there that allows you to install games to your computer and play them from this software platform. Games from steam usually come at great discounts. Imagine downloading a playstation interface to your computer. It's like having a playstation account. Instead it's from a provider called Steam, and thus it is a Steam Account.
yes it does - have fun!
Yes, once you already downloaded it, the game as well as your saves, are saved onto your hard drive. So you can definitely play it offline.
should work. just make sure you have a good virus program. this hit me pretty good. but needs to be fixed asap. everything is fine...
No. It's boring and annoying. What could have been a fun and immersive experience is bogged down by necessary game scenarios (hit three switches) and after the monster finds you and kills you a few times, the game turns from scary to annoying and frustrating. The fact that you have no weapons to fend yourself off makes things scary at first, but eventually becomes just lame because only being able to run pads out the game since you have to retrace your steps again once a chase is over. It wasn't fun at all and I never finished it.
No, this game only comes as a downloadable title, so you would lose a big part of your monthly allowance simply by downloading it.
Its a steam code. You purchase it here on amazon, go figure lol. But this game though lol. This game i dont recommend for the faint hearted.
I don't know I just used a mouse but don't see why not that's just my opinion though. Hope this helps
No. You HAVE to buy it separately.
You can click to save, but I don't believe it will save it right there, I do believe it will just return you to the checkpoint. I could be wrong though, I usually just use the checkpoints haha

The fact that you have no weapons to fend yourself off makes things scary at first, but eventually becomes just lame because only being able to run pads out the game since you have to retrace your steps again once a chase is over. It wasn't fun at all and I never finished it.
No, this game only comes as a downloadable title, so you would lose a big part of your monthly allowance simply by downloading it.
Its a steam code. You purchase it here on amazon, go figure lol. But this game though lol. This game i dont recommend for the faint hearted.
I don't know I just used a mouse but don't see why not that's just my opinion though. Hope this helps
No. You HAVE to buy it separately.
You can click to save, but I don't believe it will save it right there, I do believe it will just return you to the checkpoint. I could be wrong though, I usually just use the checkpoints haha
Yes this fits the new one
Mine took around 8 hours to charge.
Yes when attached it charges the PS Vita first then the Battery in the Grip. It is advised to power the PS Vita off if you want it to fully charge.
I have not noticed this at all. Maybe your unit is defective?
Yes! AmazonBasics case, have it myself and it fits perfect. Even room for the some extras, like headphones, a cleaning cloth and some games or SD cards. Some nice pockets inside to store them in. Link to item:
No. You have to remove the Vita or wait for the battery to run down on the grip.
2800mAh Vita battery : 2200mAh It quite good grip, perfect fit in the hand, but durability is really awful
It is made for the 2000 model. I've been using it and its absolutely perfect! great grip! only gripe would be getting accustomed to hitting R2 and L2 on the back panel. Before I was always hitting it by accident, which doesnt happen now with the power grip. But now the R2 is a bit harder to reach. For example, I cant have my finger ready at R1 and hit R2 at the same time. I run into this problem when playing borderlands.
Memory card yes, game slot no.
Yes it's a battery pack 2extra hrs of play, and 2gen vita

definitely. the only real things that may feel the same is the overworld map being almost identical in a lot of areas and the overall playability. which isnt a bad thing. its very smooth and fun to play. the dungeons are all different. a lot of cool new puzzles and weapons etc. i think you'd have a lot of fun with this if you're a fan of the original.
The game is for everyone.
I don't believe so. Sorry.
You need a 3DS to play it
Nope. You need a 3ds
Just go back into that save file play some and save then it will be your new save for that file. That is the only way I know how.
Nintendo games are region locked, so I'd lean toward "not compatible." I'm not sure exactly where you look for definitive proof though.
No.
He can only be controlled with the circle pad
Yes. All 3ds games are compatible with the 3ds xl and 2ds models.
Sorry, but in my case, the disc doesn't came with the console. Really shame. Amazon must be send me this game.
Yes
Si viene en espaol e ingles
It comes with the red yellow and white audio video cords. You should be able to buy or use a ps ps2 RCA connector with it.
Yes it does. It plays them perfectly
No.
Very good
It came with the last of us, batman arkham origins, the controller, the PS3, and the red whit yellow audio video cords. There was no hdmi cord included.
No
As said in the description its a 250gb console
Yes of course. I cant remember any wii games cant play on wiiu, Btw get mario kart bundle better
This is the 8GB set. You may want to have an HDD or flash drive if you buy the 8GB set. Space gets eaten up VERY quickly. After the installation of the huge update you're left with a little over 2GB
Hi, yes you can. I'm using a SD card on my Wii U and it works fine.
The Wii U has all the major streaming services, but it can't play any discs.
With the basic set your 2gb has to cover game saves for wii u games and downloads However the easy solution is get a usb 3.0 powered hdd from amazon and exponecolly expand your very limited storage with a 2-3 TB hdd you can even dl full games from e-shop want smash faster dl it the day of release. Best advice get a external powered hdd.
One person can play a game on the game pad and the other person can only watch actual TV program.
I believe the stated maximum is 32GB, but I would expect that it would support twice that (as many devices do). If you're you're considering using a large flash memory card as game storage ... commercial flash memory has a limit on the number of times you can write over it is not recommended as devices for long-term storage of downloaded games or save data. You can get an inexpensive external hard disk drive for around the same $30/$40 as many large capacity SD cards. An 80Gb or 160 Gb drive can be purchased for under $30.
The system has 8.
No, this was the best wii deal I found on internet. Go for it, I love mine.
Yes
Yes you can play with 1,2,3 or 4 players.
Its totally normal, the manual is online
Not sure about the move , Currently the PS4 does not support Sounds of the show because there is no Audio software .
Amazon should email you a code in which you have to input that at the skinit website, the link to that website is also included in the email
I think they please Canadian customers putting the picture of a Canadian player (or a Canadian team, for istance Toronto) on the cover. the game is exactly the same.
I don't believe this or any other game has cross platform play at this time, not 100% sure though.
Idk
Just the controller

Yes, with the season pass you have the access to skill bundles too.
Depending on the game, it can be added content on top of the regular game. There called DLC's or downloadable content. New missions, maps etc.
If you purchased Season Pass from US region and didn't match with your game region (I meant EU Region2) so Season Pass is not work. Because my friend have ever used Season Pass from US but their game is different region too. If you have any further question don't hesitate to ask. :)
nop, you cant the game and the seasson pas has tobe of the same region. Game EU seasson Eu... Or Game USA Seasson USA
It's just the DLC for the game
Yes it will, it's just DLC (downloadable content) that will add maps and other upgrades to your experience
no sry
You should Enter this code to reddem code section.
If the previous games worked, then this should also
Yes, It will. Premium is just an Add-on to the Game, like an unlocking key. And You've already bought "US" Digital games...
If you bought the game in the amazon store the first time, the DLC should work to..
U get it forever. Battlepacks are linched in a time span so it refers to it
two
No, just for american region.

Although, some people have uploaded rosters with them on it that are free to download
I am not sure on this particular game as I have not played online yet. I did download a roster that I liked better than what the game had, but usually they give you a code that works or the playstation store has a free one. When I went into the online screen on accident it acessed it and did not mention anything about needing an online pass.
Yes
Yes, the roster it's updated every week
Players regularly retire, however it is the players that would expect, i.e. late thirties, lack of ability, etc. In RTTS I have noticed that the AI makes what I can only call, ridiculous trades. You'll see your stars get traded away early in the season for scrubs, or minor league "talent." In RTTS you will see some player retire earlier than expected. The unrealistic trade logic does impact franchise mode as well. Since Kershaw is under 35 I would presume that he would be good for quite a few years. I caution you in purchasing this game. If you can get a good deal on the cost, go for it, otherwise be warned as the AI is terrible in this game. The fielding mechanics are not what they were in previous MLB games and lead to a lot of frustration. The other major glaring issues in this game is that you will be picked off at will by the AI, your pickoff attempts WILL go into the stands at least once a game, and the online portion of this game has not worked since the game was released.
Yes
I myself could not afford ps4 but bought mlb 14 for ps3. So far online play was extremely bad. Very choppy online play. Issues with responsiveness and graphics issues. If I knew that I would have just kept playing mlb13 and then upgrade to ps4 next year after the bugs are out.
no but what would you want no blu ray, the console plays blu ray
yes theyare good

Yes, this works on Windows 8 (and 8.1).
Yes, you should be able to do so. I haven't tried it, but the point of a cloud based game is that you can play anywhere. It may get a bit more complicated if you want to play the same offline city on both though.
You can change the language. I believe you can select your language when you install it.
This includes both the main game and the expansion.
Yes. The game has two modes. A Single Player mode and Multiplayer mode. Multiplayer requires an Internet connection. You will NOT be able to play multiplayer mode on LAN. The multiplayer mode requires an internet connection with an Origin account, while Simcity is updated to the latest version. In Multiplayer mode, you can create a game or even join other games. A game refers to a region where you have multiple cities. You could invite friends and your son to play in the same region. Since you want to play a multiplayer game with your son, I am assuming you would be purchasing the game once. The game purchase can only be registered with a single Origin account. A single Origin game account allows you to install the game on multiple PCs with the same account. This would technically allow your son and yourself to play the game with this account on different PC's. However, a single account can only be logged in once. Meaning, both of you cant play at the same time. So in order to play the game at the same time, you would need to purchase the game twice, have two separate Origin accounts, one for yourself and your son. This would allow multiplayer at the same time. The other mode is the single player mode. This mode does not require a persistent Internet connection to play. The game data will be stored on your PC rather than on Servers. For the single player mode, you can play the game even though your Orgin account is in offline mode. I am assuming this may allow you and your son to play a single player game without internet on two different PCs at the same time as long as the origin account is set to offline mode on both the PCs. I could be wrong though. Hope This answer helped.

Install Steam and activate the game within steam. Download the steam client here: store.steampowered.com
You can use your keyboard. I use it too, but it's not comfortable. When you want to do a bigger combo, it is impossibble to make it succesfull. So I recommend controller to play.
Ofcourse you can
I have a wired xbox 360 game controller, I just plugged it in the USB port of my computer and the game automatically recognized it. It also asks you when you about to play a match to Press the Accept Button on the controller you want to use, so I've had no problems using the xbox 360 controller for this game. Not sure how a wireless controller would work.
Yes it does through steam. It has same screen multi-player but No LAN support though...
YEP as long as your normal audio works This should work As always get the latest drivers for your audio card Check settings in game
http://steamcommunity.com/app/242700/discussions/0/630800444807741352/?l=spanish i think they do

They redeem on steam, which does not carry mac versions of the sonic games. You can see the list here, listing only windows as supported. http://store.steampowered.com/sub/26498/
Yes
I haven't played every game but I know that adventure 1 & 2 , generations, and both racing games support gamepads
Not necessarily. I can run Steam on my pc, but not COD: Ghosts because my Windows version is not 64-bits. That being said, I have the pack and all the games run fine on my Windows 7 PC, I don't believe you will have an issue.
The pack is played through steam so you'll need to have an account with them first before downloading the game. All of this requires an internet connection but to actually play the games there should be an offline mode in steam's settings.

Nope. Phantom Pain is not out yet. The bonus in this game is a Phantom Pain's trailer only.
Yes
Yes but its just lime a preview to MGS5 Phantom pain .... This game will take you days to get 100% on its stealth game and yeah JTS one island you on there a lot to do .. Just.got to look for and be a fan of MGS
It is only a demo, it's not the full game
blu-ray disc, dude! :)
No. And for future reference, avoid trolling on this site, and actually ask some questions that need to be answered.
Reagone?
All xbox 360s are supposed to have a hard drive . Some Units require a slim hard drive or up to a 250 that snaps in place on the top of the xbox . You need to figure out which type you need . If its the older style 360 2nd hand drives are available cheap if you look . Make sure its a OEM hard drive not a fake from china. In the mean time you can maybe hook up a large thumb drive like 32gb or 64 and could play some games till you get the right drive . I would suggest the 250 GB cause the space goes fast and is used for other things like demos , videos etc. I hope this helps. Ash
yup
No apparently it won't for any format (one PS4 included) it won't - however; it will probably come Later as an extra included with some GOTY if the T.P.P. game goes there (?) - unless the ground Zero "demo" won't come at all , and it will turn into some expensive source of income for fans & collectors and speculator via e-bay and amazon sellers . The all point of it is that it was an overpriced game-play demo specifically made for the hype of T.P.P. and Kojioma (The king of the "Hideo cames") just showed that supporting him and his talent does not come for free. A bit like if Spielberg made us pay to see the trailer of his next movie. I conclude Video games industry even in Japan is rotten through the bones.
Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain is expected to come out early 2015, although some sources say the first release will be Dec 31, 2014. Phantom Pain will be released early 2015 for Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3 and PS4.
Yes. I have win 8 64 bit and it works fine.
Robert, that's an interesting question. I have always had Java installed in all my systems, and graphical things seemed to work better than not. I have never explored this game specifically to see if it plays better without Java, but it seems to play great with my existing profile. I don't experience the types and number of glitches that most forums are reporting. I hope this helps you.
I think the gold has all the dlc
Should be. I run it on Windows 8.1 with no problems, and 8.1 has more issues with gaming than 7 did in my experience.
that's typically an issue of your power supply either failing or not supplying adequate power.
As far as I know, you'd have to just replay the memory sequence through the progress tracker.
Yes because it will be stored into your steam account. If you do not have a steam account you need it to download the game

No, Pure1 connects with ONE device at a time. But you can switch between different devices. I alwasy switch between my cell phone and tablet. When driving, i connect it with my cell phone. At home, i connect it with my tablet.
If the PS3 has bluetooth function, it can. Just check the PS3 manual or bluetooth icon/logo on the device.
I d'ont know!!
Yes
No, only a small guide in hard copy.
yes
Through micro usb port on the headset
I believe it does. I actually bought it for my husband to use with his iphone but it should be compatible with any phone that has bluetooth capabilities.
very good
Yes, first you need to plug the bluetooth adapter and make your computer be bluetooth enable. Then you can connect this Pure1 headphone with your computer by Bluetooth tech.
Your character's levels, gear, vendors and stash are all saved together. When you transfer to PS4, all of that will be transfered.
Now confirmed for August 19th. http://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-3-ultimate-evil-edition-confirmed-for-both-xbox-one-and-ps4-coming-this-august/1100-6419572/
No
all the above
Yes you can
Transmog is making one piece of gear look like another. That way you can equip the stuff you need and if you don't like the way it looks, you can change it.
On the PC version, yes, you need to be online. On the console versions, you do not.
No
For all 4 versions, the Description states: This Ultimate Evil Edition contains both Diablo III and the Reaper of Souls expansion set, together in one definitive volume. There is other DLC available, but it is not required in order to play.
I believe that you and your online friends will need the same version of the game and the same console to play together. PS3 and PS4 players will not be able to play together.
Yes it does but they have an automatic timer on how long it can go unused like sitting it to the side to go to the bathroom or the kitchen for something it shuts the controller off but this is good because the battery time is amazing if you charge it right like I have but yes sixaxis is supported you bought a great controller
Yes
There is a small hole in the back ....have u tried to reset the control??
Yes, connects without problems . It's really easy
Hi there, The item you are referring to is a wireless Bluetooth controller. Hope that helps! Thank you, Rebecca SlickBlue
Hi there, This item is only compatible with a Sony PS3, it will not work with a MacBook. Thank you!
Yes it is useful. But you have to create a psn account from usa.
You could have gotten the option to get it online, this one actually comes to your house.
You wait for the card to arrive.
The expiration date is 1 year from the date you register.
Works on anything. They send the code I think in the mail and you redeem on the playstation store
No. Just works with us accounts! You need to create one!
It works just for one account...
I don't own as PlayStation 4 but the discount and the PlayStation Plus membership do work on one account. But any game that you would download for free via Playstation Plus, you can still play those games on a different account as long as they're on your PS of course.
they sent me an actual card

It was a PSP game that never got localized, but far as I know there are independent stories so we're free to buy this one without any problem.
I don't think this is kind of game that will have a ton of pre-orders, except for people that really have researched or know the game. It is one of those games that will probably be hard to find a physical copy after it's been released because it won't really be re-stocked. It'll be one of those games that about a month or two after it comes out, will probably have a jacked up price on Amazon , available on the e-shop and not on store shelves. But if you're planning to pre-order in say March/Early April it should be fine.
The pre-order bonus offer IS the Collector's Edition if I'm not wrong. It comes in a special box along with the sound track CD. http://www.siliconera.com/2013/12/17/conception-ii-collectors-edition-announced-nintendo-3ds-vita/
depends. it advises you can take as much time as you want. so you can go through as fast or as slow as possible and there is multiple endings so it does have a good replay ability.
If you type in Conception 2 Vita on Youtube there's 7 pages of videos of it.
I don't recall the demo offering that. If there is a lot of dialog then there is just going to be English. You can turn off voices anyway and just read the text.
Yes, it does
All 3ds games are region locked, so unless you have a north american 3ds, you won't be able to play it if you import it to europe.
The first print run is the collector's edition as is typical with Atlus games.
Yes, it is turn based. Turn order is affected by level and stats.
I am also in Japan, playing on a NA account, and it has been difficult trying to renew my subscription over here. Mogstation won't accept my Visa, presumably because it now recognizes it's not in the same country as the billing address. I can confirm that these cards do work for people in our situations - you'll enter it into the MogStation website. I've seen FF14 cards in the convenience stores over here - make sure you don't use these, because they won't work with a NA account. And for anyone else curious, there is surprisingly no extra lag or noticeable difference in gameplay when playing here. I've only noticed somewhat longer loading times.
60 consecutive days
yes it would. the lodestone ( ffxiv service page) will allow you to load service via a game time card to add service.
You use this game time card to renew your monthly subscription for 60 days
It's a game time card for the whole service. Doesn't matter what you play the game on. You could also go to the moghouse and pay for time there. The mog house is where you access your ffxiv account.
$12.99 for one character. As soon as you add another character, it goes up to $ 14.99/mo., but you can have up to 8 characters. This card operates the same way. It's $15/mo., because you can have up to 8 characters instead of just the 1 you with the $12.99/mo sub fee.
No just log into your square enix account and put the code on the card in at the mog station redeem code tab and that's it.
It's only adds game play time not Crysta
Yes, you can have the same account with the two platforms- time would be shared.
Time cards can be use to play ff14 online. The game requires a free to play. Use time cards instead of credit card

And for anyone else curious, there is surprisingly no extra lag or noticeable difference in gameplay when playing here. I've only noticed somewhat longer loading times.
60 consecutive days
yes it would. the lodestone ( ffxiv service page) will allow you to load service via a game time card to add service.
You use this game time card to renew your monthly subscription for 60 days
It's a game time card for the whole service. Doesn't matter what you play the game on. You could also go to the moghouse and pay for time there. The mog house is where you access your ffxiv account.
$12.99 for one character. As soon as you add another character, it goes up to $ 14.99/mo., but you can have up to 8 characters. This card operates the same way. It's $15/mo., because you can have up to 8 characters instead of just the 1 you with the $12.99/mo sub fee.
No just log into your square enix account and put the code on the card in at the mog station redeem code tab and that's it.
It's only adds game play time not Crysta
Yes, you can have the same account with the two platforms- time would be shared.
Time cards can be use to play ff14 online. The game requires a free to play. Use time cards instead of credit card
It does not come with one. There are special controller bundles that come with rechargeable packs. Otherwise you would need to buy a separate rechargeable battery pack for it.
The one I bought came factory sealed.
Yes, I'm using this with my Windows 8 rig and the wireless adapter/receiver, works flawlessly. There is little to zero lag between controller input and what happens on screen.
Yes, it works just as well as any other new genuine Xbox 360 controller and the blue chrome gives it a cool appearance.
All of the systemrequirements are listed on the game box.
Yes, it will run on Windows 8. To get Blitzkrieg 1 and its expansion packs running, all you have to do is go to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Blitzkrieg Anthology\". Then, go to the folder called "Blitzkrieg I", and then go to the "Run" folder. Then, look for the application known as "game.exe", and then right click on it. After that, go to the Compatibility tab and click on the check box for "Run this program in compatibility mode for:" and select "Windows XP (Service Pack 3)." Then, click on the check boxes for "Disable display scaling on high DPI settings" and "Run this program as an administrator." Then, go to the "Blitzkrieg I Burning Horizon - Rolling Thunder" folder, and go to the "Run" folder, and look for the "game.exe" application, and do the same thing. Now, Blitzkrieg 2 and its expansion packs may work without any changes, but just in case, go to the "Blitzkrieg 2" folder, and go to the "bin" folder. Then, right-click on "Game.exe," and go to the Compatibility tab. After that, click on the check boxes for click on the check box for "Run this program in compatibility mode for:" and select "Windows XP (Service Pack 3)." Then, click on the check box for "Run this program as an administrator." That's all. Thank you for your time.
No, online subscription isn't required or to my knowledge even available.
Yes. However it does hang on my 8.1 pc from time to time but they may be the video card overheating. I have a basic laptop. Not a gaming laptop
Only one dvd and it has 5 different games on it. It has 1 and 2 plus the expansions to them. Lots of hours and fun. I am glad that I bought this. Good luck to you.
Game wise.i didnt like the game at all..I play the game for 5 second and turn it off.more like a kids game..david.new Zealand.
I have this game, How would I know if Starforce is on the game.
I have Windows 7 Professional on my laptop. The processor is an Intel core 15 and the game runs but sometime it takes a while to being each new game. Not a computer expert here but hope this helps
As far as I can tell it seems to be English only. I checked the options section and there are no buttons to change language settings. Maybe the developer might have info I could not find. Hope this helps.
Yes they do, and they are good!
No but they're pretty cheap on Amazon
Well, unfortunately I'm not an avid gamer so I am not on it that often, but I have found that if you have it in sleep mode it does a very good job of retaining power. If I were to estimate, if you played it as much as the average owner, I would say you could get a guaranteed couple days out of it...I might even venture and say three days. Again thats just a guess. You might wanna poke around online and google some sites that will give you some good insight on the battery life. Hope I was able to help at least a little. Have fun and keep gaming! ;)
This 2DS comes with a grey wall charger, stylus, directions and a preloaded game. Basically everything you need to start playing right out of the box.
Yes it does. When you turn on the DS and scroll through the apps Pokemon X will appear.
I believe so.
Its plain Red... no Pokemon emblems. The game is just installed in the system memory
I didn't lose my preloaded data when I sent mine in for repairs.
The box says Windows 8.1 / 8 / 7 / vista / XP Pentium 4 or faster processor 2gb free disk space 1gb ram DVD optical drive Hope that helps.
I checked the back of the package and it states: Mac OS x 10.9, 10.8, 10.7, 10.6 2 GB free disk space, DVD optical drive. Hope this helps.
Installed with no problem or issues. Maybe the one you have is defective?
Yes you do. There should be an option on your Playstation menu specifically for redeeming codes under the Playstation store column. It's actually a lot easier than you'd think it would be, and these expansions are entirely worth it :)
I gifted to hubby. You will get an email with a set of codes for each expansion. I believe hubby went to play station store and had an option to redeem codes. You will get instructions on redeeming with your email. If you wanna package it cute, u can always write the codes down on a nice card :) I was too impatient lol just gave him the code off my phone.
If your original game is a US version, then you can just make a US account on your PS and download. If your original game was Indian, then it won't work. (Source: I bought it for use with Skyrim bought in the UAE. I could download via my US account, but not play)
The codes will be sent to your email.
Yes. I believe you can change the language in game.
Absolutely! Just be careful. One or more of the codes may require using the "space bar" rather than dashes (-). The bundle was well worth the price. Get used to being attacked by vampires, a lot.
Just the expansions, not the base game
You get codes ! I'd definitely go through amazon and get the codes.
Yes, but how much it changes the game depends on whether you play on PC or console. All a patch does on a console is fix glitches and bugs and such with the game itself. On PC it does the same but in a way that changes the game in a few ways; for instance there is a patch that fixes the infamous dragon stalking glitch, where dragon skeletons follow you throughout the map, by erasing the dragon skeleton itself as soon as you fast travel away from it. Patches for console don't work this way. If you are on console the only way to really change the game is through DLCs and modded saves, not patches in other words. The most a patch for console will change is how merchants act and erase the ability to take advantage of various glitches. That's about it.
Short answer: yes it should work without a problem. Longer version: You are essentially purchasing the digital version of the game, which wouldn't effect its playability. As long as you can access PSN you can get the game, you just put in the code under "redeem code/voucher" for the "free" download that you purchased here and it does it at no charge. Because of this it should not have any issues as far as countries its registered to. IF YOU DO HAVE ISSUES WITH COUNTRY: all you have to do to fix this issue is make a new profile on your Ps3 that has a US address and download it through that one, doing it this way will give you the game and allow you to access if on all profiles as long as the profile is on your ps3
I am pretty sure that it would be good for League of Legends. You can install the CD driver, and customize your buttons and also DPI.
For WoW, you'd want something like the perdition. I've found that mice, no matter the game, well last longer if you ease up on click pressure. It's all subjective though, I've had high end mice die in a few months and bagin bin ones last years. For the price, this mouse is great. Worst case, it doesn't work for you and you move to another.
i really didn't understand why they called it "power button", its just another button and as the other is full customizable at the 5 different profiles.. only one button is not customizable and is a little one located below the mouse and its a profile changer, so its perfect solution for changing from an specific game profile to another one.
Yeah, it's adjustable, using it at the moment it allows for you to fine tune the DPI to get it exactly to the level ya want it. So like, you have get 2,578 dpi if you wanted.
http://redragonzone.com/en/download.aspx then click on Mammoth Driver, hopefully it works. Or you can contact the company on the website and they might be able to send you something more specific. Hope this helps.
Just looking at it, it is the same. Same specs etc. I have to say this is a great mouse so far.
The left button click is semi-loud in a quiet environment. Nothing crazy though. The right button is quieter. On a 1-10 scale, 10 being VERY LOUD, id give this mouse a 6-7 overall.
yes, the profiles are saved on the hard drive.
3.25" wide, 5" long and 1.7" deep, it's really pretty big and would be great for fps cuz the side buttons are very easy to reach and really easy to change the DPI on the fly plus its programmable.
Yes, it works without any problem... Tested for 4 months
They are both excelent, the Redragon is just a bit too large for my hand.
I had the Razer Naga before buying this mouse, and the buttons are very easily reachable. There is a slight curve in the buttons, but does not hinder me. I am using the 1-9 buttons, my fingers are too short to reach the 10-12 unless I move my palm. If you have a larger hand/longer fingers, it should be no problem. Very good mouse!
Yes, the mouse does work with Vista, it's a fantastic mouse, it's the best mouse I've ever had in my opinion.
Absolutely, macro any keys you can press on the keyboard. it would be insecure though, clearly. open the utility, select the key, any key on the mouse is remappable, the drop down menu has nearly every option you can think of: left, middle, right click. forward/backward (up/down arrow really). single-key, combo-key (any two, e.g. ctrl-F1), cut/copy/paste/select all/find/new/print/save, switch window(alt-tab)/close window(alt-F4)/show desktop(windowskey-d)/lock pc, all media controls (play/pause/stop/volume-+/prev/next/mute/mute mic(clutch for voice chat servers), macros which can be any sequence of keys and delays of any length, fire key (which is mouse left click 3x fast, and loops if you hold it down for spamming), dpi cycle, dpi+, dpi-, profile switch, and even disable. you can make any button on the whole mouse into any of these commands. tldnr: yes, passwords and the kitchen sink possible.
I use an add on in wow for mine. It is meant for the razer Naga but works on the dragon to. I got the add on from the curse website. I can link to it this afternoon when I get home. Link for the Curse Addon is below: http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/razernaga Did you install the perdition software for the mouse? Mine worked in Wow before I used the add on but I had been playing with the software before that to.
Yes, you can program any of the buttons for that functionality. However, the top two buttons behind the scroll-wheel already function that way. The front one move forward, the back button moves you backward.
The red button can be programmed. It is like all the other buttons on the mouse, just red(maybe it is a common fire button spot)
No
the box says 18 months
Yes
Yes
Yes it can
Yes. It should just stick right on the glass. You just have to plug the USB plug into a USB port (I use one of the front ones on my Xbox 360) to power the LED. It will actually probably stick better on the glass CRT TV than on a flat screen because the glass should be a better surface for the suction cups.
A person aims and fires accurately when they aim down the sight. The device helps you fire better under the hip and helps you quick scope. And it helps a bit when aiming down the sight, when you gave an awkward gun sight.
It has a pull off tab on each suction and can be put on and off as many times as you want from tv to any screen you like. If the suction does not cling on as easy after taking it off clean it with a wet cloth and try again it again it more then likely has dust after cleaning it will stick again ..hope this answers your question.
If you're using a more porous screen, you may need to lick it first... age old suction cup trick.
Good question. Go to Youtube and search for COD Ghosts Hacks. You wont believe all the different hacks that are available and that are being used everyday. How about modded controllers ? Hundreds available thru Amazon. Nothing like shooting a bulldog shotgun with rapid fire. Seems to me that if you not cheating, then you are behind the curve. You are not playing on a level playing field anymore. I've played in a lot of matches, that if you ADS then shoot, your dead. Using the HipShotDot will help you get more kills from hipfire. Cheating, maybe, maybe not. Using the dot has helped me a little bit. I still like using the Variable Magnification Reflex sight for longer shots, but when your face to face with another player, put the red dot on him and fire. Spray and pray if you have to, kill or be killed. Remember that some of the best players having been drawing a red dot on a piece of tape and sticking it on their screen for years.
yes, dozens of hours used on my plasma with no issues, other than finger prints from finding that perfect center.
It's alot easier to see in the dark both for quick sighting and spraying with accuracy in a dark building or room. It gives you that extra edge if you need to even the odds alittle.
Absolutely. You need a USB connection to power the red led, but it doesn't matter what you connect it to in order to get that power. It works taking advantage of the basic physics of first person shooters - that the center of your screen is your aim point. It does not modify the game itself in any way.
It ends how the second movie ends --- ********SPOILER ALERT********* ********SPOILER ALERT********* ********SPOILER ALERT********* ********SPOILER ALERT********* They pour the gold on the dragon and then he leaves. Ends with Smaug flying off to Lake Town, and the dwarfs have the mountain. Cliff hanger I guess yeah. But expected. ********END SPOILER ALERT*********
Yes it does but its only two player and you have to share the screen the split screen does not effect the game play it takes alittle adjusting to but really fun to play with another player
There are checkpoints. We always save at a checkpoint; however, I am not sure they really save the level. The checkpoints are statues with a white circle in front of them. Have your child save there and then see if it does save the level. And be sure to quit and save when you end the game. Hope this helps.
Sorry I think this person received these for promotional purposes.

No, Wii U games will only work on the Wii U. The hardware inside the system is very different, so the publisher would need to create a separate Wii version. Unfortunately it looks like there will be very few new games available for the original Wii at this point.
Yes. Two player simultaneous is allowed, and FUN!!!
All
Hi, you have to press de + button on the second controller
Yes, you use the nunchucks. Unfortunately we have the same problem. It is the wires getting pulled and loose.
Yes, after you complete all the levels, you have "Free Play" where you roam around and complete other quests to get more characters.
Well usually hitting a button on the second controller should start the second player. At least that is what it was like on the ps3 version of Indiana Jones I had.
Sorry, I have no idea. Try contacting nintendo.com to find out.
It only covers the first two movies. The third is supposed to be released as downloadable content.
I do not believe Wii U games can be played on a Wii. The Wii U can play both but not the Wii.

Yes. 1080p Blu ray quality vs 760 for much crisper look but most importantly its the physics and lighting engines that are much better. I love both platforms but Tombraider shows u the future of games to come on PS4. U might play in 1080 on ps3 on your tv but its stepped up.
Yes that is normal.
PS4 games aren't region locked, but however their downloadable contents are , since this game is complete with everything included in it, you don't need to worry about that either. You can easily play it on your indian ps4.
To be honest, none of the new games ---like all of the PS4 games, have a booklet. They may include some little piece of paper but it never has any information about the game, usually just an ad for some other game or maybe an online code. If your game was used but didn't have anything in the case you aren't missing anything of importance. The manuals for the games are all online when you load the game, if you are signed onto the internet you will get an option to view the manual...hope that helps : )
I Bought it used but as far I can recall the outfits are in the disk so the tomb should be there too
I believe you can use the ps4 headset included with the system or any other compatible headset.
No, not on this version. However, there are many language packs, including Korean, available. There may be a localized version, or a pack available for download on PC.
You don't need internet access to play the single player story mode, but there are patches that have been pushed out that will greatly increase stability, fix bugs, and add additional features. These patches will require just hopping online briefly with the game.
Single player with an online multiplayer component.
Only English bro...
If you are speaking of Stereoscopic 3D, Farsight just released patches to all current tables as well.as DLC on the PS3 to add this feature and plans on adding this "coming soon" to the PS4 version as well. So to answer your question.... NO, but it will.
Yes
I would have thought they would have come with it but from what I could tell, they are nowhere. The disk I later realized was the same price as buying all the season 1 tables from PSN without any pro packs, so there really isn't any advantage to getting the disk over buying as a digital download
No, PS4 games are not compatible with PS3 systems.
Im sorry, Ive never heard of that game. If you like real pinball machine, current or retro, you will like this
No, it doesn't. Those are on the Zen Pinball 2 game.
pinball arcade is a great game! lots of tables and great graphics. I feel the flipper action could be a little tighter, ever though it's barely noticeable there is a slight lag
No
No it is PS4 only.
Hi joy sorry but there no online multiplayer mode but you can play up for people in the game and yes you can use 1 controller it's great game for the price you get 22 tables lots fun

being that it is fufilled by amazon, yes it ships to APO
Yes. It is cheap but functional.
There is an online store called the Xbox Live Marketplace. From there you can search for anything like games, movies, or music. After finding something you would like to purchase, you enter your credit card, or paypal, and purchase the item. After purchasing, your item will immediately start downloading onto our xbox 360. After your download has finished, you can see it in the "Recent" tile on the main dashboard.
matte
Yes it is
Yes you can purchase them from walmart I have also seen them at Amazon. I hope I helped.
Shrooms makes it loom like rainbows!
Haha you shouldn't. Microsoft released the white edition of the Xbox one with the sunset overdrive bundle releasing October 28th.
nothing, that's why the seller hasn't answered the question nor have they sold the system.
You are correct. The original white XBOX One was given to the employees whom helped develop the XBOX One. I am not sure about papers of authenticity but it should have a special code that allows you to download games for free. I do think its pretty resellerish and horrid they seperated the white controller from the package to only further financial gain. Normally employees must sign a statement that they will not resell the item. Honestly, I dont think its legal to sell these for profit.
500GB
What do you mean black case?
lol, no, it'll be just the console. You are better off waiting 2-3 months for the white one at the end of october.
It says it does not come with the white controller on the description lol. All the lies
Nope just the system.
It's probably 0000. I never needed to use a Pass Key but if it's asking for one I would thing that is it being that is usually the default number.
Definitely.. I have the same problem but it's easily adjustable because all music players come with the option of balancing between drivers. So just go to your music player's settings and tweak to suit
No. This is why I ordered them, and they would show a connection, but then had no audio.
It dos not work as Bluetooth device at all. Works as wired head phone. Even touch control does not respond for muting.
Yes I do.
As long as the device has blue tooth capability, it should link it without a problem.
yes, it can work with bluetooth version 4.0
Yes, you could hear the sound.The headphone can connect with the PS3
Yes, but you need to disconnect with the IP phone first, then connect with your smart phone via NFC. RaveTouch connects with ONE device at a time.
The blue light is directed downwards, and it is quite dim. It doesn't bother me, and I suppose it doesn't bother people around me.
You can listen to music or your videos basically for a whole day. The sound is pretty decent.
As long as the device you are using is compatible. Make sure that 3.5 mm jack on your PS4 controller is compatible with the RaveTouch input jack. This is very important; because the jacks on some PS4 controllers are smaller than the standard size used on most headsets and devices. If it matches, I highly recommend you get this headphone. What a sound! You will not be disappointed !
It works with PS3. Voice is clear. You just gotta have any other device's Bluetooth you synced it with off or else it won't sync with the PS3. The code yoi have to put to sync it is simply 0000. The headset gets uncomfortable after an hour of use tho, but maybe that's all headsets, and I got quite a big head lol.
Yes, It works great with both my tablet and computer.
Yeah
Yes
My guess is that they were both commissioned by the same factory by two different brands/companies. Common practice for a company to develop an idea/product and license it to other brands for marketing/distribution.
No idea... But when they worked, I loved them.... Then they didn't, after about 15 hours of use.
put your phone on can be recognized by device then when you hold the button for it to flash red and blue then hit Search and it should connect
I believe this is a knock off. It feels and looks like a real controller though. It has the same case as the real controller. Just the case has chinese letters. I've had the controller for 2 weeks now and I have had no problems. So for the price, I would get it.
It could if you customize it but I had a very hard time doing that. In the end I just gave up on this product.
yes i have played on 8.1 and i works great
It does. It works better on a Mac, actually. If you have any trouble with it, you can download a driver for it from the Xbox site. Shouldn't be a problem loading it though. Once you plug the controller into the USB port, let it load. All of the drivers should automatically download for you.
Yes, I've used it on a number of games on 8.1 with no problems.
no. it's a xbox 360 controller that can also be used as a gamepad for your computer.
No it's in English. There is English and Japanese voice overs though. It can be changed on the game options.
No it's the easiest one to get into.
Yes, there is tutorials for newcomers and I suggest you read it careful too plus don't speed through it.
No, I'm afraid not. It comes with English or Japanese audio tracks and English subtitles only.

The Problem for you and Others,is Amazon should have put or shown the back of the Box as well ,to answer; yes and no,let me explain; Quoted from the box; then it will answer almost any question; From the box; Tomb of the Lost Adventurer , 6 outfits for Lara ( nothing sexy ) kind of ugly(my opinion) ,8 Multiplayer Maps, 6 Multiplayer weapons ( that is what you asked specifically) 4 Multiplayer characters . so once you have certain levels in multiplayer you can attain these ,need be,play on single person or private .BUT; note the downloads are not in the disc you must REDEEM 8 long codes to, get these items ,you start with nothing and work your way up .(Spoilers Ahead) the weapon or pistol is simply that in single player and you must find parts or earn them as you level up in the game ,different areas,etc.. If you have the game and like it then ,i wouldn't even get this,the only reason i did ,i have been collecting Tomb Raider or Lara Croft items Many years,this kind of ticked me off when they could have included these items on the disc for a G.O.T.Y. ,all companies are lazy and stingy now..hope i helped some..Later....
my personal choice is the regular one
I just checked and unfortunately it does not have Portuguese voice, but it does have Portuguese subtitles.
It is long codes for each DLC
I believe it is, I don't know anything about the definitive edition I think the definitive edition is Xbone exclusive, while the GotY ediotion is for 360.
Ya I'm pretty sure it does just remember if u buy this make sure it's for someone with little ears lol
Yes it is, I have both a PS3 and PS4 and it works perfectly with them. With the 3 you must attach the adaptor cable though but with the 4 you can plug it straight into the controller. Hope this helps!
I haven't used the play stations gold so I can't really say. But I can say that the Tritton Kunai sounds really good for the buck.
Hello, You can use the Inline cable as long as your TV has an audio output section on it which is attached to the inline. The PS4 itself does not have these connections so as long as you can connect to a RCA output via your TV you will be able to use the inline.
Yes it does!
No
Yes, you can.
It can extend, but big ears no
Not unless your partners have the TV up where your voice comes through the TV and back through the mic. The Mic is really good.
I want to say 4 to 5 inches. Its plenty long enough to reach the front of your mouth

None of these editions are compatible with MacOS X, this game requires Windows. See the system requirements.
Yes
Nothing to do offline :(
You log into your Origin account and begin downloading after the purchase. No entering codes or waiting for an email.
You put the code into Origin. Doesn't work for xbox.
They give you a code to immediately redeem on Origin. Then you can download and play.
I can't imagine why not, but you should probably direct this to Origin just to be sure.
it is possible you get a code and input the code in origin, whomever puts in the code first gets the game so you could buy an instant access code and then give it away.

I can't imagine why not, but you should probably direct this to Origin just to be sure.
it is possible you get a code and input the code in origin, whomever puts in the code first gets the game so you could buy an instant access code and then give it away.

These use the same drivers as the ad700 which was rated #1 in audio positioning in the world by hundreds of pro players and audio enthusiasts.
Ps4 compatible and I use it on my xbox one. I bought some triton headphones and I use the adapter that came with the tritons. Very nice. Scary awesome with advanced warfare.
It works perfectly fine without the extension cable. I have tried it using FaceTime and cellphone calls. Audio and voice come through clearly on my end and the other end.
No, it's not detachable.
My friends haven't noticed anything during gaming sessions. There was this one time I had extremely loud volume when my friend was able to hear himself, but that wasn't a comfortable volume level anyways. Note that I don't even have any echoing or noise cancellation activated, so it's probably not going to be any problem.
If you're using them for gaming. I would say yes, the mic quality is very good in this headset. The highs and lows are also supreme for knowing where the enemy is or just the ambiance
Thank you for your interest. These headsets are very different. The sennheiser is closed back and therefore will offer deeper bass response while the athadg1 is open back for better mid and high tones. Also, I have used the athadg1 headset and would argue that it is one of if not the most comfortable headsets currently available. Hope this helped.
Mine were
They are pretty similar but I want to say that having all the AD700 (not ad700x) and the adg1, a700, and ag1, I will say that the adg1 is great for gaming/smartphone but I feel they aren't as "open" as the ad700. I'm told they are a lot more like the ad700x which is a slightly different design but the frequency response is the same. Oh and the extension/splitter cord broke on mine after dropping the headset while it was plugged in. I can probably fix it but I just used the little sub soundcard/amp that came with it. It works really quite well!
I got no complaints about my keyboard clicks. I have mechenical keyboard from razor it's a black widow
No, it's not included. You should buy it separately.
Yep. Same size with different theme color.

yes.
No, the angel wings come in the first CE. This one has no exclusive in game contents... Sad.
Its the fisical
If you mean by DLC the hearthstone codes yes, for the other things no, since when you register the game it registers as the CE and it gives you automatically the other things
Yes. The collectors edition in-game items are only cosmetic.
I use a finger tip grip on my mouse and feels very good, i think its pretty good for palm grips also infographic about the different types of grips: http://i1.squidoocdn.com/resize/squidoo_images/400/draft_lens20671124module166214746photo_1361298718a____a_.png
The mouse wheel is very smooth and you can definitely feel it when you scroll.
The colors are locked to the 4 presets as far as I can tell, but you can change the sensitivity of each preset. Usually the most sensitive preset is this weird pink color, but I changed it so that the green color was the most sensitive because I like it more.
This mouse is great for gaming. The 2 thumb buttons can easily be mapped to game functions. (I haven't tried it with LoL, but I used to be a big LoL player.) The mouse looks pretty cool too :)
Likely yes. However, you will give up convenient color/speed/button setting features.
Was a tad bit wonky on first use. After I installed the driver/config software it work okay. What OS are you using? I am not sure if it is completely Win 8/8.1 compatible.
I think that is the weights in the mouse
Nope! Sony products (unless specified) are region free.
PCH-1001 - OLED Screen, no 3G
No they are not swapped on the Vita. Standard PlayStation button layout, the same as the DualShock 1/2/3/4
Yes it does it comes with everything a brand new one would
The only size adjustment I have found is by making the starting screen go to full screen. I have not found a way to size the screen to a desired partial size or a way to control the size of the cards.
Yes, I think so. I just downloaded it onto 8.1, and it is running fine.
None. but, I've started enjoying Scorpion a lot. Although it takes a while to get the knack of it, it is actually fun!
My all-in-one game is not at online game. But, I have seen before that you can see others scores. Good luck with yours...! :)
Dear Margie, You have to uninstall old version of the game manually, then you will be able to update the game without any problems. Thank you!
Dear Margie, You have to uninstall old version of the game manually, then you will be able to update the game without any problems. Thank you!
you can only undo your last move. It has 13 games. It has hint.
No it is not. I found the All-in-One Solitaire really disappointing. I deleted it from my computer.
I did download it after some trouble. The game was awful and Norton said it may have a virus. I deleted it from my computer. Just glad it was as cheap as it was.
I like the games sometimes, too, but sometimes I don't. My favorite is Triple Free Cell, but it takes sort of a long time to play, and a good bit of patience. Once in a while, when I have finally reached the point so I will win, one of the cards just takes off on its own, drifts right off the page! And the whole thing freezes. Nothing more you can do. Frustrating.

Light stays on when the ps4 is on standby and on mode, only turns off is ps4 is off or if you unplug the usb.
No I never have overheating issues..heat dissipates up so a vent on the bottom wouldn't matter
You should just return, lights should turn on when your ps4 is ON and connected to the USB port.
No I don't think so. But there is an inter cooler accessory similar to this one with extra USB ports just without the led lifhts
11.5"
I bought the limited edition for $35 and it didn't really come with anything cool. So just stick with the standard because I just checked the price for the limited and Its not worth it.
Imo I think it's better than the first. In this one, the graphics are gorgeous and every facial animation is incredible; I found myself deeply immersed during the cut scenes. Also, the game play is phenomenal; and as you progress in the story they give you new powers; each very unique and different than the last; with each new power you get a whole new atomic bomb for it! They also give you the choice to switch between the different powers when ever you want! The only con about the game, imo, is the minor differences between the good/evil power sets; they are pretty much the same, but the different powers you get makes up for it. Overall I give this game a 9; and I recommend it to all ps4 players! Happy gaming!
Just English
No multiplayer. Just single player campaign.
No
yes
This means that you can play the game everywhere across the world. Like if you live in Europe, Africa, Asia and America the disc works in all of them.
If you're buying used, the limited edition will most likely be useless as any DLC codes will have been redeemed already. If there is no price difference, I would say get the limited edition for the heck of it. As far as the actual game goes though, there is no difference that I'm aware of.
Yes
Yes , i saw it on settings
Yes it absolutely will. Elite Dangerous has a specific setting for the x-55 stick under control settings. Also all of the buttons on the x-55 stick can be easily re-configured any way you want them. So any button can become whatever you want that button to be. Hope that makes sense.
Yes it does. However, unlike the X52 series, there is no pin on the stick to prevent the twist action. I hear one has to disable this in the driver settings if one has special foot peddles for the rudder.
Considering aircraft in real life are not built with "left-handed" configurations, I very much doubt it. Left-handed pilots in the modern-day Air Force simply learn to fly the standard configuration.
I really can't give a specific answer for the X 55. but I have the X 52 Pro and am well pleased with the sensitivity. Also you can get a paid version of the FS4UIPC and that opens up a lot of options in FSX for all controllers. Sorry I cant be more specific, but if it is as good as the X 52 Pro, and has dual throttle functions, may be worth the price difference. Also the X 55 requires 2 free usb ports while the X 52 requires only one. The x 52 Stick connects to the throttle and the throttle connects to usb.
Both bases are the same, in inches, Length:(front to back) 8 3/4 in, Width: 7 1/4 in, Height: 2
The trigger is single stage.
Uh... Amazon does. Just add it to your cart and check. You'll have to pay the import taxes upfront. Those are MORE expensive than the unit... But it'll get sent straight to your house. No fuss. I just tried with my address (I'm from Rio de Janeiro), and the total was about US$ 443.00. Still... This seems to be in pre-order? 1-3 months to ship... The Saitek site has as of today (Aug 28) pre-order buttons. Maybe they're out of stock?
no & no
The X52's stick was way to loose for me for precision corrections. It also had a dead zone that I just didn't like. X-55 is much, much better.
Yes, you can change the colors from blue, red, green, amber on throttle and joystick.
If you attach the controller to the charging cable wires... yes but if you have a ps4 charging dock it will not work with grips on.
I guess it can, if you have enough friction. They fit not perfect, but pretty good. For me it did not affect the analog sticks. The face buttons might take a while to get use to. Cause now when u push on them they don't seem to move much. Cause the thickness of the skin. I hope that helps.
Definetely no need for removal
We Are Ships From China,shipping by USPS with tracking number from China 7-14 business days delivery.
It doesnt effect mine at all, u know when u have no skin on it an u move it up an down it makes like a crack or a snap noise u may not hear that but it doesnt make a difference with the mobility but if u do have a problem u jus may need to adjust the skin on the controller jus by pushing down under the analog when the skin is on an u should have no problems...
the game is included in the box
Our store will ship out in 24 hours if you purchase from us.
No, this PS3 cannot play PS2 games. The PS3 model that allows PS2 back-play essentially has a PS2 inside that allows the back-ward compatibility, making that model MUCH heavier. PSone playback however is possible. Of course, PS2 games that have been brought into the PSN for digital download for the PS3 can play on here.
Not terribly heavy. Probably weighs as much as my 15" laptop. Hope this helps.
I bought it for my son so who lives out of state so I don't know. If you live in America call gamestop or look one up online and call and ask them and they will probably be more able to answer your questions. The reason I bought the PS3 instead of the ps4 is because you can still get online free with PS3, they are still making games for PS3 and lastly I read online the ps4 has been having a lot of issues and the PS3 have been around a lot longer and for the most part have already fixed their glitches. Good luck bro and I do recommend this product coming from a happy dad who son loves it :-).
yes
No it DOES NOT work with the ps3 console. However there are a lot of blue tooth headsets that are great
Given the proper tool, yes, it can be used as a PC Headset. http://www.amazon.com/Smartphone-Headset-PC-Adapter-01-PH35-PC35/dp/B008OB2NHA/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1425980284&sr=1-1&keywords=3.5mm+headset+to+pc+adapter &lt;- With that, you can plug it into both plugs of a PC and use it as a headset.
yes theoretically that should work just fine but if u buy it and it doesn't i am sure amazon would give you a refund
No just ps4 ps vita and also works with xbox1
The cord can be plugged into your controller. So, yes, there's a cord. But, no, it shouldn't be going across your floor because it goes from your headphones straight to your controller; not the PS4 unit.
The gold edition wireless and I have them now they are more then worth the money
The options should be "Chat Only", which only sends the chat talk, or "All" which sends chat plus all game sounds.
Not unless youre testing the mic

May 6th 2014 in the US
As far as I understand it they've 86'd the 3G feature. WiFi only for the new slim model.
Yes actually they have switched for the slim to the standard micro usb charge port! WooHoo!
It's cheaper because most of the prices you see over $200 are for people selling them above the MSRP. The price for both the 3G and Wifi models of the original Vita dropped to $200 a few months ago, but quickly sold out from most places that sell for the typical MSRP; everyone started marking up the price to better match demand.
two players Co-op
There is an ign unboxing video. http://www.ign.com/videos/2014/04/29/ps-vita-borderlands-2-bundle-unboxing-video Basically: - USB charger + adapter - PS Vita Slim - Borderlands 2 voucher
Got my e-mail yesterday saying it will be delivered on the 8th so it looks like we have to wait. Not too happy about that.
Yes
No the ps vita is not region locked. Japanese games should work fine
My hope is that Amazon is being cautious and giving themselves a buffer now. So that when you possibly get it on the 7th you'll be pleasantly surprised. That being said it sounds like Amazon got their shipments in late so that instead of having them day(s) before release so you get it on release day...now they are all after the date. That's what is sounded like when I talked to customer service. Very apologetic but not much they can do. I have 1 day shipping and it's the 8th for me too. I also confirmed that they did NOT oversell the preorders. That was my fear.
I doubt it. The back bracket wouldn't stay in place or support the weight. I ordered a different one that cost a little more and am quite satisfied. They were quite good about arranging the return and refund. I bought a PDP Kinect TV Mount.
I would say you need about 3" from the back side of the tv to the wall. That should do it.
No they are two different set-ups, one won't work for the other
It should work as my son's TV is an older LCD (at least 3-4 years old) also; I never measured it exactly but he had no trouble attaching. I know for sure it's not one of those very slim edges that are on the market today. Should work fine.
I'd be surprised if it did. I bought this for my flat 42" LG and it wouldn't lock tight up top and sat flimsily on top of my television. Spend the extra few bucks for the PDP mount.
Yes it snaps on to it
Yes it does.
I own a zero edge TV and you can't even notice it.
I would say yes as long as the tv is facing at a downward angle with at least 3 inches or more space between wall and mount if that makes any sense. Hope that helps if flat it will either fit or won't. Sorry if it doesn't as my tv is not on my wall.
I bought $1.99 Velcro 2 way tape works great, You can put it any were on the tv
I recently bought one of these controllers and they work great. I have never owned an actual SCUF so I can't compare, but the paddles do not seem hard to press at all. The only problem I had with mine was that it was difficult to plug the microphone in to the controller because the motherboard inside was slightly off. I contacted the seller and he walked me through how to deal with the issue. It works fine now. Hope this helps.
yes they will
No. It doesn't.
If you want the default joysticks of the Xbox One, please message me and I will make sure to get you one without the dome joystick.
I have no clue they never respond to service requests
Your T.V. probably doesn't blend the VGA with your audio input. What you need is a 3.5 audio jack to a female RCA jack. This should 100% fix your problem.
No, it doesn't look yellowish in my HDTV using this VGA cable. I would double check the color settings on your HDTV first to make sure your cabel is not defective.
This is most likely due to the monitor not supporting the native Dreamcast resolution of 640x480. Try an alternate display device. The cable is a pass through style cable, that simply takes the signal from the dreamcast (which outputs VGA for supported games) and passes it to the VGA monitor. Some newer tv's and flat panel monitors don't properly support 640x480.
You get an RCA adapter that allows you to connect the red and white cable and convert them into a standard headphone output.
Not your PC but your monitor.
The cable didn't work on my TV. On a computer monitor it looked amazing. Only way I can see it working is with a VGA to HDMI adapter, but you have to dish out some extra bucks. The cheap ones do not work. I tried two and the colors had a yellow hue. Test the cable first on a monitor, if its clear it works. If its still bad its possible you may have a defect.
Yes
6ft
As I understand it, light guns require A) a CRT, and B) a certain refresh rate that modern HDTVs (CRT or otherwise) don't support. I'm sure someone will be able to give you a more detailed answer, but I would think that the only way it might work is using an older non-HDTV CRT display. And to answer your question more directly - no, I haven't tried it. :)
Not all Dreamcast games are VGA compatible. There are workarounds for some of those that aren't, bit you would have to search for that online. Most games will work even if not advertised though. If it is not working on any games, you may want to check your setup or see about returning it. Mine works with almost any game.
I thought you only needed it for ps4 to go from the controller to the headset for voice chat I didn't think you need it for ps3 I could be wrong tho
I have the xp400s and it works fine for me, if you headset has the 2.5mm plug on it and your controller/ adapter has the 3.5mm plug, then yes, it will work. I have an Xbox One and the chat headset adapter
There is no in-line volume control on this audio cable. The game volume is controlled by headset (depending on the headset) while chat volume is controlled via the headset options on the PS4.
http://support.turtlebeach.com/kb_upload/image/headsets/PS4%20setup%20diagrams/X12_PS4_Setup_Diagram.png
This cable is designed to connect a compatible headset to a PS4 controller for mic/chat functionality. It is not designed-for or supported-on Mac systems.
I don't think it will work for the Xbox 360 because the plugin on the controller side is different. Which is why I purchased this cable to use with my ps4.
Not sure. We had actual turtle beach earphones and it didn't work. Ended up just getting the Sony headset instead of returning the cord...
Umm.. Not quite sure what you mean. In my set up, this cord connects to my controller and headsets mic output. It's the part that allows others to hear me in chat. Everything I use is corded though. If you can transmit your voice in chat with out a cord connected to your controllers mic input, this cord isn't needed.
Yes
the battery life is very good, the duration is 7 hours or more. I charge every 2 days.
https://support.us.playstation.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5244/kw/headset Frequently Asked Questions Question: How many Gold Headsets can I use with my PlayStation system? Answer: On the PS4 system, you can use up to two Gold Headsets at a time. On the PS3 system, you can use one PlayStation headset at a time.
Hi, yes you CAN use this via 3.5mm jack (the cable is included). Sound quality stays the same when the battary is charged but if your battary is dead and you are using it with the cable plugged into PS4 controller the sound quality will be lower but I repeat ONLY if the battary is dead, if it is NOT, it will work like a pro either wired or wirelessly. Hope this helps. I sometimes forget I have them on, that's how unbelievably comfortable they are. I think the sound is comming from my sound system and have to actually feel my head to make sure they are on (I think that only happens when the volume is lowered) with the volume high you wount have this problem.
No my gf sleeps right next to me wile I play all my games, this headset does not leak at all from my gf standpoint and I have it very loud sometimes.
You can adjust the volume and chat sound to make each loader or quieter, or turn off each all together.
you can buy an astro gaming mix amp for that.
I've tried it on both the PS3 and PS4 with Frozen, which has 7.1 sound track. And it does seem to handle the surround sound well enough that you can definitely discern ambient sounds, directionality of movement and effects, and separation of musical instruments from each other. It's not the GREATEST surround sound headset, but I can still enjoy the movie using them. FYI, I use this for my XBone as well.
Yes, it does work for xbox one with the Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter
Yes you can..it works also on other devices such as music players and mobile phones by using the 3.5 mm cable...its included in the package
My son and I both wear glasses and have no problems with them.

Yes, full support for anything above Ubuntu 12.04
it may be seperate but it is possible to get the to together for a good price.
The Leap Motion can be used as a mouse but requires complex handling and clicking is very tricky sometimes,...I wouldn't count on it...
As long as the cable reaches the computer tower its ok.
it can be around 10 inches away side to side but not back and fourth
This product is will not replace your mouse. You can use it to perform similar things as a mouse, but it's so horrible at it that you'll go back to your mouse as your primary way of interacting with your computer. My "Leap Motion" device is so not useful, that its just been sitting on my desk under a stack of paper for months. Can't find a real, everyday use for this device other than to just play around with it's apps.
There are apps that will allow you to program actions for your personal use, such as programming a swipe as skipping a slide in powerpoint, but this can be complex, though there may be apps that assist you in this already...
I got 2 cables, one was a very short one, perhaps 15-20 cm, while the other one i got was longer, around half a meter maybe...
if you want motion controlling for gaming i think you've only got the razer hydra for now.
Hello Kumarswamy, Thank you for the query! The Leap Motion Controller is compatible with the Oculus Rift with the latest release of our V2 SDK.

All 3DS games work on the 2DS. So yes, this one does work.
I am pretty sure it won't work on an Australian 3ds console :(
I think you need to set your DS settings to Spanish, the games that have the language will automatically appear in Spanish then.
I do not recall seeing the language option, Jose. I think it may be in English only.
You need to be able to read
It is for any gender. You can make your character either a boy or a girl
A child who couldn't read would be frustrated by this game. 99% of the game is not voice-acted, so they wouldn't understand what was going on. There's a note on the back of the box as well that says reading ability is required to play, which is completely true. The ability to read character dialogue and game menus is absolutely necessary.
It will not work on a regular Nintendo DS or Nintendo DS XL, it only works on Nintendo 3DS, 3DS XL, or the Nintendo 2DS systems.
AR cards come with the system when you buy it. Sometimes,but rarely will games come with AR Cards. ( When I say rarely I mean RARELY)
No it definitely will not. I hope it will be released for the uk market soon as I bought it for my son and he cannot play it on his machine.

Yes it does require an internet connection and the Steam application installed to be able to play the game, even straight out of the box with the CD key. I hope this answer helps you, I did not know that before purchasing and I am unable to play because I do not have an internet connection where I am at this time. Once you are able to get online and activate it with Steam though, apparently you have to set STEAM to offline play (while being online) then afterwards, internet is not required - just activation.
Yes that is what complete edition means
alright the answer to your question is yes. You need access to steam however but you dont need to be connected to the internet. simply open steam in offline mode and go from there. Usually my steam account opens as soon as i log on to my computer then gives me a choice to connect to the internet or continue and open steam in offline mode. Open it in Offline and you can play Civ 5 offline. hope this makes sense
You can play offline it just won't be connected to Steam, and a msg will pop up that says Steam won't be able to sync your game files from the cloud. That's the best answer I have from our little experiment we just did by turning off our internet and seeing if our son could still play and he could....Hope it helps!
It comes with a cd that you can load the game off of. According to the booklet you don't have to download it via the cd and can just activate it from steam, but I don't have any experience with that so I'm not sure how that would work out for you.
hi, how i can buy the disc ? i already bought it by download from steam and until now i can not play the game. i asked many questions and tried many ideas to solve my problem but nothing help and steam support not care at all. i just know today how to buy from amazon and send it to my city, so no more steam :)) by disc very easy and better and if have games here reguire to steam i will not buy it
Yes
This version of the game has a Simple physical manual&#65288;7 page), a page of TECH TREE AND SPECIFIC CHARTS. It has 15 DLC. It need a account of steam. The game program can download in steam, DVD disk can't need. These help to you? if not, Please ask me in simple English again, my English is poor.
To receive all of the DLC (Brave New World and others) you'll need to activate the CD key through Steam where you will be able to download the game and all of its components. Keep in mind that you will need an account with Steam and have the Steam Client installed.
I am forced to keep the disk in the drive. There may be a way to play without the disk, but I'm not aware of it.
Have the same question. Even Best Buy has them on the store shelves for 69.99 each. And the combo should be significantly less since it probably only has 1 transceiver, and 1 extender cable.
Yes, there are two cables. one is a Unifying receiver extender in case your keyboard and mouse are our of range or your signal is bad because of interference, it is a USB male to female. The other cable is the one you want it is a USB male to Micro male charging cable. To charge the mouse you insert the cable on a SLIGHT angle, it does not go straight in. When you are looking at the mouse the charging cable will be slightly up. Once you do it the first time you will get a feel for it.
I just went to my neighbors to type this sentence, 3 walls and 30 feet away,worked fine. It started breaking up at 4 walls and 40 feet away. It is not bluetoothe. It is the standard 2.4 ghz. and works 10 times better than any bluetoothe. I have had absolutely no problems with the unifying adapter. I have accumulated 2 marathon mice, and this keyboard mouse set. The unifying reciever's all work great and brain dead easy to pair up. Love the quite keyboard and smooth feeling keys. I am spoiled with this set. I'm sure it will work with your dell or any computer.
Yes, but you will need a logitech unifying receiver (available for under 10 bucks). Logitech is competing with Bluetooth and making there own receivers going away from the universal Bluetooth. On the universal receiver plus side you may have up to 6 devices synchronized. I keep two pointing devices per computer so this works for me. Logitech also claims their own receiver will eliminate the double click problem that occurs with some mice as they get older; but that remains to be seen. If you do not want to buy another receiver you make take the one from home but that defeats the convenience end so just get another receiver. Good Luck.
I am sure it will void the warranty.
that is 1 charging cable do 1 at a time
My keyboard is relatively close to my computer and I have no latency.
With moderate to heavy use, I get at least 5 or 6 days out of the mouse before I recharge it. The keyboard will go two weeks or more. Both would surely last much longer if I turned them off when I'm not using them; but I don't. Recharging takes about 20 minutes using the supplied usb cable.
Yes.
There are two tabs that flip down to raise the keyboard. But there's only those two angles. Normal height and with the tabs down. Hope that helps
Yes, mine worked just fine!
It's black label.
Yes.
The prepare to die edition contain the additional content not included with the original release and has an easier system of leveling and player vs player online battles due to enemies dropping more souls. Prepare to die is more than worth the extra dollars. Good day
Yes
Not anymore. Free to play after purchase.
you can use the code on the ESO website or steam the game requires 75 gb free space on HDD to unpack and install and my game takes up 41.6 gb total when finished
Buy it from Steam or buy it separately, it works the same.
No, it doesn't. You have to buy the code online or find an edition that still has it included.
yes, you can there are two "mega servers" available for play..one in the USA and one in Europe you are able to pick which "mega server" you would like to play on from the "settings" section on the UI btw I play with folks from Germany on the USA server, and some USA players use the mega server in Europe you can only use one at a time however
steam.
There's programs u can get that will allow u to assign commands to controllers yes
Yes, in either 32 or 64 bit versions.
I purchased early before game was out and 30 free days were included. I do not know if they are still giving 30 days free now?
It's similar to other MMO style games. The game is designed for players who like to explore and quest along the lines of Skyrim. Instead of kill 10 bandits or collect 10 plants objectives the game has you in the role hero wandering around saving individuals, towns, cities and kings. The game is different from other MMO's in that all skills are available. All professions, weapons, armor and skill trees with enough skill points available (a lot of work) to fill them all out on one character. PvP is similar to GW2's eternal battleground open WvWvW with the 3 factions fighting over lots of objectives. ESO's open world PvP is huge, much larger than GW2 even with all 4 zones added together. A lot more fun than GW2 to me, controlling certain scrolls gives PVE bonuses to the whole faction. Fully leveling a character through questing takes you to all 5 zones in all three factions. That's a lot of questing so I can see why players who don't like to quest or enjoy story lines would get bored with the game.

You can gift the code. Or give the game through Steam.
Yes. I have a gaming desktop and a laptop, both with Windows 8.1, and Civ 5 runs just fine although I definitely have to play the game at low settings across the board on my laptop. (Intel Core i5 Ivy Bridge, Intel HD Graphics 4400) Looking at the hardware on the Surface Pro 2, it looks like you'll be able to run the game but expect low framerates if you're playing at 1920x1080. I've also noticed better performance running the game in DirectX 9 mode on my laptop as opposed to DirectX 11 so you may want to go that route as well.
Steam is awesomeness. You sign up for free and if you digital download your game it keeps track of all your games for you. Games take up a lot of memory so you only need to download the games your currently playing. Steam stores the games in the cloud on their servers and you will own the rights to all the games you purchase if your hard drive crashes computer gets stolen doesn't matter not all is lost just sign up new computer and re download games.It's awesome because a steam game has all the software patches and a whole global community that supports and even MODS the games. You can also trade games and gift games you purchase just like you could a hard copy of a game also steam games go on sale all the time your missing out on affordable new games You don't know PC gaming until you join Steam.
Gill, It appears to install the expansion packs you don't have. The game I had in progress continued from where I had left off, although it was obvious from the opening screenshots that new content had been added overall. Hope this helps.
You can play it on Mac since it has SteamPlay as stated at http://store.steampowered.com/app/8930/.
No you have to have steam
Does your laptop have a graphics gard? I suspect you may need dedicated graphics for this one. It runs great on my 2012 laptop; but, I have a Geforce 600 series graphics card installed. If in doubt, you might try www.systemrequirementslab.com, which may be able to give you a preliminary answer.

This game will not work on the regular DS. It will only play on the 3DS or 2DS. (The 2 DS is the flat version that does not have a hinge.)
I believe the only multiplayer is in fighters.
Let me answer this carefully. You can play up to four people with ONE cartridge within the Kirby Figthers mode. The other three systems must use the download play feature on their systems but it works and only one cartridge is needed. Each person must have their own system and be in the same room with the one who has the cart in theirs. There is no adventure mode multiplayer so they cannot follow the adventure storyline within the game. Does that help?
You can have it in both English & Japanese.
I would say yes. The normal Kirby controls are very basic. You have movement with the analog stick or D-Pad with pressing Up causing Kirby to suck in air and start to fly. A jump button, a "suck" button to draw in the enemies which you can then press Down to gain their powers. That's where the game gets interesting and definitely more complicated. Once an ability has been absorbed the controls change. Your buttons change based on the ability which adds some spice to the game. What's more, if you're getting confused about the controls you can always check the bottom screen for information about how your abilities work.
This game has a campaign/story mode like Nightmare in Dreamland.
Yes
Yes
This game may be a bit tame for a 19 year old at first. It does unlock some extra challenges near the end for more advanced players, but this would be best for either younger children or teens, or older players with nostalgia for the original Kirby games for NES and SNES. The main game itself can be beaten in about 8-10 hours give or take.

Yeah, the US release does not have a manual, shame I know, but the game itself shows you detailed instructions for modes and options anyways.
It will, but not all at once. From the EU version, it seems like Campaign Pack 1 (with Shigechi and Kira) is already out, while Campaign Pack 2 will be out May 14, most likely including Fugo and Iggy. It seems like they're going the same route as the JP version did by releasing DLC with their respective campaigns every 2-3 weeks.
I haven't seen anything on the game that says it's in spanish. I've only noticed it being japanese voice with english subs with no options to change it in the settings menu.
The Amazon pre-order unfortunately only gives you Shigechi. In order to have gotten Kira DLC you would have had to prs-order from namco bandais website.
Yes, unfortunately a lot of modern games nowadays are trying to push to digital downloads because it is cheaper, that is why there is such a limited copy of ASB, and also why the game has the safety information printed on the cover.
Amazon e-mailed me the code about a day or two before release date. I pre-ordered the game around March. If you ordered from Amazon, check your spam folder or old e-mail.
Well, it looks like it, I liked the JP cover too, and I though it was gonna be like that, but nope. It looks good to me though anyways. (Would be nice if they have reverse cover art or something.) &gt;_&gt;
Its mandatory and about/around 2GB.
Well, from what I read, Bamco mentioned that they already fixed the issue with the DLC codes and the Campaign stuff not working. And yes, its still there on the PSN store for this game if you mean looking for the campaign data.
Licensing issues most likely thats the problem the series
Yes, I wear glasses/have worn glasses my entire life and the headset is more comfortable than any other headphones/headset I've had.
Hi, Yes work this Gaming Headset Sentey with Skype , not problem at all
Hi , it support Real 5.1 Surround sound because comes with 6 real drivers, 3 drivers each side, including subwoofer. The virtual surround is created by software and not by the speakers/drivers , in this Headset not need any software to got surround because has a 6 physical drivers , 3 in each side/ear.....
Hi , No it is only for PC, works in all the functions only with computers
Oh yes. The case is very roomy.
Yes the Sentey headset works with either of them
Yes, it comes with two sets. A leatherette and foam set.
I hoped for it to work with my xbox as well pc. But when I plug in the headset to the xbox360 my xbox fails and freezes as I think it just cant handle it as its taking to much battery or something or could be the software etc. But I have one of the first xboxs so it might just be the originals and maybe an xbox elite could handle it but mine cant.
Hi works in mac but not the software
Hi.! Harmoniq Pro is top of the level because them comes with 6 real drivers , 3 on each ear, so the 5.1 is this headset is real with 5 real drivers + 1 subwoofer real, not virtual by software, in the Symph and Vibros the 7.1 are Virtual not real, is it made by software, the sound quality in the Harmoniq is very very high compared with Symph and Vibros. This 2 are not bad, but Harmoniq are top level.
Hi, This headset is USB so do not comes any 3.5mm Plug to connect, its only for Pc Computers.
yes, right
Absolutely, the good thing about this specific model is it will not press around your ear, I mean the headphone is evenly flat around your ear so there is no uncomfortable spot around your ear.
The box is very nice. it's lined, and has a flop-over section that keeps it shut. Nice storage for the headphones, but I use it for other things....it's that nice. User manual? Eh...just big. Other stuff is nerd-riffic! If you are not into gaming, it's nothing special.
there is a volume control on the headset although I use it on my PC. I have a feeling it would still work for PS3. Hope this helps.
swivels up and down to out of way and is flexible boom
Unfortunately it won't work the 360. The mic for the 360 works through the controller with a small cable that plugs in the bottom. You won't be able to hear either so it won't work with the 360 at all. The 360 lacks the necessary software drivers to run the sound.
Works fine on my 2009/2010 macbook pro, so you should be good to go
I don't have a PS3 but I can tell you that it only has a USB.
I do not think so. I only have a PC, but the box and instructions only address the PC and say system requirements == Windows 8, 7, and Vista.
I used the USA and Germany so far and both coaches celebrated the same way (nothing unique) so I'm assuming Piojo would not celebrate like he would in real life.
Hi. This game NEVER worked. we could not use it in USA. there was an error for area code. probably was for an other zone. be careful!
This game should be in three different languages, English, Spanish, and French.
yes
National teams only. It includes all 203 that participated in the tournament.
Yes of course.
Yep this is it
No this game isn't
Yes it is

Yes you can, no code is needed in this version
its not coming out for PS4 or Xbox One ONLY PS3 & Xbox360. Check out the EARLY Unboxing here http://www.youtube.com/ThePapigfunk
Yes
Yes, pretty similar to dream teams from previous versions of FIFA.
Thank you for contacting us. You are unable to play with the women's team from the game you are inquiring about.
I gave this as a gift. I'm sorry I do not know.
No

500
Yes it is.

The PS3 slim console, one black wireless controller with charging cable, and The Last of Us game. HDMI cable NOT included.
No.
I haven't had any issues yet, other than an occasional sound bug where it will go in and out, where I have to restart the system. no yellow light of doom just yet, but i've only had it for a few weeks now, hopefully that doesn't arrive to my console. you can definitely tell a difference in quality from the original ps3s tho. this one feels kinda cheap. it has a sliding door for the disks where as the other one was built kinda like the ps4. in retrospect id rather have the old style ps4. it was sleeker and didn't look and feel as cheap
I was surprised by that too. I don't really know why that is the case. If I were to guess they may have stopped production of those models (the 250gb Last of Us and the 500gb slim). Since there are less of those models in the wild now Amazon may be pricing them higher. That was my reasoning but I don't have any definitive information.

Yes
DRM is Uplay. The DRM is mentioned under the product title.
It's super easy to play with a keyboard and mouse. There were even times where i would lay down while I played. You only use about 6 buttons on the keyboard, and they are all pretty close to each other. If you don't already have a gamepad, i would suggest not getting one for this game.
Yes
You must play on-line by UPLAY.
I don't think so because you have to make a uplay account so that would mean only one saved game but you can always finish the game first and then you can delete your file to your sister can play.

It currently works with all video apps except for Youtube. The Media Remote will launch the Youtube app if you select it but it won't let you scroll through videos or play anything once you're in the app. To actually use the app, you need to use your controller, at least until Google updates the Youtube app itself for compatibility with the Media Remote.
It's like a regular TV remote (it's only "on" when it transmits a signal). The only difference is that if you move it the buttons light up.
It uses batteries, although I use rechargeable ones.
It works the same as a controler just with out ABYX buttons it has a ok and back button arrows and basics play functions.
You can use the remote but it is not instant. You hold the button and a message comes up and you have to arrow up to "turn off console". Not instant but pretty quick.
No. Just the xbox one.
Yeah they change the channel. Do different things depending on application too
No, not that I am aware of. And with the lack of CEC-HDMI capability, it is doubtful. The current IR blaster support for receivers is very basic.
No, this works using IR and only communicates with Xbox One right now
It will control any features that the Xbox One can control on the Tivo. So, if the TV app has been set up to control the box, and you can control play/pause, fast forward, and rewind with the Xbox, then the remote can control those features as well. The only difference I have noticed is, you will sometimes have to press the select button after the action button - so to fast forward, you will press the fast forward key (which will show the Xbox controls, with the fast forward option highlighted) then press the select button to send the fast forward command to the box.
Yep you can. Good luck.
Yes, it will provide game and chat audio to any headphones, however you can't chat back without a mic in the headphones
Yes I have s gold headset and use it for both consoles. With the ps4 it is completely wireless and with the xbox one you'll need to plug the headset into the controller adaptor, so while for the xbox it's not totally wireless it still requires no connection to the console itself.
Yes it will. I use my TB XP500 using this adapter and a 2.5mm cable which I had to buy separate. I believe your A50's already have the cable so you would be set. Enjoy the way your headset's were meant to be used, finally.
No only Xbox one controllers
Yes it's going to provide audio from any app you open in the xbox one.
No it can not just so they could make extra money on product sales
The only mic volume that you can adjust is the one from other people that are talking to you. I don't know if you can change how loud your mic is though.
The device itself only has 1 3.5mm jack that handles all input and output, so out of the box: No. You would only be able to connect 1 3.5mm cable. However, you may be able to find 3.5mm joiners that can combined the two cables into 1. You have to research and make sure you get an adapter with enough contacts in the right spots to ensure everything gets joined and sent through properly.
Some controllers, such as both of mine, require a quick process of updating your controller. It's quite simple. 1. Place adapter on controller and turn on controller. 2. Plug in headphones. You'll be prompted if firmware is needed along with the following steps. 3. Plug the Micro USB cord into the back of your xbox and to your controller. 4. Wait 5. When finished it'll ask if you would like to do another controller, go ahead do them all and be done with it. Whole process took me about 2-4 minutes and that's never have had done it before and doing 2 controllers. Quite easy and on screen prompts tell you everything you need. Big kudos to MS for making what could be a real pain in the butt into something easy and nearly idiotproof.
Yes the headphones require Microsoft's adapter.The adapter is included though.
No, the audio plays on the headset and television simultaneously. I find myself turning the television volume all the way down so you can't hear it anymore and just using the headset. It sure helps when don't want to wake anyone up at night.
No you can't. You do miss that feature when you are used to it.
You can actually use as many as you have controls. The headset plugs directly into the control so it uses the same signal.
Yes, you can hear all apps and tv.
It just plugs into your controller. No extra batteries needed
The nice thing about this headset is that is has a standard headphone jack. You can use it with your PC no prob. Great for Skype too
It does not come with a mic monitor and you cannot hear yourself thru the mic when you speak. Sorry.
They cup over the ear but do not match the intense sound of turtle beach. I have an inexpensive set of turtle beach (X12) and the work great with the xb one. You do have to purchase the Xbox earphone adapter though. Don't pay more than 25 bucks..shop around.
Yes you can... the adapter has buttons where you can adjust the percentage of voice/game volume. If you hit the voice button until it beeps, you will only hear voice :)
no...just single
I don't think you can. Your wii probably needs to be shut down or reset. When you open the cover there should be a red button just push it and it should reset the console. It shouldn't delete anything. If not then the disc needs to be cleaned.
Yes you can I haven't tried yet but it says its compatable
No you dont you can play with the game pad an wii/nun chuck.
No it doesn't just the game disc
can the xbox one work in the uk ?considering their current
Yes and no. Let me explain. The Xbox One only comes with an HDMI out. However, you can purchase cables/converters that will go HDMI-&gt; component or standard A/V. I can't recommend any b/c I don't have any personal experience with them but if you search on Amazon you'll find plenty. But keep in mind the Xbox One is geared toward HD content and games. If you don't use an HD TV you are not getting the full benefit of the console. It would be like buying a sports car and never driving over 40 MPH. If you are going to shell out the almost $500.00 for the Xbox One then you owe it to yourself to upgrade your TV too. HD content will become the norm. Lastly, as of now most of the games for the One are being produced for the 360, which does have standard outputs. So if you don't have a HD TV now stick with the 360 and wait till you upgrade your TV. Also, if you look there are very few One games out now. Over the next few months more will be coming out but there is a very small pool of One games. So you may be better off waiting till you upgrade your TV to buy a One anyway. Hope this helps.
Hi danny, unfortunately....xbox one only accepts xbox one games. We cannot play xbox 360 games on it.
sadly you can't. The Titanfall bundle only comes with one Xbox One controller, but currently that's all you'll need since there aren't too many multiplayer Xbox One games available yet. I ordered a second controller on Amazon for the future but still haven't needed to open it. Hope this helps
It does! I was actually surprised that it did.
500 GB
If you believe the NSA can spy on you through your kinect than you would be foolish not to believe the NSA cannot spy on you through your cell phone or laptop camera. In other words, if you own a smart phone I think a kinect is the least of your worries... Nice try though.
Unfortunately right now that is a no. I did read that Microsoft is working on backwards compatibility.
Yes
It does not need internet, they changed the format when people started complaining. It is best to use internet so you can play multiplayer games.
It does, I have a Mac myself and my only problem was the shift key doesn't work with Mac so you have to use the control key as a shift button. Other than that it's a great key board for Mac.
Dear Angelpunk18, we can recommend our keyboards, but you choose any of it which you are prefer to.Thank you.
Dear Angelpunk18, yes it has the shortcut Fn+F6 and you can Press Fn+Esc to adjust the brightness. Thank you.
Dear Jeffrey W, yes ,it is compatible with Macs. Thank you.
This keyboard doesn't have an nkro mode to my knowledge....in the vast majority of cases, NKRO is PS/2 only, while this is a USB board
No it doesn't which is the only thing wrong with this keyboard. The keys are comfortable and we love it even without the stands
It has good key response! No problems with this keyboard at all!

yes the UK PS3 version is fully compatible with the USA PS3 console, but you may need an HD hook-up (HDMI) connection to your screen. (just to note that the UK 360 version is region locked and cant be used on a US 360 console)
Yes
I thing mxgp 14 is the US version. Mxgp originally released in Europe.
It should be okay to play in your country. I live in the U.S. and I bought the game from the U.K. Worked fine. I don't think Playstation has zone restrictions like XBOX does.
yes sure %

Yes. It has two player co op or versus offline
victory book pre-order only.sorry.
You could play 2 vs 2 but the game is only 2 players. It work by you and a friend fight together with computers or fight each other with a computer partner. And if you want a 1 vs 1 press the triangle button on the square where you pick a character. If not then a computer will still be there. I hope I explained this well to you.
&#33521;&#35486; I will answer your question. Shipping in case of SAL flights, will take 14 to 21 mm. Shipping in case of EMS service, it is can be delivered in about a week. Thank you.
Yes, the Playstation 3 is region free. (It can play games from any region)
That's odd. Mines works perfectly fine
Yes!!! and it works perfect
Yes I have a a copy and I live in America with a American ps3
It's all Japanese
Yes sir it is :)

No. The reason it's not included is because the Vita version has a different enemy count per location you visit (a smaller number of baddies so the system can handle it).
It is both. A shooter with rpg elements such as health and a very robust looting system. Millions of different guns generated randomly.
It's a Download from the PSN store with a voucher code included. It took up roughly 1.5-2 gb that I had to clear some room for.
They are available as a voucher code in the game case. They require to be downloaded from PSN.
Load times are not bad. Frame rate drops some. I don't play multiplayer so I dont know if it reduces the number. Its better on console, but all in all a very enjoyable vita game.
Retail copy only requires 10 mb unless you want to download the extra content. There are 2 large downloads the come with the voucher code but the rest are tiny. I would say total you would need at least 1.5-2 gb to get everything.
Only have the download code with the DLCs. The code was from a Borderlands PS Vita bundle. Sorry I don't have what you're looking for.
i dont think so
No, the only cross platform functionality for this game is being able to transfer a save from PS3 to Vita and Vita to PS3
No
It's a mistake. This does not require any batteries
It's easy to press, but it's also nice and firm. You won't be accidentally pressing it down unless you have a finger made of lead; it also has a nice, muffled click when you press it down. By far my favorite mouse wheel.
You can reassign every button on this mouse (even the DPI buttons) except for the toggle button that controls the wheel functionality. The mouse's wheel can toggle between hyper scroll mode (where you can spin the wheel and it keeps spinning freely) and regular notched scroll mode. The button that toggles this mouse wheel functionality is specifically used for that purpose only.
The mouse will work with Mac. I use a Mac at work and a PC at home. From my PC at home I can program the DPI settings and save them into one of the profile slots on the mouse so that they will be the same on my Mac at work. However, you will not be able to program the button functions for the mouse through the Logitech software on the Mac. Some of the buttons are programmable via the Mac preferences pane but I've found that the Mac doesn't seem to pick up the left and right scrollwheel buttons. The DPI shift button works as expected though. Also, i want to point out that the Logitech G software does have a Mac version. And I am able to program my Logitech g500 and g602 mouse with it. My guess is that the surface calibration feature of the g502 is the thing that's holding Logitech back from making this fully compatible with Mac. They've been progressively making their other G mice mac compatible over the past couple of years. So hopefully the g502 will be added to that list at some point as well.
One notch switches one weapon. In "locked" mode, it's quite sturdy indeed and there's next to no chance of you actually scrolling the thing. In free scroll mode though, it's extremely loose and sometimes even picking up the mouse is enough to make the scroll move.
No, the light cannot be changed. They can be turned off though.
Yes. I thought nothing was going to be able to replace my G500 when it stopped working. The ergonomics were literally perfect for my hand, the free scrolling wheel, braided cable and the customizable weights. My G502 literally does all of that, just better. Word of caution though, as I was used to the G500 which is noticeably bigger than the 502 (and I have relatively small hands), you won't necessarily fall in love with it immediately. After about a week or so of use and the ergonomics will start to make sense. Once that happens, it becomes better than the 500.
All the buttons can be reassigned, including the tilt wheel. So, 11 buttons total, all of them programmable.
g502 is better in every way unless you prefer the deathadder shape or slightly lighter weight. g502 has better sensor (native at every step), build quality, software (if wanted) more buttons, features, and better customer support.
Yes in the logitech software you can change tje action of the buttons. You van use the two buttons in the left side too. I use one to melee attack and the other for throwing grenades
Depending on the WiFi network you are trying to attach to, you may or may not need a network key to attach. The console itself doesn't create a WiFi to hook up to. No extra devices are needed to use the WiFi feature other than having wireless internet at home or wherever the intended location may be. You can also use a wired connection with an Ethernet cable, sold separately I'm sure. Hope that answers your question.
I would check the back of the TV or the sides, for any HDMI slots. If it has HDMI slots, you can connect your XBOX 360 E using an HDMI cable. If your TV does not have any HDMI slots, this bundle actually includes a 'regular, non HDMI' cable. Neither PS3s or Xbox360s come with HDMI cables included. :)
The downloads come from the internet, but the discs are personally purchased. No Internet is needed for the discs.
It looks like 2 from best I can tell. We found wireless ones almost same price so went that way.
No, you cant.
The price will vary by seller.
Yes
Two, I'm pretty sure. It's at least that much
2014-07-12
certain games are backwards compatible but in my opinion it doesn't work that well.
I downloaded it to my new pro, and a friend has it on his air. Runs flawlessly on both.
Sure does, running it right now. If you're loading up a big game it'll be a little slow to start but I've found that to be the case regardless of platform or OS. Hope this helps
You need Steam to download the program and get any updates. They also seem to force you to check in with them every once in a while, since the program occasionally will not work until you do. However, you can play the game off line. What I do is turn WiFi off before I boot Civilization V. This allows you to play the game without being connected to Steam.
You cannot. Moreover, you cannot run it offline.
Yes! I play with yosemite all the time
I've played the game offline dozens of times, though it does prefer you to be online for cloud based save file storage (in offline mode it saves a local copy). When I bought the game i was emailed a "Product Code" to activate it. Searching online I found answers that Amazon emails you the Online Game Code to activate the game. It basically means you're getting the game's activation code by email rather than printed and mailed to you.
You have to download Steam (free) and input your code through there.

yes, the paddle shifters works well in Forza 5
Yes it does
This was a present for my 10 year old and decided to get one of those adjustable stands that it mounts too. It's works well! You can mount to a desk but it will probably need a base then the base can mount to the desk. There are pre tapped holes in the bottom for screws to go into.
The instruction manual that came with the wheel should tell you how to re-calibrate it, but if you don't have it, here is the link to Thrustmasters website and the pdf file for the instruction manual to troubleshoot and re calibrate the Ferrari 458 Spider wheel for Xbox One. Only the first half of the first page is the english instructions, all the rest of the file is for other languages. You will have to enlarge it in order to read it. Hope this helps. http://ts.thrustmaster.com/download/accessories/Manuals/Ferrari_458_Spider/F458_Spider_User_Manual.pdf
No, it's for an xbox one
IT work real good but real sensitive
Yes
Having problems with the gas pedal as well. If it doesn't start working as advertised, Im sending it back.
Don't mind these guys, they haven't done their research. The TP3A pedals work (as confirmed by Thrustmaster themselves), but the TH8A shifter does not as it requires a certain port that is only on the Thrustmaster TX. The TH8A does come with a USB cable but it will not work through the USB ports of the Xbox One. Hope I was of some help!
Yes, you can in Forza Horizon 2. In the CONTROL settings, you have 5 different preset configurations. It's 'Default Layout 5'
Yes sir, it works with all systems in the 3ds family. Power saves actually never touches the 3ds unit, instead works by using the power saves to plug the cartridge into the computer and then use the software to modify the games existing save file. A way too look at the device is it's built similarly to a SD card reader, but instead for 3ds games.
It only works when you have the game card.
Yes, since the new 3DS can still run 3DS games it should always work. The action replay powersaves only edits with your computer on applying codes inside the game cartridges.
Unfortunately not. We had to use a PC, which was BootCamp on a Mac for us.
Yes it works with the new games
The cartridge is one thing the console that's another story, the one taking the code modification is the cartridge not the 3DS. So if you was to corrupt data on something it would be the game, and the Game saves has a backup feature that can undo something. So you can have fun just don't over do it, let it do what you tell it to. Once it's done don't pull the cartridge out, exit the software then pull the cartridge out keep it simple.
This is not a video game recorder or streaming device. This is a device that can back up your existing 3DS save files onto a computer, and then you can edit those save files to change the data in your game.
Yes. it's English version only, but not regional games from another country.
Powersave PRO got License key which should be US. Some may be EU keys instead of US which is why it sometimes works for others with this product. Regular Powersave (yellow package) should have License key for EU, in this case, for UK. If your license key is from the other region, you can contact Datel to change the license key's currently region (EU &lt;-&gt; US) to the other. Website: https://powersaves3ds.maximummemory.com/support/
nope. don't see an option to do that from the interface. The save file option are save files stored in the action replay servers
Yes, when you buy it you get an unused game code. The person receiving the code just needs to make an NCSoft Account and redeem the code on their site.
Yeap, it's just a code. They will just discontinue to sell them as it gives a few extras :)
The bonuses are mostly access to the closed betas (now over) and registering you guild and character name (currently going on till the 23rd). Other than that you get three day early head start. But yes, if you order now you'll get what bonuses remain. Regular vs. deluxe determine what in-game loot you get. Visit the game's website to see the differences. Cheers!
It's a subscription required game. It's about $15 (USD) per month with a declining scale if you subscribe at 3, 6, etc months. You get the first 30 days free though.
They come with purchase and were sent to my email sometime after the official launch. If you purchased this and are expecting passes but haven't received them, I recommend contacting WildStar customer support.
Probably not. But you get some nice mounts. A rocket house. couple of housing items. some dyes and costume. Titles. To me.. I bought the deluxe version to save me the time of grinding money to get a mount. The ones you get you cannot use till level 25. they are giving a way a mount right now if you sign up for 2-step login verification. you cam use right away

You get everything except for a title, green dye, and a hoverboard.
I would assume so. they email you the code. Then your friend should be able to make their own account w/ their email.
yes $14.99 per month. don't know if u buy more then 1 month will price go down. u can also get in game $$$ buy selling your monthly fee or if u have enough in game $$$ u can buy a monthly fee.
It sure does! They'll email the passes to you after a couple days and then you're free to send them to your friends.
It's is just a registration code to give you access to the game. You use the code on the WildStar website and then download the game.
Yes, in fact it's the only way to play on US servers. If you buy a code from one of their European gates, or even through a European amazon gate, it will only be good for Euro servers. I bought a code on US amazon for a friend in Europe and we play together on US servers.
My best friend is an all mac guy and I'm afraid he's not going to be able to play WildStar at all. They definitely won't have mac support at release. I have read several forum entries that say don't try to play Wildstar on Parallels because the delay on the MAC is overwhelming. I know some people are now trying to setup Bootcamp and make it work but it doesn't sound positive. I would definitely wait till Carbine comes out with a MAC client..
You'll be able to play it. Probably not not on full specs. Your RAM and GPU are fine, but a 2.0GHz processor is a bit slow. If you have the i7 it probably has TurboBoost. You should check out what the max speed is with the boost, if it's above 2.4 you can definitely play it. If not you will probably have too low of a framerate for this game, it requires a lot of aiming and avoiding, which gets tough at low FPS.

Yes
There are a huge lineups for International and Domestic teams. In Domestic arena, a current generation of lineups from Australian T20, Indian Premier League and English Cricket County. When you start playing career mode, you will be offered a contracts playing for Big Bash Australian T20 League, Indian Premier League (IPL) and English County Championship. There are also vintage lineups besides the current teams from 1980's West Indies and Pakistan, 1990's Australia's teams. All of the above you can customize and create your own lineups too.
No
It's region free.... I bought from UK and I am using it in USA.
No I you can't
It supports up to 2 players either in the same room or via network play. It is a UK game though, so in order to support network play between 2 players a buyer would have to create a second PSN Network account under the U.K. network rather than the U.S. network if he doesn't already have a U.K. network account. it's free to do so.
yes it will work in American PS3 without any problem.
Yes
It has all the international teams. And you can download fan made rosters through the game so u have updated rosters for each team.

You can use it to replace the sticks on the ps4 controller. See how here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXyoH50xteE .
It is about $5 and
J. Yuan is very wrong. They are incredibly different. These thumb sticks should have been originally on the PS4 controller to begin with. The original sticks were made of very crappy material and the rubber tips wear off so fast. With these sticks, you can absolutely feel the difference. They are very responsive because they are slightly taller which means they actually give you more control. No dead zone by what I can find. I played Destiny heavily for a full day with the new sticks and honestly, they are so much more comfortable. Honestly, I say just buy them. They are not expensive and it's an easy swap procedure. I promise you that you will enjoy them. Its hard to describe the feel of them besides that they grip your thumb and stay in place where you want it. Them being slightly taller means you have more control. For me the biggest selling point was the material they are made of. You can just feel that it is a stronger and better quality material. For a controller costing almost $70, you would think they could put a quality rubber on the thumb stick but they didn't. Bad news for Sony. Just buy these and put them in. You will think like me and go, "Wow! These are the best thing Microsoft ever made for Sony!"
I've had mine for a few months. Only issue I came across was my own issue. I didn't tighten a screw all the way and I thought my sticks where warped. After I tightened it, the sticks worked good.
No
It will work.
These are made for the Xbox One controllers and will work with the Sony PS4 controllers. As of any Nintendo product I cannot say because we don't distribute those. I would say its worth a shot if you like to tinker, they only cost a few bucks.
We are selling actual XBone sticks with the rougher edges to the nubs but not sure others. Thanks,
1 set of 2 sticks. They are awesome--far better than the stock PS4 analogs.
It is fairly easy to do. And it will take you 10-15 minutes to do. I would recommend to look for YouTube videos about how to dismantle a DualShock 4, as there are little parts that require attention and be careful to handle. I hope this helps.
Yes it's $15 a month. The game new comes with a 30 day subscription. You can pay online or buy game time cards at the store. You do not need PlayStation plus to play this game online.
The box of the actual game is 11 x 8 inches. It came in a box 17 x 16 inches. Depth of about 2 inches for both.
It's an expansion.
When you activate the game it will allow you to add ps4 to your existing account.
It should as far as I know. PS4 isn't region locked and FFXIV has a European server, so I don't see why it wouldn't.
Yes, it will be in you mail in the gm
There is a trial period
No, if PSN is down sometimes you can still log in, updates come less often but its fast
Yes. For instance, I own the game on PS4 but am able to play with one friend who has it on PS3 and another who has it on PC.
No they are bound to you
No, this is a single-player action RPG.
As for audio, you can purchase the Japanese voice tracks for the whole main game (not the DLC missions), but the subs are English only as far as I know.
No, just English and Japanese.
This game is NOT Demonic and it certainly isn't Satanic. As for sexuality, besides the outfit you see the main character in on the cover, and the , very, occasional innuendo from the "old perv" character, there is little sexual in nature about this game. This game is more swords and sorcery. No demons and NO satanic material.
Branch A is the main branch of the game. You don't need to do anything to unlock it, just play normally. To unlock Branch D, you need to do the Lost Verses and get all the weapons.
Tentatively. Don't buy it if you're deaf, though. There's reasons. Anyway, if you go into this thinking it will be either Nier or Drakengard 1 you'll be disappointed. But make no mistake that the emotion and writing you'd expect will be there. The humor is juvenile and not always funny, but it fits into the theme of the game: Contrast. For every joke there's a tear, and for every smile there's a funeral. The characters aren't as immediately memorable, but the Zero and her dragon Mikhail have an amazing chemistry that just overshadows everything else anyway. The overall story is a great take on the concepts of "series canon" and timeline effects. You'll first need to know that each ending has a completely separate sequence of events, unlike in Nier where each new ending path led to more context on the situation. Ultimately Draken3 feels like a medieval fantasy timeline story, like a sort of "Steins;Gate" but Drakengard style. The other answerer to your question is rather on point, too. Ultimately it will feel very unique but worth it. Some moments will fall flat while others will be as amazing as you'd hope and each ending is unarguably charged with an explosion of emotions and revelations. Don't go into it expecting Nier, but you can expect quality.
Only buying the dlc for them .
it is a disk
you get a traditional dvd plastic case with a code on a slip of paper inside
You don't have to buy the discs, you can download it online. You do have to pay an initial cost, but when you do, it comes with 30 days play time included. Afyerwards you just pay the sub.
Yes. It is a global code.
Beats me, I thought I would get an email with the code or a number, but I had to wait for the physical card. Same thing for WOW.
i wouldn't risk it
Wireless. Playstation doesn't make wired controllers for the ps3 or ps4. They are blutooth so they have far better range than other console controllers.
no
It comes in a cardboard sleeve.
It's the super slim, top-loading model.
It has one controller with charge cable.
Yes
You could plug your PS3 to your PC using an optical audio cable, and then you could use the PC speakers with your PS3
nO i'M AFRAID NOT
Absolutely!
No it would be a regular controller.
I haven't had a single issue with tracking on any surface I have used it on. As long as the surface is flat it tracks better than any of my razer mice. I would say it tracks far better than my old deathadder. Hope this helps!
Palm
Thanks for your inquiry to our product. Yes, they have no difference. The aLLreli mouse is from our factory. And we supply the item and driver for them. Thanks for bringing this matter to our attention. EC Technology Customer Support cs@iectechnology.com
Yes! And in perfect condition. It does NOT come with a ps vita memory card though.
Yes the old model with the OLED screen
no the ps vita does not have any regional restrictions to it. it's like the ps3, so long as you have a psn account you can use it anywhere.
There a difference between recertified and refurbished. Refurbed is sold as is usually, whereas recertified still carries a warranty. Both are used and/or fixed models, which is to the reason for the lower price.
Yes it does! And the start up guide and a manual. Everything originally in the box
No, it does not come with the cards
Yes
I got the 16G it's perfect for me, I downloaded a few games(4) and still have plenty of space.
No
Nope, game won't start without a memory card, I tried.

If you pre-order the game, it becomes the Limited Edition. Otherwise, it's a standard edition. That said, I have found 'special editions' of games like this after the launch dates. Overstock from unbought pre-orders and such, but it can also be because of swag that is shipped with every version of a game sold in a particular method.
It will not work with windows xp because this game requires directx11 which xp does not support.
not on mine it didn't. I wish it would have cause I have all od the other Tropico games
Go to the tropics website and download the hot fix to repair the box install
I would contact Kalypso, the game developer
When u buy the download, you have to replace the .exe with a non steam version. A quick Google search and you should find a forum or something that should point you in the right direction
Yes
I use a site like 'can I play this' to check whether a game will run on my computer. I play on a toshiba satellite with integrated graphics card, with no problem
Yes it can, it is mostly offline but you choose to play onkine
You can buy the CD-ROM from Amazon.
Yes all 3ds games will work on 2ds. The 2ds is just a 3ds without the 3D feature, that is the only difference.
Yes it is. As the rating suggests, it says E for everyone :)
No, 3/2ds only
Nicknames are used whenever a Mii is referred to. Only when a Mii is hosting a news program or is one of the interview subjects is their full name used or spoken, so use nicknames you don't mind hearing a lot!
Nah, you'll be alright
No, I don't believe there is a way to have separate save files for each player. When you save it doesn't let you pick a file.
all games are able to restart and be able to create new games. So yes you will be able to make a new game.
sure is
Yes, definitely! There are several little mini games you can play with your Miis that I'm sure a ten year old would have fun with. The Miis do get together and date, get married, and have children. But nothing is ever really shown save for the couple having little hearts floating over their heads when they're around another. And children just appear after the couple asks if it's okay for them to have a baby. I would recommend this for any child :)
You can make the kids share a game, but I don't think they'll be very happy with you. Each copy of the game only has one save file on it, meaning only one person can make a seperate game. I'd say you either chip in and buy the three copies of the game, get them used for a lower price, or have the kids fight over which miis get to have certain outfits. Your choice.

The $19.99 is the current price of the PS3 game. If Amazon drops the price before the release date, you will get a refund of the difference between the two prices.
For other players to join your game, they simply need to press start with their own controllers. Also note that split-screen only works on HD TVs where the PS3 is connected to the TV with an HDMI.
There is a demo and this version has parental controls.
If you like building... It's kinda like Lego in a virtual world. You can build buidings & other thing's. Fun for kid's & adults
No you do not. Only if you want to play multiplayer
Yes
You don't need any online connection.
Please refer to the manufacturer Playstation website for content of this game
This is how somebody summed it up in a forum I found on this subject. "Technically a PS3 game from any region can work on a PS3 console from any region. However multiplayer might be more complicated, some games may force you to play with others from the same region as the game. Other games will be fine. Also I believe DLC is not region free, so you'll have to make sure any DLC is bought for the game's region." On the last part, I'm assuming that would mean that you'd need to buy any DLC from the US playstation store instead of the UK store. Also important to note with this specific game; If you intend to do lots of online play, you may wanna do more research on this particular game. I play on a US PS3 with a US copy, and I play with my gf who is in New Zealand, so I would assume the online should be fine for playing with others of any region. Hope I didn't ramble too much. And I hope it helps. Good luck with your purchases!

Hi there, This game cannot be played on the Play Station 2.
This game continues from where the anime is at, and it appears to be showcasing what will happen in the future. I highly recommend you watch up to episode 650, and you'll be safe! Enjoy the show and journey, cause this game will offer a lot of it. ^_^
That's the beauty of this game. This game is intended for new and old One Piece fans! You won't feel lost at all. You'll learn along the way, which character is which. =D
Yes, it has subtitles. Here is the beginning (51 minutes) of the English version of the game if you want to see what it will look like: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0dM3LShhdo
The dlc will be able to be purchased from within the game, that connects to the e shop. ^_^ (Like an online store from inside the game).
You need two copies bro
It's English
Hard copy
I would love to give you answer but I've only played the 3DS version.... But I'm sure the only difference would be even better graphics on the wii U and controls would be slightly different... You can maybe look up videos on YouTube to get a better answer though... Sorry I couldn't answer your question
Yes he is, and he's playable.
the standard edition won't give you the free costume dlc, and extra side-quest.
it will work on macs, i got euro truck sim to work. all u have to do is download wineskin and it will open the windows 7 file
I bought on Amazon and then downloaded it thru my steam account. There are directions on amazon on how to download it thru steam
You don't need a steam account to buy it but you do need an account to play it.
I used a wired 360 controller but not all the buttons were mapped I think it was the hitch button but that may be fixed now
There's ways around it tht I haven't done. There is a system called bootcamp
To be honest idk srry
I have been seeing a lot of PC Games having this issue playing on Windows 8.1 because they have been configured to play on windows 7,and 8. 8.1 was a free add on for people to customize windows 8 to look and feel like windows 7. You can go to WWW.Microsoft.com/windows8 to uninstall the 8.1 add on so you can have windows 8.0 again. I recommend this until we see games compatable for windows 8.1
Yes wat kind of laptop windows or Mac
I'm not shore it should work as it works with my Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick. You can try and see if it works you can let me know.
Yes you can. I personally download from spintires.nl, but I'm sure there's other websites. Although I should note is that if put mods into the game, you'll not be able to play multiplayer until you take the mods out of the game. BACK UP YOUR FILES!!! I can't stress that enough. It's a little different adding mods than from the demo version.

It is a 500gb hard drive but after the operating system and such it is a 362gb hard drive to play with.
Yeah. They are supposed to release it separately. That way you can add it later. Maybe they'll bundle it with a game like the first one.
No, you couldn't many of the engines used to create those are unsupported or you have to buy a new version of it.
Kinect is for Motion Gaming, using Gestures to control the Xbox, and most importantly voice commands. Sadly no, a different external microphone will not work for voice commands. Head over to feedback.xbox.com and suggest it, maybe they will add it.
Yes.
Yes
No but games like titanfall are online but other you can play with out having to be connected online or having a membership
yes, games can all be played offline. The system is fully operational offline.
Only compatible with TVs that have an HDMI port so no. It might be time to upgrade. Good 32" TV sell for $250
Most games do not require kinect. Some games have certain kinect-enabled features and others will rely on kinect extensively. It will be marked on the game packaging if kinect is required.
Yes, this will surely work with apple devices and Nexus 5.
The Gembonics charger comes with a 3-in-1 cable which includes micro USB port so you just use that to charge it. You can connect it to the computer for a USB wall outlet. you dont need to buy anything else :)
Yes - you can use your device while this is plugged in. However, depending on your device and usage, this 5600 mAh unit may or may not charge it as fast as you are draining the battery. (Reading a book is probably fine, but playing games or watching video may only extend the time before you run out of juice.) You can get around that by simply recharging your device (Kindle HD) before it is almost dead.
Yes, that is what I have.
Yes I was able to use my tablet while in use. It is as same as plugging in to the wall charger.
Dear April, dont worry. We have just sent you new one which should be with you in few days, Gembonics Customer Team
Yes, I've looked up the alpha and checked the charging port, it looks like it will fit the Android cable.
It works with my 4s, So I'll go ahead and say yes with confidence!
Well we have a iPad, iPhone 4, and a iPhone 5s , I think the iPod nano has the same plug as the iPhone 4 and if it does then yes it will work
It's quite easy. It has a micro usb port for charging. You can invert the cable and plug the usb to a pc or to your phone charger. Or, you can use any usb/microusb cable and plug to a pc or a phone charger with a usb port.
Dear Mario, The price goes up and down due to sometimes promotions are running by Gembonics. We have started another promotion from today so you will see the prices are down so let's grab your Color before promotion ends as the discount offer is live for limited time. Hope that answers your question. Regards, Gembonics Customer Satisfaction Team
Yes it does work with the new generation of the iPods.
I'm not sure but I believe it does. the 1 I have charged a android tablet and a iPhone so I'm assuming it wouldn't be a problem for a Nokia phone.
The item comes with a cord for charging. We use the USB port in the computer or you can use any USB port electric converter plug. This device can charge your cell and iPod and an Android phone at same time! SUCH A HANDY TOOL! My husband has iPhone, I have Note II, we can charge both!
Yea
No
Simply answered, yes. It comes with a 3-in-1 adapter. It is quite an amazing tool.
4 by 1 1/2 inches
I was able to charge Gembonics battery with iPhone 5c.... -- Just plug your normal phone cable with the device and charge it..
The Gembonics charger comes with a 3-in-1 cable which includes micro USB port so you can just use that to charge it by using your wall adapter or Alternatively you can connect it to the computer or laptop USB port.
