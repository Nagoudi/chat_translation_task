Any weight balance issue? The G500 had a "floating center weight" that shifts and tug the mouse as you glide it, does the G500s suffers this? Thanks.

How is this wheel mounted? Example I have the Microsoft 360 Wheel &amp; it has a clamp to attach it to a desk.
Does this have the most recent update? And did they fix all of the earlier batch problems?
Is this wheel compatible with Windows 8.1?
Can you buy the power cable separately, as I've lost mine. Or is it a proprietary connector, which I need to buy one direct from thrustmasters
Is there a version of this wheel to avoid? I heard some of the earlier batches had problems.
I really want to get this wheel since it's the cheapest force feedback option for Xbox One but the durability issues concern me. Is it worth risking?
