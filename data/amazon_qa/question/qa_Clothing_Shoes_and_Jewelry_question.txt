Are these gloves battery operated?
are they good for -20?
how do you size these gloves?
Are these the latest version? The one with the hand warmer zipper and touch screen sensitive index and thumb?
According to the guide here (around hand), I am a 10. According to the Heritage's official sizing (by length of hand), I am an 11. My best bet?
Will these gloves allow me to work well with nuts, bolts, ect. ?
Why are the size 10 not available through Prime? This seems odd. I don't feel like paying an extra $10.
Do these gloves work well to grip a car steering wheel and shifter? Would I be able to take a key out of a pant pocket with these gloves on?
I have a problem with my fingers being cold when I walk my Dog, every pair of gloves I tried failed to keep them warm. Will these gloves be any better.

Is there any way to plug them into the cigarette lighter I installed on my handlebars? Some sort of adapter?
how do they operate?on battery?I'd need them on motorbike but I'm not so skilled with managing electric parts please be detailed thanks
Will these work in an automobile, too? My husband has Raynaud's Syndrome and always has cold hands. Will they plug into cigarette lighter?
Same question as below about 12V socket? I have cable attached to battery for use w/battery tender. Would wiring harness mentioned plug into it?
Does the heating element go all the way to your finger tip?
I plan on running these through my Gerbing heated jacket. Should they work as well as running them straight to the battery?
Do they heat the thumb also?
Can I connect it to my lawn tractor's battery (under the seat)? I use the tractor with a snow plow blade in winter and leaf-mulch in fall.
How thick are these gloves? I have a pair of thin summer motorcycle riding gloves, and would like to know if these could fit under them..

I'm thinking of using this for hauling books and papers to class rather than for carrying a laptop. Does the interior layout work well for that? Also, wondering if it is balanced and sits upright well, or might tend to fall over.

Is this water resistant? Wanted to use it for light rain
I have 2 questions: first does it have a hood, and second is the material noisy or stiff?
Is it lined?
Can I wear this as an outer jacket for a week-long ski trip if I layer with fleece and base layers underneath?
would like to know the measures of size XL I'm afraid it is chia, and I see that some stay small for them .. thanks
Is this jacket lined inside? I want something that slides right on - maybe nylon only inside. Also is the fit relaxed or fitted?
does this jacket actually run small?! thanks

my son wears a 10.5 shoe. What size sock?
Maybe I'm overlooking it but I can't see in the product details how many pairs I get for $12
I'm a girl. Can I wear these socks?
size guide
HI, how many pairs comes for each package?
I wear a size 12 should I get the Lg or XLg
I'm in between a 10.5 and an 11. Would it be better to go a little bit to big with the size Large, or a little bit to small with the size Medium?
are these machine washable and machine dryable?
How durable are these?
How high up do these go? Do they fall/roll down after prolonged use?
for shoe size 46, what size sock?
What are these for? Are you supposed to use them only in "fingered" shoes (like Vibrams), or regular shoes as well?
should these feel right around the big toe? I got large, then medium but now I'm thinking after a wash, large may fit me better.
Hand or machine wash these for the longest durability?
